“The BMW 2 Series Active Tourer offers a compelling blend of practicality and style, appealing to both families and those seeking a refined MPV. Its design, sharing a similar aesthetic to the X1, makes it a versatile option for driving. While the Mercedes BClass boasts a slightly more exciting exterior, the 2 Series Active Tourer’s generous rear space and comfortable interior provide a very good package.

The engine choices are diverse. The standard 2.0litre diesel delivers good fuel economy and performance, reaching 60 mph in 8.8 seconds. The petrol models offer a more substantial boost, with acceleration times ranging from 7.0 to 8.1 seconds. The plugin hybrid versions provide electric range and substantial performance. The 225e offers 56 miles on electric power, while the 220i and 223i deliver a more thrilling driving experience.

The interior is well-designed, though the infotainment system can be a bit confusing. It’s customizable and user-friendly, though the digital display isn’t as clear as the Audi Q2's. Comfortable seats and good space in the rear make it a practical choice for its class. The boot is surprisingly spacious, easily accommodating a large family or luggage.

The overall driving experience is enjoyable, with good visibility and a comfortable ride. Steering is responsive, but the suspension can be firm over bumps. The ride quality is also quite good.  Overall, the BMW 2 Series Active Tourer is a well-rounded vehicle, offering a balance of practicality, comfort, and driving pleasure, and represents a strong value proposition.”

“The BMW X2 offers a stylish and compact SUV with a distinctive design, though it’s not without its quirks. It shares a platform with the X1, offering a familiar driving experience, but the X2’s sharper styling and grille create a more eye-catching appearance. While the interior feels familiar and comfortable, some find the materials slightly underwhelming. Handling is generally good, with a steering wheel that provides a decent connection to the road. The X2’s compact size makes it easy to maneuver in urban environments, but its sloping roof limits headroom and rear visibility. The rear window is narrow, which can make it challenging for taller passengers. Boot space is adequate for everyday use, though not exceptionally generous.

The X2’s performance is adequate for typical driving conditions. The 20i engine provides sufficient power for city driving, while the M35i model offers quicker acceleration. However, the M35i’s spirited driving experience is more engaging than the X2’s smoother ride.

Cost is a key consideration. The X2 is more affordable than the X1 and other models, but the M35i XDrive version offers a substantial performance boost.

Overall, the X2 is a well-designed and practical SUV that provides a good balance of style, comfort, and value. It’s a solid choice for those seeking a smaller, more distinctive SUV.”

“The BMW X3 is a popular family SUV, sold over 3.5 million units since its launch in 2003. The latest model aims to stand out with its striking exterior design, modern interior, and a new plugin hybrid engine. It’s an alternative to cars like the Audi Q5, Mercedes GLC, Volvo XC60, and Alfa Romeo Stelvio. The X3 offers a compelling blend of performance, comfort, and technology.

The X3 is a good option for growing families, offering a spacious interior and a comfortable ride. It’s a stylish and practical SUV, offering a good balance of features and driving experience.  It’s a strong competitor to other SUVs like the Hyundai Santa Fe and Volkswagen Tiguan.

The X3’s engine lineup includes a 2.0-litre petrol and a 2.0-litre diesel.  The 30e plugin hybrid is a standout, boasting up to 56 miles of electric range, offering lower company car tax and potential fuel savings.

The petrol models deliver decent performance, with a comfortable 40-45 mpg, while the diesel offers a quicker 62mph. The M50 model, with its 3.0-litre six-cylinder engine, delivers more power and spirited driving.

Overall, the X3 offers a good value proposition, especially considering its design and features. Reliability is still being assessed, but BMW has consistently achieved high ratings in recent years.  The X3 is a well-rounded SUV that strikes a good balance between style, performance, and practicality, making it a viable choice for drivers seeking a capable and stylish vehicle.”

Here’s a summarized version of the review:

The BMW M135i offers a thrilling driving experience with impressive power and handling, but it's not without its drawbacks. It’s a refined and comfortable car, bolstered by modern interior design, excellent ergonomics, and a user-friendly infotainment system. While the turbocharged fourcylinder delivers quick acceleration, it lacks the engaging rearwheel drive character of the best BMWs. The M135i’s engine and gearbox are relatively straightforward, though the ride quality is a bit firm for spirited driving. Fuel economy is respectable, particularly for a high-performance hatchback, though it falls short of the best.  Safety features are well-equipped, with advanced driver aids including lane departure warning and automatic emergency braking.  Overall, the M135i is a competent and enjoyable car, offering a good balance of performance, comfort, and technology, but it's not a standout choice for all drivers.

The boot space is 440 litres, a notable improvement over the 4 Series, and comparable to the Mercedes-AMG C63’s 355 litres. The M4’s steering is sharp, though the ride can be firm, particularly in the corners. The rear bias contributes to challenging handling at higher speeds. Available with advanced driver assistance systems like adaptive cruise control and lane keeping assistance, and parking assistance, creating a safe driving experience. The M4’s infotainment system features a 12.3-inch display with M-branded controls and Android Auto/Apple CarPlay support.  While the original twinscreen setup was easier to use, the new system is intuitive and well-designed.  The M4 Competition offers four-wheel drive, increased power, and improved traction for spirited driving.  It’s a benchmark for performance, with 28.8 mpg in the rear-wheel drive model, but with higher emissions than the standard version.  The M4 offers a compelling balance of performance and emissions – a well-rounded sports car for those seeking a challenging driving experience."

Its spacious interior and advanced technology, including the 12-inch touchscreen infotainment system and Apple CarPlay/Android Auto integration, provide a comfortable and engaging journey. The car’s distinctive design, with its aggressive grille and wheels, immediately draws attention. The rear-wheel-drive layout and high-performance engine deliver exceptional acceleration, making it a capable off-road vehicle.

The 31.0-inch display offers immersive entertainment and the ability to operate the car with voice commands. Though it's a new car, initial reviews suggest the i7 possesses a good range and charging capabilities.  While it does struggle to match the Mercedes EQS on long-distance journeys, the i7’s agility and comfort in corners are impressive.  The i7's luxurious interior and advanced tech set it apart, but potential buyers should consider the vehicle's relatively new status when making a decision."

“The BMW 6 Series Convertible offers a comfortable and stylish driving experience, particularly for those who appreciate a relaxed atmosphere. The interior, though somewhat bland, is well-equipped and offers a high-quality feel. The infotainment system is user-friendly, and the roof mechanism is smooth and quiet. The engine options provide a range of performance levels, with the turbocharged inline-six offering a pleasant, smooth drive. While the rear seats are adequate for occasional use, they lack significant passenger space. The 640i and 650i offer respectable power, while the diesel offers excellent fuel economy, making it a good choice for long journeys. Overall, the 6 Series Convertible is a well-rounded option suitable for drivers who value comfort and a stylish design.”

"The M5 Touring offers a compelling blend of performance and practicality, delivering a spirited driving experience while prioritizing comfortable and sophisticated features. Its powerful engine, combined with a well-designed chassis, provides a responsive and engaging driving experience, especially on twisty roads. The interior, though slightly more cluttered than the saloon, is comfortably appointed and offers a good balance of luxury and functionality. While infotainment can be somewhat complex, the customizable M buttons offer a touch of sportiness.  Safety features are generally commendable, and its fuel efficiency is a definite plus, particularly considering its hybrid powertrain and relatively lower emissions.  However, the car's overall reliability remains a concern, as evidenced by the lower Driver Power ranking. Despite these drawbacks, the M5 Touring represents a worthwhile option for those seeking a high-performance sedan with a focus on practicality."

“The Peugeot eRifter offers a spacious and versatile family MPV with a focus on electric driving. It boasts a 50kWh battery pack for a range of 172 miles, though this may be sufficient for shorter journeys. The steering is lightweight, contributing to comfortable urban driving, though it might feel slightly detached on twisty roads. The interior design is understated, with a focus on practicality and a funky iCockpit setup. While the materials are plastic, the car’s overall space is reasonably generous, offering 1,355 litres in the standard version and 1,900 litres with the long wheelbase.

The eRifter offers good value, particularly compared to the Volkswagen ID Buzz. It's well-suited for those needing a larger vehicle for town driving and with the option of seven seats, offering a rare asset in the compact EV market. While the ride comfort is adequate, it can be bumpy, especially on longer journeys.  The steering feels a bit odd, and the handling isn't particularly sporty.

Overall, the Peugeot eRifter provides a practical and reasonably comfortable family vehicle, prioritizing space and practicality over performance. It’s a good choice for those seeking a large MPV with electric capabilities at a competitive price point.

It boasts a generous boot and comfortable seating, making it suitable for families and those needing ample cargo space. The car’s design is appealing, and the interior feels luxurious, with a focus on comfort and quality materials.

“The Peugeot E3008 offers a distinctive and stylish driving experience, though its practicality is somewhat compromised by its sleek design. It’s a comfortable family car with good visibility, offering a surprising amount of space for its size. The interior is well-designed and functional, though the materials feel a bit plasticky. The driving experience is generally smooth, though steering can be a bit sensitive and the brakes feel slightly spongy. The electric range is respectable, with up to 415 miles of range depending on the battery size, and acceleration is brisk. The dual-motor version delivers impressive performance, particularly in the higher trims.

While the safety assistance features are decent, they aren't exceptional compared to some competitors. The infotainment system, while functional, can be a bit cluttered with screens and navigating between them can be frustrating. The rear passenger space isn’t ideal, and the lack of a front boot limits versatility. Overall, the E3008 is a good choice for buyers seeking a stylish and comfortable electric SUV with a focus on design and driving dynamics, but potential owners should consider the compromises in practicality."

---

“The Peugeot e308 presents a compelling blend of stylish design and practical features, despite a higher price point than some competitors. Its interior offers a refined aesthetic and comfortable seating, though the infotainment system could benefit from refinement. Electric range is respectable, achieving 250 miles, though charging speeds are slower than other EVs, particularly the ID3 and Born. While the car's handling is pleasant, it lacks the punch and responsiveness of performance-oriented electric vehicles. Maintenance costs are expected to be lower than gasoline counterparts, making it an attractive option for company car drivers. Overall, the Peugeot e308 offers a well-rounded driving experience, offering a worthwhile value proposition.”

“Peugeot 3008 offers a stylish and tech-forward SUV coupe, with a hybrid powertrain offering a balance of fuel efficiency and performance. It boasts a widescreen display, comfortable interior, and practical space, though the ride can be a bit rough on uneven roads. The 1.2L petrol engine provides adequate power, though it lacks a self-charging electric system.  The hybrid model offers impressive efficiency and relatively low running costs, but it’s not as engaging as a pure electric vehicle.  Compared to the Nissan Qashqai, Kia Sportage, and Hyundai Tucson, it's slightly pricier but offers a good value proposition, with the Citroen C5 Aircross and Toyota CHR being more affordable. The Peugeot’s comfortable ride and interior design are noteworthy, and the steering is responsive, but the 3008’s sporty handling might not match the more dynamic driving experience of its rivals.  The 3008’s boot is adequate for most needs, but its sloping roofline can make loading large items a challenge.”

“The Peugeot e-208 offers a stylish and practical electric hatchback, combining a compact size with a competitive range and impressive features. It’s a step up from the petrol 208, offering a slightly more refined driving experience. The interior is well-designed, with a comfortable ride and a user-friendly touchscreen interface.

Compared to the Mini Cooper Electric and Cupra Born, the e-208 provides a more enjoyable driving experience, particularly on twisty roads. Its compact size makes it easier to maneuver in city traffic, while its spacious interior offers comfort for adults. However, it lacks the raw power and sporty handling of the other EVs.

The Peugeot E208’s strengths lie in its refined driving experience and practical features. It's a good option for those prioritizing comfort, stylish design, and a slightly more upscale feel than a standard petrol car.

Visibility is good, though blind spots can be challenging. Handling is manageable in urban environments, though cornering is slightly less precise than with a more sporty car. The 208’s compact size makes it easy to maneuver in tight spaces, but its limited space can be a drawback for families or those needing ample cargo room.

“The Peugeot Traveller offers a substantial and versatile vehicle, presenting a large van-based MPV with a significant amount of space for passengers and cargo. Its design reflects a van’s inherent structure, providing a robust and practical setup. Key features include DAB radio, smartphone connectivity, dual-zone climate control, and a touchscreen infotainment system. Advanced driver-assistance systems like head-up display, reversing camera, and cruise control enhance safety. While the standard equipment is adequate, the Traveller’s considerable size and aerodynamics can lead to increased wind noise.

“The Peugeot 308 SW offers a stylish and practical estate, blending modern design with comfortable interior space. Its sleek exterior, with a large grille and shield, and sharp accents, makes it stand out. The interior boasts a modern iCockpit layout, comfortable seats, and a decent boot. While the rear seats can be cramped for adults, the 608-litre boot is a significant advantage over the Vauxhall Astra Sports Tourer and Volkswagen Golf Estate.

---

Here's a summary of the car review:

The Peugeot e308 SW offers a practical and stylish electric estate car with a focus on efficiency and comfort. Its compact size and clever battery range (248 miles) make it a viable option for families and urban commuters. While the interior design is upscale, it lacks some of the advanced features found in competitors, and the steering feels a bit low to the ground.  The driving experience is comfortable, but it’s less sporty than some electric SUVs.  Its running costs are relatively low, but the slower charging speed and lower power output compared to rivals are drawbacks.

---

“The Peugeot 108 offers a compact and surprisingly enjoyable driving experience, particularly in city conditions. While the engine produces a respectable 72hp, it’s not a powerhouse, and the 62mph reach is relatively quick, though the noise at motorway speeds is noticeable. Steering and handling are responsive and easy to maneuver, but the ride can be a bit bouncy, especially on rough roads. Space is limited, with front seats feeling cramped for adults, and the boot is small. The rear seats fold down, offering a degree of flexibility. Interior styling is functional but lacks the premium feel of competitors. The foldback fabric roof is a welcome addition, adding a touch of style and offering a convertible feel, though it’s a compromise in terms of ease of access and readability.  Overall, the 108 is a practical and economical choice, particularly for city driving, but it falls short of the more refined vehicles in terms of interior quality and driving comfort."

While the rear seat space is somewhat compromised for its size, it’s comparable to the petrol-powered 408 and has a generous 210hp engine. Performance is adequate for everyday driving, though not designed for lap records. The E-408's styling is reminiscent of Picasso's painting, with a sleek, angular design that's less conventionally handsome. It’s a new entry into the coupe SUV market, and Peugeot is showcasing its old traditions with a modern look. While the steering wheel can be a minor concern, the multimedia display and controls are well-designed.”

“The Peugeot E2008 offers a stylish and comfortable electric SUV with a good range and features, though it’s not without its quirks. It’s a popular choice for those seeking a smaller, more premium EV experience, but the infotainment can be a bit clunky. The interior is well-designed and comfortable, but the driving experience isn’t particularly exciting, favoring winding roads over motorway cruising. While the range is decent, it’s slightly lower than some competitors, particularly the Kia and MG models. Overall, the E2008 delivers a pleasant driving experience and a stylish design, making it a strong contender in the small electric SUV segment.”

Here's a summary of the car review:

The BYD Atto 3 is a stylish and practical compact SUV, aiming for a blend of performance and value. It features a modern interior with a unique gym-inspired design, a responsive touchscreen, and features like the rotary door handles and karaoke mode. While the range is adequate, it falls short of the claimed 260 miles, often reaching closer to 200. Battery life is a concern, with slow charging and a limited DC charging speed. The ride is comfortable but can be noisy on the motorway. The Atto 3's steering is light, and while the parking maneuverability is good, the low-slung roof can cause a bit of visual obstruction. The interior design is a mixed bag, with some positive aspects like the comfortable seats and leather, but also noticeable flaws like soft plastic and a slightly angled screen.

“The BYD Sealion 7 offers a spacious and stylish electric SUV with a focus on technology and passenger comfort. Its sleek design features distinctive LED headlights and a curved roofline, creating a modern aesthetic. The interior boasts premium materials and a flowing dashboard, though the steering feels a bit unresponsive. The ride is noticeably unsettled, with bouncing and tyre roar prevalent, and the suspension struggles with bumps. The infotainment system, while feature-rich, is overly reliant on rotating party tricks and lacks intuitive navigation.

Range is a concern; the real-world range estimates are significantly lower than the claimed figures, reflecting the lower battery size. While the motors are smooth, the steering is hyperactive, and the ride is somewhat uncomfortable. While the car's technology is impressive, the materials quality isn’t exceptional.

Alternatives offer better driving dynamics and a more enjoyable experience, while the Sealion 7 provides a comfortable and spacious ride for those prioritizing technology and comfortable seating. It's a worthwhile consideration if you value space and enjoy a modern aesthetic, but be aware of the compromises in driving quality and reliability.”

“The BYD Seal presents a compelling blend of innovative design and practical functionality, aiming to rival established European brands in the electric saloon segment. While boasting a stylish aesthetic and impressive performance, it’s not without its quirks. The steering offers a balanced and responsive feel, enhancing maneuverability, but doesn't quite reach the effortless precision of top-tier vehicles. Acceleration is genuinely impressive, delivering 0-60 mph times exceeding those of many competitors, particularly the Tesla Model 3 Performance. The all-wheel drive system, particularly the Excellence model’s 530hp motor, provides a thrilling driving experience, offering exceptional grip and stability. However, the infotainment system, while functional, is needlessly complex and frustratingly difficult to use, often requiring multiple taps and swipes to access basic functions.  The interior, although well-appointed with quality materials, is dominated by the touchscreen – a particularly problematic feature. It's difficult to navigate and, despite its high-resolution display, frequently displays a barrage of menus, often burying essential controls. The build quality is generally good, with a comfortable interior, but the door design is a bit unconventional.  While the rear seats are adequate for shorter trips, rear passenger space is somewhat limited – particularly for taller passengers. Boot space is decent for its size, but slightly smaller than the Ioniq 6 and Polestar 2, presenting a challenge for larger items.  The ride is generally smooth, absorbing bumps effectively, but it does exhibit a slightly unsettling tendency to jolt on rough roads, necessitating regular brake intervention.  The car’s overall value proposition is appealing. While the initial price is premium, considering battery efficiency and driving prowess, the Seal’s technological advancements, especially in the range and performance, represent a notable upgrade. However, the reliance on a complicated touchscreen interface and the slightly unsettling ride experience mean it isn't a perfect automotive experience.”

“The BYD Seal U offers a compelling blend of value and features, though driving experience is a notable drawback. The hybrid powertrain delivers relatively smooth performance, though the steering feels somewhat heavy and the suspension softens the ride considerably. Visibility is good, and the interior boasts a stylish design with a large touchscreen infotainment system, though the layout isn’t intuitive. While it’s roomy and equipped with advanced safety features, the ride quality suffers from excessive suspension softness and noticeable bumps, requiring careful handling. Practicality is limited, with small boot capacity and slightly awkward storage arrangements. The Seal U presents a decent value proposition for its price, particularly for buyers seeking a compact SUV with a touch of style and technology. However, potential buyers should prioritize driving comfort over spirited performance.”

“The BYD Dolphin boasts impressive features, including a 196265-mile range, efficient battery technology, and a comfortable interior. It offers a range of trim levels, with the Active model prioritizing 95hp and a 211-mile battery. Key features include adjustable vegan leather seats, a 360° surround camera, and a rotary infotainment screen. While the infotainment system can be improved with more shortcuts, the Dolphin offers a neat and stylish design. Safety is prioritized with standard airbags, adaptive cruise control, and blind-spot monitoring.  The rear doors are easy to use, and the boot offers decent space for luggage, though the floor is slightly darker.  Charging speeds are comparable, with the larger battery offering faster charging at 88kW.  Overall, the Dolphin represents a well-equipped and practical electric vehicle option.”

“The Haval Jolion Pro offers a surprisingly conventional SUV design, competing with established brands like the Kia Sportage and Nissan Qashqai. It boasts a large 255-liter boot, though its rear legroom is generous. Powered by a 1.5-litre petrol engine and an electric motor, it delivers 190hp and a claimed 9.0s WLTP figure for 062mph. While the electric motor assists driving, the Jolion’s engine isn’t particularly economical, returning around 40mpg in real-world conditions.  Despite its relatively modest power output, it offers a key feature: direct front wheel power delivery. While styling may offer reassurance, careful consideration of the boot space is crucial, as the Jolion’s size presents challenges for cash flow.”

Here's a summarized version of the car review:

The Ora 03 is a new electric SUV from GWM that offers a unique, funky design, with a compact size and a high-tech interior. It's positioned as a competitor to the Volvo EX30, Smart 1, and MG4, boasting a 10.25-inch display and a range of camera features. The ride is comfortable, but can be a bit jittery on uneven roads. It features advanced driver-assistance systems like adaptive cruise control and parking assist. While the infotainment system is generally well-designed, it can be frustrating to use, with lag and small icons.  The electric range is decent, with a 260-mile official range and a 193-mile practical range, however, charging speeds are slow.  Overall, the Ora 03 is a promising offering, offering a stylish design and a premium interior, but it has some usability and reliability concerns that need addressing.

“The Jaecoo 7 presents a unique blend of style and affordability, offering a compelling value proposition for city dwellers. While the design choices are somewhat derivative, the vehicle’s comfortable interior, well-equipped features, and solid safety ratings make it a worthwhile consideration. Its handling is adequate for urban driving, though the suspension can be noticeably jarring on rough roads. The hybrid powertrain delivers respectable electric range, although the driving experience isn’t exhilarating. The infotainment system, while functional, is initially fiddly to navigate. While the safety features are comprehensive, the driver awareness system is a minor concern.  Overall, the Jaecoo 7 provides a practical and reasonably enjoyable vehicle for its price point.”

“The Leapmotor C10 is a new electric SUV aimed at consumers seeking value and understated design. It distinguishes itself from established brands like Citroen and Stellantis through its compact size and minimalist aesthetic, foregoing a large, recognizable design. It features a flat-topped bar of headlights and mirrored rear lights, a flat side profile, and simple alloy wheels, aligning with a muted color palette. The interior design is largely monochromatic, with a focus on minimal switches and a touchscreen-centric control scheme, though driver information is accessible through a steering wheel interface. Passenger space is generous, offering a wide, flat rear seat. It also includes ISOFIX points and large windows, suggesting a comfortable ride for families. The boot holds 435 liters, while the Renault Scenic ETech offers 545 liters.  The vehicle utilizes a single electric motor and battery combination, producing 218 horsepower and up to 262 miles of range. While competitive in terms of range, its performance falls slightly short of the BYD Atto 3 (440L) and Tesla Model Y (311 miles), highlighting the C10’s focus on value.  It’s a comparatively budget-friendly option compared to the Tesla Model Y, making it a viable alternative for those prioritizing cost-effectiveness."

“The Leapmotor T03 is a compact, budget-friendly electric vehicle offering a stylish and functional experience, despite some minor drawbacks. Its design is distinctive, reminiscent of an anime character, with a tall, narrow body and small wheels, making it suitable for city driving. While it lacks range and handling, the T03 provides a decent driving experience for its segment, particularly in town. It’s surprisingly quick for a compact car, offering a satisfying 95hp, rivaling the Dacia Spring. Space is limited, with a narrow boot and a relatively small interior, but it’s more practical than some alternatives. The driving experience is enjoyable, with responsive steering and comfortable seating, though the lack of Apple CarPlay/Android Auto detracts from the user experience. While the car’s interior is well-equipped, its software is frustrating, with confusing controls and a poorly implemented infotainment system. While its rear doors are narrow, offering a secure and well-balanced space for passengers, the low-speed pedestrian warning sound is a considerable annoyance. Battery range is decent for city driving, with 165 miles of WLTP, but limited on longer journeys. Overall, the Leapmotor T03 presents a compelling option for budget-conscious buyers seeking a stylish and capable city car, though it’s not a top contender in terms of overall driving quality.”

“The Xpeng G6 offers a compelling blend of technology and value, navigating the UK market with a competitive price point. It boasts a smooth ride, intuitive controls, and a long range, positioning it as a strong contender in the electric vehicle segment. The interior design is minimalist, although the front pillars are thick, creating a slightly constrained driving experience. While the steering is disconnected, the G6’s overall composure, combined with its clever tech integration, makes it a worthwhile consideration. The Xpeng G6 offers a comfortable ride, while also delivering impressive acceleration and range. While reliability remains a concern given its relatively recent history, the car's advanced safety features and ample storage space are noteworthy. Whether the G6’s performance matches Tesla’s more engaging driving experience is a matter of preference.”
