mg,mg3,"Is the MG3 a good car? The MG3 used to be a bit of a joke - the old one was the lowest-ranked car on Carwow - but the new model aims to change all that. Now, instead of being antiquated, it’s right up there with the best small cars for performance, efficiency and equipment. Like an air fryer from the middle of Lidl, the MG3’s feature set is as good as any of its alternatives and it’s not immediately clear where the money’s been saved to bring it in at such a low price. Now that it’s a full self-charging hybrid car, the MG3 no longer targets the very cheapest on the market like the Dacia Sandero or Citroen C3 Origin. Instead, it’s more like a cut-price alternative to the Renault Clio E-Tech or Toyota Yaris - a halfway house for people who want the most efficient small car possible, but either don’t want or can’t have a fully electric model. The MG3 won’t win awards for its practicality - it’s not cramped, but it’s no better than average in this regard with a boot that’s about halfway between the Yaris and the Clio in capacity. Rear seat space is moderate, too, though annoyingly the rear seats don’t split when they fold which does limit overall versatility. The front of the cabin looks great, and very modern - in stark contrast to the car it replaces. Poke around and you can find a few places where MG’s saved money - there’s a sliding cover for one of the storage compartments that feels comically flimsy, and the top of the dash and the door cards are made of hard plastic - but the Clio and the Yaris have areas that feel equally cheap. The new MG3 is a transformation from the old model, and instantly becomes one of the best small cars you can buy Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer More importantly, MG’s given the 3 its best touchscreen infotainment system yet, and it’s loaded with equipment - climate control, a digital dashboard, sat-nav and a full suite of assisted driving features are standard on every model. The MG’s hybrid system is brand-new, and puts out an impressive 191hp - versus 140hp for the Clio and up to 130hp for the Yaris. That means it’s easily got any of them beat in a drag race, and makes mincemeat of overtakes or motorway sliproads. It’s not quite as efficient as the alternatives, but you might decide that the additional performance makes the small drop in mpg worthwhile. The real surprise is what happens when you reach a twisty road. The old MG3 was always shockingly good fun in the corners, but unexpectedly MG has managed to repeat the trick. The new MG3 handles brilliantly for a small car, and that makes it one of the most enjoyable small cars to drive. Sound interesting?

mg,zs,"Is the MG ZS a good car? The previous-generation MG ZS was a small SUV that you’d buy because it was cheap - and then spend the rest of your time apologising for it. It was unattractive, thirsty, poor to drive and had a really cheap-feeling interior. However, the second-generation model has had a true Cinderella-style glow-up, and should push the old car right to the back of everybody’s minds - it’s a huge improvement in every way. Based on the same mechanical underpinnings as the excellent MG3 hatchback, the new ZS gets an up-to-date hybrid engine, techy interior and a smart - if not stunning - new look. It’s like trading in your old Nokia for a new smartphone. Probably not the latest Apple iPhone, as MG is still firmly a budget brand - more like one of those off-brand Android phones that gives you lots and lots of bang for your buck. As a small hybrid SUV, there are alternatives to the MG ZS coming from every corner. Some of the best include the Renault Captur, the Hyundai Kona Hybrid, the Peugeot 2008 or the Carwow award-winning Toyota Yaris Cross. MG does things a bit differently to those cars, though. First of all, there’s the way the hybrid system works. It’s far more powerful than any of those alternatives - with 191hp beating out 140hp in the Captur or a measly 115hp in the Yaris Cross. MG’s done this by fitting a more powerful electric motor and a bigger battery, which means that most of the time it drives like an electric car with a petrol generator. However, if you put your foot down both power sources will give their all, making this quite a rapid little SUV. The ZS undercuts almost every alternative on price while offering loads of space and a powerful engine - but you may want to pay a little extra for a more polished ownership experience Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The comparison is also pretty favourable when it comes to interior space. The ZS has enough room for a six-foot adult to sit behind a driver of the same size in comfort, which means it’s also great for child seats or lanky teenagers. The 443-litre boot is also bigger than the hybrid Renault Captur or the Toyota Yaris Cross, and only marginally smaller than the Hyundai Kona hybrid. It’s in the cabin where you notice evidence of MG’s cost-cutting, though - there are plenty of low-rent material choices, and infotainment software that despite being a huge improvement on the old ZS isn’t as easy to use or as intuitive as the best systems out there. You do get loads of equipment, though. The top-spec Trophy model is still inexpensive but comes with climate control, sat-nav, smartphone connectivity, leather upholstery and a full suite of driver assistance tech including the semi-autonomous MG Pilot system. To drive, it’s another huge leap from the old car, which was pretty dire on the road. The ZS isn’t as satisfying to drive as a Renault Captur or Toyota Yaris Cross, despite its superior power output - but it has light controls and good visibility, making it great around town. Only poor refinement on the motorway and quite crashy suspension let the side down. If lots of power and equipment for a low price capture your imagination, check out our best MG ZS deals right here.

mg,zs-ev,"Is the MG ZS EV a good car? The MG ZS EV is an electric SUV that goes up against the likes of the Hyundai Kona Electric and Kia Niro EV – both of which are now well-established options at the affordable end of the electric car market. It’s a bit like going for a pair of cheap Bluetooth headphones. It might not be from the obvious choice of brands, but it promises to do a similar job at a lower cost. Since its revival as a mass-production manufacturer, MG’s models haven’t been the most exciting to look at. The new ZS EV is in a similar vein, but this updated version now comes with a blanked-out grille and LED headlights as part of a tweaked front end. There is also a new rear bumper with altered lights. MG has also improved the interior design, with the main addition being a new 10.1-inch infotainment touchscreen that has updated software to make it much smoother than before. A 7.0-inch driver display has also been added that offers efficiency and safety information. But where alternatives may offer slightly more comfort and refinement, you’ll find a lot of scratchy plastics alongside the new carbon fibre-effect upholstery finish on the dashboard and leather trim on the seats. In the back, you have decent legroom behind even the tallest of drivers. But as the batteries are mounted under the floor, your knees end up quite high. Headroom is also not the best, with the panoramic sunroof on Trophy models eating into the space even more. Taller passengers may struggle to get comfortable in the back. With an adjustable boot floor as standard, you get 470 litres. This is on par with the Kia Niro EV's 475 litres, but is 140 litres more than the Hyundai Kona Electric's offering. Folding the seats down creates a 1,100-litre space, but the seats don’t quite fold flat. Although refinement and overall quality aren’t the best, the ZS EV is more than capable of being a practical option Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The ZS EV comes with two battery options. The 51kWh Standard Range and 72kWh Long Range options offer up to 198 and 273 miles respectively. When driving in the real world across multiple conditions and in all three driving modes – Eco, Normal and Sport – you get closer to 240 miles. But leave it in Normal mode and you’ll get nearer to the claimed figure. Around town, the steering feels light and accurate. It also doesn’t allow many bumps into the cabin at slow speeds, with the suspension setup in normal mode helping it out. On the motorway, you’ll notice a lot of tyre noise and, if you go for the top-spec Trophy version, the roof rails do make a slight whistling noise. It feels comfortable on the whole, but the seats don’t have as much cushioning or support as you might like. When applying Sport mode and tackling a country road, the ZS feels pretty stable. It isn’t the most engaging car in the world and it can scrabble for grip in damper conditions – but for most that won’t be much of an issue. With its competitive pricing and practicality, the ZS EV is a model you should consider. It may not be as refined as alternatives, but it can certainly be a useful option if you’re in the market for an efficient SUV.

mg,hs,"Is the MG HS a good car? The MG HS has at points been the best-selling car in the UK and it’s easy to see why. It’s a big, practical family SUV with a posh-looking interior, loads of standard equipment and a headline-grabbing plug-in hybrid engine option - but it costs about as much as most small hatchbacks. While the old HS was definitely in the ‘cheap but not very cheerful’ category, the new model actually feels like something you wouldn’t mind driving around - it has redeeming features other than its price tag. It’s a bit like a Harvester - nobody’s ever going to look at it as a high-end option, but if you’re looking to feed the whole family on a budget, it’s tasty enough that you don’t feel punished for your penny-pinching. The HS is a similar size to family SUVs such as the Ford Kuga, Kia Sportage and Nissan Qashqai - but with its low price tag, you might consider it on the same shortlist as much smaller SUVs such as the Volkswagen T-Cross or Ford Puma. Two more direct alternatives are the Citroen C5 Aircross or BYD Seal U - both big SUVs that put affordability first, and have plug-in hybrid engines available. If your main concern is space for the money, the MG HS is a great option. Despite a price tag close to something like a Volkswagen Polo hatchback, it has space in the back for a six-foot adult to stretch out, plus a 507-litre boot that’ll accommodate the whole family’s kit and clobber. Still remarkably cheap but now much more capable - the MG HS is now a car I could recommend for more than just its price tag Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer You also get a dashboard that looks pretty posh, with a dual-screen setup just like you get on a BMW X3. You don’t have to press very far to find out where MG’s saved money, though, and materials and build quality aren’t really up to the standards of more expensive cars. It’s also not the easiest to use, with very few physical switches, an awkward touchscreen interface and not much storage for smaller items. As far as engines go, there’s a choice of two. You can have a bog-standard petrol, available with manual or automatic gearboxes - these are the more affordable options, and though they’re not particularly offensive to drive they are a bit thirsty. The headline-grabber is the HS plug-in hybrid, which can do up to 75 miles on a charge. That figure is up there with the best PHEVs on sale, and it gives you tons of flexibility - it’s enough to do even the longest of commutes without troubling the petrol engine once. It also nudges the HS into the lowest-but-one band for Benefit-in-Kind tax, making it hundreds of pounds a month cheaper than the equivalent Kia Sportage or Ford Kuga for company car drivers. Both of those cars are better to drive, mind you - they steer more sweetly and handle bumps better, as well as being more responsive and reassuring in the corners. The gap is narrower if you’re just cruising round town or on the motorway, though, where the HS is impressively refined and difficult to dislike. If the new MG HS seems like the SUV for you, check out our best MG HS deals on Carwow. You can see our other MG deals here, or search for a used MG for sale here. And remember, Carwow can even help you sell your old car.",Carwow
mg,mg-4,"Is the MG4 EV a good car? MG pulled an absolute blinder with the MG4, and much like the lovable underdog in a boxing movie it punches well above its weight division. It’s more affordable than alternatives such as the Renault Megane E-Tech and Cupra Born, costing around the same as the smaller Vauxhall Corsa Electric and Fiat 500e. You’d be forgiven for thinking that MG have taken a ‘cheap and cheerful’ approach to engineering the MG4, but that’s far from the truth. So far from it, in fact, that the MG4 received high commendations in the 2024 Carwow Car of the Year Awards’ Outstanding EV and Urban Living categories. Just look at it, a mix of pointy details, sharp creases and funky shapes such as the lower body cladding and split roof spoiler. It’s a refreshing looking thing; it still stands out against newer MGs such as the MG S5 and MG HS as much as it does its alternatives. MG4 EV: electric range, battery and charging data Range: 218-331 milesEfficiency: 3.6-3.8 miles per kWhBattery size: 51kWh / 62kWh / 74kWhMax charge speed: 150kWCharge time AC: 6hrs 12mins, 10-100%, 7kW / 7hrs 30mins, 10-100%, 7kW / 9hrs, 10-100%, 7kWCharge time DC: 39mins, 10-80%, 150kW / 35mins, 10-80%, 150kWCharge port location: Left rearPower outputs: 170hp / 204hp / 245hp It’s a shame the interior isn’t quite as novel, with a dashboard layout that’s so simple it verges on boring, but the material quality, fit and finish and standard kit is better than you might expect for the price. A 10.25-inch infotainment display comes as standard on all trim levels of the MG4, and though it comes with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, MG’s own software is rather basic. It’s frustrating to operate too, especially on the move, with too many menus to navigate. There’s plenty of room in the MG4 though; plenty of adjustability for you to get comfy behind the wheel and enough head and leg room for tall passengers in the rear - though it’s a bit of a squeeze when you’ve got three in the back. The 363-litre boot capacity trails the Volkswagen ID3 for space, and puts it well behind the Megane E-Tech. The MG4 comes with two battery options, offering 218 claimed miles of range in its most basic trim through to 323 miles for the Trophy Extended Range model. The top-rung MG4 XPower, which we’ve reviewed separately, offers a big power hike over the rest of the trim levels, but makes do with a 239-mile range. MG has fully injected its own personality into the MG4 EV, and it leaves you wanting to get to know it a lot more… Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Around town the MG4 is easy to potter about in thanks to its light steering, peppy electric motors and most importantly, its comfortable suspension. It takes potholes, speed bumps and cracked roads in its stride, and the same applies to motorways where the MG4 just soaks up the miles with ease. Yet even with its soft suspension the MG4 is rather fun to drive on a twisty road, feeling agile and grippy with little in the way of body lean. The X-Power is particularly rapid, but it’s different enough that we've reviewed it separately here. For a stonking value for money proposition, have a look at our new MG4 deals as well as our MG4 lease deals. You can also check out used MG4s from our network of trusted dealers as well as other used MGs. When it’s time for a change, you can even sell your current car through Carwow.",Carwow
mg,s5-ev,"Is the MG S5 EV a good car? The MG S5 is the sequel to the MG ZS EV - it’s a compact, all-electric SUV, and like the rest of MG’s range majors on value-for-money - putting it right in the firing line of really excellent electric cars such as the Volvo EX30, Kia EV3 and Skoda Elroq. It’s also the first MG we’ve reviewed that doesn’t really have any caveats - no ‘it’s great for this, but…’ modifiers need to be added. While that does mean it’s not quite as standout as MG’s other cars, like the cheap-as-chips MG 4 or the BIK champion MG HS, it also means that it’s easier to recommend for more people. It’s like a chef who starts their career out with wild and divisive combinations like salmon teacakes with a candyfloss mousse, but matures into making a really solid sea bass with risotto. Like some of the most reliable dishes, the new S5 EV doesn’t exactly shout about its prowess. The styling is the first thing to get past - or the lack of styling, you could say. The S5 EV looks as though MG’s design team started with a normal SUV and then Photoshopped out any of its distinguishing features. While this definitely means it blends into the crowd, you’ll have to be a really magnolia kind of person to be excited by its featureless front end or lower grille ‘inspired’ by the Cyberster sports car. MG S5 EV: electric range, battery and charging data Range: 211 - 298 milesEfficiency: 4.3 - 4.7 mi/kWhBattery size: 49kWh/64kWhMax charge speed: 120kW/139kWCharge time AC: 7hrs / 9hrs 15m @ 7kWCharge time DC: 24min / 28min 10-80%Charge port location: Left rearPower outputs: 170hp / 228hp Things start to look up when you get inside, though. The S5 EV has MG’s best interior to date. Just about everything you touch is covered in soft-touch material, and you really have to look quite hard to find any cheap, nasty plastics - that’s not something you could say about the MG 4, which shares its underpinnings with the S5 EV. Better yet, MG’s listened to feedback from reviewers and journalists, and implemented a few features to make life just that little bit easier. There are physical climate controls underneath the screen so you don’t have to go rootling round in touchscreen menus just to change the temperature, and there’s an easy shortcut to switch off the more annoying driver assistance features too. The MG S5 EV isn't exactly eye-catching, but it offers a really impressive combination of space and equipment for the money Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The S5 EV is great for families as well, as it has bags of rear legroom and a 453-litre boot - nearly matching the roomy Kia EV3. There are two models available - a Standard Range car that can do up to 211 miles on a charge and a Long Range variant which claims up to 298 miles of range. It’s a shame MG has no plans to introduce an Extended Range model, as that could really take the fight to the Kia EV3 which has up to 375 miles of range. So behind the dull looks, the MG S5 EV is really quite a good electric car indeed. If you’re interested, you could check out our best MG S5 EV deals here, or find a great MG S5 leasing offer.

mg,4-xpower,"Is the MG4 XPower a good car? This is the MG4 XPower, and it’s a bit like a supermarket's own-brand vindaloo – packing plenty of heat at a value price. It’s a car you’d consider if you’ve been waiting for the dawn of the electric hot hatch, but the higher-power variants of the Cupra Born or Volkswagen ID3 just don’t offer enough punch for you. Not that the looks of the XPower would suggest it’s the exciting version – not a great deal of change has been made over the base MG4. Orange brake callipers and new 18-inch wheels give the game away if you know what you’re looking for, as do a few polished trim pieces, but the bodywork is otherwise untouched. The stealthy vibe may appeal, but there’s a case to be made that MG could and should have done more to shout about the car’s performance. Similarly, there’s very little difference inside compared with the standard MG4. Aside from some Alcantara seat and door inserts, as well as a touch of red stitching, there’s nothing to scream XPower here. Material quality continues to impress for the price, but a dull selection of colours and a basic design does nothing to add to the excitement the car’s power promises. Drag race: Lamborghini Gallardo v MG4 XPower v Nissan GT-R Also retained for the XPower is the 10.25-inch infotainment system, packed with sat nav along with support for Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. A few welcome quality-of-life improvements have been made to the software, as well as a basic ‘Track Mode’ app that gives you real-time access to G-force and acceleration data. As with the base MG4, rear passenger space is impressive, with a decent amount of head and legroom even for taller adults. Boot space is also untouched at 363 litres, which is marginally behind the Volkswagen ID3’s 385 litres. The big changes for the MG4 XPower lie under the skin. As well as more power for the rear motor, a second motor has been added to the front axle too, combining to produce 435hp and 600Nm of torque. The result is 0-60mph in a mind-boggling 3.8 seconds (for context, that’s quicker than a Porsche 911 Carrera 4) and an increased top speed of 124mph. It’s not just the off-the-line performance that’s so impressive either, with a real gut-punching kick from 30-70mph too. To help cope with that extra power, MG has made some mechanical tweaks as well. An electronic locking differential has been added alongside a torque vectoring system, which combine to manage how power is distributed to the wheels through corners. The suspension is the same as the base MG4, though with new tuning for the springs and dampers. MG has made the 'Volkswagen ID3 R' that never was. This is a hauntingly fast EV, but it’s not one to excite you outside of a straight-line sprint Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Though the result is a car that’s certainly capable when you throw it through the bends, it’s not particularly involving. Dull steering makes it difficult to feel how much grip the front wheels have, and even the mechanical upgrades can’t hide the fact this is quite a heavy car. You may outrun a Honda Civic Type R or Hyundai i30 N, but you won’t have as much fun in the twisty stuff. On top of that, because of the suspension tweaks, the MG4 XPower crashes over bumps in the road more so than the regular car, though otherwise remains pretty comfortable around town. At motorway speeds though, you do really notice the wind noise as well as a slight whine from the new front motor. Official range figures from the 64kWh battery dip from 270 miles in the Long Range car to 239 miles for this sporty XPower model. A mixed driving route with the car for this test returned 2.9 miles/kWh, equating to around 185 miles of real-world range. For stomach-churning, sports-car troubling performance at a value price, the MG4 XPower delivers big. That said, traditional hot hatch buyers may struggle to be won over by quite a muted driving experience beyond the numbers. Looking to make this electric hot hatch your next car?

mg,gs,"Is the MG GS a good car? The MG GS is a medium-sized family SUV that’s a little larger than the likes of the Nissan Qashqai and Renault Kadjar, yet costs a little less. Unfortunately, some of the MG’s penny-pinching is all too obvious, such as the brittle interior plastics and second-rate infotainment system. From the outside, the MG GS looks more like a jacked-up hatchback than most family SUVs. It sports all the black plastic bumper trims you’d expect of a chunky pseudo-off-roader, but the MG GS’ curvy bumpers, slim brake lights and raked roofline look sportier than the comparatively boxy Kia Sportage and Hyundai Tucson. Unfortunately, the MG GS’ interesting exterior only serves to show how dull and drab its interior is. It’s neatly laid out and all the buttons are grouped together so they’re easy to reach, but almost every surface comes with a hard plastic finish and the optional brushed-metal effect trims don’t feel anywhere near as robust as they look. You can have contrasting inserts fitted to the dashboard and doors, but these do little to spruce up the GS’ interior. Equally middling is the touchscreen infotainment system. It’s easy to read but nowhere near as intuitive as the systems you get in most alternatives. What it loses out in technology, the GS claws back (albeit only slightly) in terms of practicality. There’s just as much room in the front seats as you get in the likes of the Nissan Qashqai and there’s more space for carrying three adults at once in the back. The MG GS might appeal if you’re looking for something practical and likely to stand out, but it isn’t particularly good to drive and doesn’t feel as well built as most other family SUVs. Mat Watson Carwow expert It’s a similar story when you need to load the MG GS’ boot. It’s bigger than the Nissan’s and there’s no load lip which makes it easy to slide in heavy boxes. You can fold the back seats down if you need to carry seriously bulky stuff, such as a bike. It’s a shame you can’t get the MG GS with a diesel engine to help you carry very heavy luggage or tow a trailer, though. Instead, it comes with a 1.5-litre 166hp petrol unit. At least it feels fairly spritely and trundles along at motorway speeds relatively quietly – if not particularly economically. Head off the motorway and you’ll find the MG GS doesn’t feel particularly relaxing to drive. Its suspension is firmer than in the likes of the Nissan Qashqai so you’ll feel more of a thud each time you hit a pothole around town. At least you get a decent view out and the optional automatic gearbox you can get in top-spec models means you don’t have to make endless gear changes in heavy traffic. Unlike most SUVs, you can’t get the GS with automatic emergency braking, lane-keeping assistance or driver tiredness detection. As a result, you’ll be better off looking elsewhere if safety is your number one priority. But, if you’re after a sporty-looking yet practical SUV on a shoestring budget, it could be worth a look.

mg,5,"Is the MG5 EV a good car? This is the MG5 EV, and it’s one of very few electric estate cars currently available in the UK – the others being the Porsche Taycan Sport Turismo, Vauxhall Astra Sports Tourer Electric and Peugeot e-308 SW. It’s a bit like doing your shopping at Lidl or Aldi. On the face of things, you may dismiss the MG5 as simply being a value option - but if you’re clued up, you’ll know there’s much more to it than that. The MG5 was given a design overhaul in 2022 and it was much-needed, though it also came with a small bump in price. The dowdy car of old has been replaced with a stylish new look, sporting sharp lines in the bumpers and wide, narrow headlights. It’s not quite as striking as the Carwow 2023 Car of the Year, the MG4 hatch, though. On the inside, the MG5 isn’t quite as smart either, but it’s a definite improvement over the pre-revision car. Build quality is really good and there’s a respectable amount of plush-feeling materials. Fabric seats come as standard, though range-topping models get a leatherette set. Sitting at the heart of the dashboard is an updated 10.25-inch infotainment system. It’s certainly a leap from the older, sluggish screen and, if you’d rather mirror your smartphone, it comes with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay as standard. It does retain a part-digital, part-analogue driver’s display, though this feels pretty clunky and would work better as a fully digital unit. Updates have made the MG5 EV much more attractive, but it’s a shame a little price rise came too Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer There’s lots of knee and headroom in the back seats of the MG5, however a raised footwell does leave your rear passengers angled rather awkwardly. As for boot space, you’ve got 580 litres to work with in the MG5. That’s only slightly down on the Toyota Corolla Touring Sports’ 598 litres, so it’s a useful space that will easily carry large suitcases. Choosing the motor and battery is easy, because, well, there is no choice. Whichever MG5 trim you choose you get a battery with a usable capacity of 57kWh and a 156hp motor. That said, driving range is 250 miles in the entry-level SE version or 235 miles in the higher-spec Trophy model, thanks largely to the bigger alloy wheels. The MG5 is comfortable in town and on the motorway, and you get the MG Pilot safety system as standard, which includes assistance kit such as adaptive cruise control and lane-keep assist. If you like the sound of the MG5 EV you can check out the latest new deals now or browse used stock from dealers near you. You can also take a look at other used MG models.

byd,dolphin,"Is the BYD Dolphin a good car? The BYD Dolphin is a mid-sized electric car bringing good levels of equipment and decent practicality, as well as a low starting price – all attributes that make it highly attractive if you're in the market for an EV and you don't want an SUV. Chinese brand BYD launched in the UK with the Atto 3 SUV, and its second model, also all-electric, is the Dolphin. Think of it as a pocket telescope - not impressive in size, but its compact dimensions belie its abilities to show users more than they bargained for. For example, the entry car’s price undercuts potential alternatives such as the MG 4, and significantly undercuts the likes of the Cupra Born, VW ID3 and Smart #1, as well as the smaller Renault Zoe and Peugeot e-208. But equipment levels impress, with kit including electrically adjustable vegan leather seats, a 360-degree surround camera and 12.8-inch rotatable screen all standard on even the entry car. But only the cars over £30,000 get the longer-range battery. And yep, rotatable. At the touch of a button, as long as you’re not using the landscape-only Apple CarPlay/Android Auto, the big infotainment screen will switch from landscape to portrait or back again. Most people will pick a layout and stick with it, but a neat party trick nonetheless. BYD Dolphin: electric range, battery and charging data Range: 196-265 milesEfficiency: 3.9-4.1mi/kWhBattery size: 45kWh / 60kWhMax charge speed: 150kWCharge time AC: 5hrs, 0-100%, 11kW / 6hrs 12mins, 0-100%, 11kWCharge time DC: 40mins, 10-80%, 150kWCharge port location: Right side frontPower outputs: 95hp / 177hp / 204hp The Dolphin comes in four different trim levels, only two of which offer the same battery, power, range and charging stats. At the bottom is the Active which has 95hp and a 211-mile range, while the top-spec Design has 204hp and 265 miles of range. We’ll go into more detail on the different options later on, and the two lower-price cars aren't available until a couple of months after launch. Once past the slightly odd name, the Dolphin has a subtly inoffensive style to it; nothing likely to court car park controversy, but it’s neat enough. On the inside, there is plenty to catch the eye, from the rounded set of switches below the screen that also house the gear selector, to the sweeping air vent surrounds that form part of a dynamic line across the dashboard. Rear seat space is surprisingly good for a car that doesn’t have a big footprint, with taller adults easily able to get comfortable one behind the other. That’s helped by the flat floor – a result of clever battery packaging – and the fact that you can get your feet just about under the front seats. Three rear passengers will be a squeeze though, which isn’t a big surprise in a fairly compact hatchback. Be aware that the bigger battery is only available with the more expensive Dolphin models - the more affordable ones are comparatively down on range Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Boot space is reasonable, and there’s a handy removable rubber mat to keep wet dogs or muddy boots off the carpeted moveable boot floor. It’s a deep space when set in the lower position, and offers a little more room that a Smart #1, Renault Zoe or MG 4, although not quite as much as a Volkswagen ID3 or Cupra Born. To drive, the most powerful of the three power options is a little too powerful for the tyres, especially in the wet where they have a tendency to easily spin the wheels. BYD has acknowledged they’re not perfect, and will be changing the tyres it fits to the Dolphin for cars built from November 2023. Otherwise it’s a pleasant and relaxed experience, although the car doesn’t always smooth itself over urban bumps. But it’s grown-up enough to settle in fine on longer runs, and the light steering is welcome for low-speed manoeuvring, although at higher speeds the standard setting is too light for engaging or spirited driving. It can be altered in the menus though, which helps. Much like the Fiat 500e, the Dolphin’s smaller battery should be ignored by anyone venturing far from home. The lower range is fine for urban jaunts, but the extra capacity of the bigger battery provides significant peace of mind. The Dolphin looks neat and tidy without breaking any new ground styling-wise, and is a well-rounded, well-equipped and practical car that opens up the electric hatchback choices even further.

byd,seal-u,"Is the BYD Seal U a good car? It’s not immediately obvious what sort of car the BYD Seal U is from the name alone - it sounds like it should be related to the all-electric BYD Seal saloon. However, it’s instead a plug-in hybrid family-sized SUV which majors on value - coming in comfortably cheaper than many much smaller hatchbacks and SUVs. It’s also quite a frustrating car, as it doesn’t do things by halves. In some aspects it’s good - very good, arguably near the top of its class. In others, however, it’s firmly near the bottom, making it difficult to recommend. It’s like buying products from Temu or Aliexpress - they can be very good or very bad, but rarely are they just average. The Seal U is a similar size to plug-in hybrid SUVs such as the Hyundai Tucson, Ford Kuga and Volkswagen Tiguan, but it’s closer in price to cars such as the Kia Niro or Jeep Renegade, both of which are a lot smaller. The closest alternative is the MG HS, which comes in at a similar size and a similar price for its plug-in hybrid variant. The BYD Seal U starts on the back foot because of its design. Whereas BYD’s other cars are at least distinctive if not particularly pretty, the Seal U looks like every other SUV was popped into a blender. It’s so anonymous that it would make the perfect getaway car, but the result is that you don’t feel particularly proud or excited to be climbing aboard. At least you’ll have plenty of room inside. Space in the front and rear seats is excellent, with space for a six-foot passenger to stretch out behind a driver of a similar size. The boot isn’t quite so impressive, at 425 litres in capacity - most alternatives offer more room. It’s still a useful space, though, as it’s deep and wide - just not very tall. The BYD Seal U really isn’t good to drive, but it’s so affordable and decently practical it’s difficult to complain too much Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Those sat up front enjoy loads of tech as standard, and a cabin design that’s rather more distinctive than the exterior styling. You get BYD’s trademark rotating touchscreen infotainment system - 15.6-inches across, it’s huge, clear and responsive, even if the interface doesn’t always make the most sense. Other luxurious features include things like full-cabin air purification, which senses when there are lots of pollutants outside (or even inside) the vehicle and can filter them out. It’s driving the Seal U which highlights its Marmite nature more than anything else. The hybrid powertrain is truly excellent, but the rest of the driving experience is very poor. The Seal U runs on its electric motors most of the time, with the petrol engine acting mostly as a generator and only kicking in fully if you put your foot all the way down. That means progress is smooth, if not hugely rapid, and makes the Seal U fantastic for driving around town. Good range on a charge and a generally quiet cabin free of too much wind and road noise further this aspect. But the Seal U’s suspension is so soft that it wallows over bumps like a ship in rough seas, and the steering is so light that it feels as if you’re driving a remote controlled-car. This is especially a shame given that the Seal saloon with which the Seal U (sort of) shares a name is really good to drive.

byd,atto-3,"Is the BYD Atto 3 a good car? Another day and another family-oriented electric SUV to bring you. This is the BYD Atto 3, fresh from China, and aiming to find a place on your shortlist if you’re looking at cars like the Peugeot e-2008, MG ZS EV or Kia Niro EV. Like discovering after a few years working together that you went to school with your colleague on the desk across from you, the BYD Atto 3 may be more familiar than you realise. BYD has been manufacturing everything from smartphone components to electric buses since its inception in 1995, and recently has been selling cars in its home market. Now, it wants a slice of the UK pie. At first glance though, it’s not doing too much to stand out. Though its design is inoffensive (‘Build Your Dreams’ badging aside), there’s little about the car that’ll turn your head away from the plethora of choices you have in this segment. Fortunately, the same can’t be said for the eccentric interior. Be it the muscle membrane-like trim inserts, eye-catching vegan leather colour combination or the (functional) guitar strings across the door bins, there’s no accusing the Atto 3 of lacking character inside. BYD Atto 3: electric range, battery and charging data Range: 261 milesEfficiency: 4.0 miles per kWhBattery size: 60kWhMax charge speed: 150kWCharge time AC: 9hrs 42mins, 0-100%, 7kWCharge time DC: 44mins, 10-80%, 150kWCharge port location: Right frontPower outputs: 204hp Better still, build quality is impressive, as you’ll be hard-pressed to find cheap-feeling materials (unless you look way under the dashboard) – a rarity nowadays on more affordable cars. A 12.8-inch infotainment system comes as standard, with a 15.6-inch screen fitted to top-spec Design models. There’s a bit of a party trick to it too, as it’s able to rotate from landscape to portrait at the press of a button. Amusing for a brief moment, though you’ll likely find a preference quickly and leave it untouched. The software on the system itself is pretty intuitive – it’s essentially just an Android tablet. There are some teething issues to solve, though. You do get Apple CarPlay, but there's no Android Auto yet – said to be coming as a no-cost update sometime in the future – and the ‘Hey BYD’ voice assistant adapting to some of the UK’s more regional accents would be welcome. Legroom in the rear of the BYD Atto 3 is decent, though you may be left wanting more headroom. Kids in car seats will be fine, but it’s something to consider if you’re ferrying teenagers or adults around often. It’s a similar story for boot space, too; 440 litres of storage isn’t woeful, but it’s beaten by the Kia Niro EV and MG ZS EV, although it is marginally better than the similarly-sized Peugeot e-2008. The BYD Atto 3 has a quirky interior design – it's smart, but the guitar strings on the doors are just odd Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer All versions of the BYD Atto 3 are powered by a single electric motor, drawing power from a 60.5kWh battery. Official testing has its range at 260 miles, though a cold March day of driving the car in mixed conditions returned 3.3mi/kWh, equating to less than 200 miles of real-world range. If you’re planning to use your Atto 3 as an urban runaround, you’ll be happy to know it’s pleasant to use around town. Visibility is good all-round, and a standard-fit 360-degree camera is a nice addition for parking. Supple suspension results in a comfy ride over bumps in the road, too. That translates nicely out on the motorway as well, though prepare yourself for a lot of wind noise at higher speeds. On a back road, the BYD Atto 3 will wobble around a bit and doesn’t offer much in the way of excitement, but that’s hardly a dealbreaker for cars like this. For a first foray into the UK market, the BYD Atto 3 is a respectable effort. It offers the value and quality to seriously consider compared with the established names, though it lacks some of the polish you find from more familiar brands and that lack of space may prove a sticking point.

byd,seal,"Is the BYD Seal a good car? The BYD Seal is a bit like the kid who joins the school halfway through Year 11 and yet finishes the year as rugby captain, prefect and top of the exam tables. You see, while BYD has only been selling cars in the UK since summer 2023, the Seal is an electric saloon car that displays maturity and ability that you’d expect from a highly established European manufacturer. In fact, in many ways it’s actually an improvement on the Tesla Model 3 and Hyundai Ioniq 6 which constitute its two closest alternatives. Other electric cars you might consider are the Polestar 2 and BMW i4. While BYD may have launched the Sealion 7 and Seal U in the years since, the Seal is still a better car than either. Ignore the slightly odd naming convention for a while, though, and focus for a second on the styling - which is great. The Seal is a similar shape to the Tesla Model 3, being a saloon car with a dropped snout and rounded roofline - but it has more intricate detailing around the headlights and a neat lightbar at the rear. It’s a bit less anonymous than the Tesla without being too glam. On the inside, though, it’s like BYD’s stylists took one look at Tesla’s minimalist approach and simply said ‘no, thank you’. The dashboard is very distinctive as a result, with air vents that seamlessly mould into full-width panels running across the cabin. There are posh quilted seats and a panel of switchgear in the centre. It all feels quite upmarket, if unconventional. BYD Seal: electric range, battery and charging data Range: 323-354 milesEfficiency: 3.4-3.7mi/kWhBattery size: 83kWh Max charge speed: 150kWCharge time DC: 37mins, 10-80%, 150kWCharge port location: Right side rearPower outputs: 313hp / 530hp Even more unconventional is the infotainment screen, which is a huge 15.6-inches across. BYD’s party piece is that the screen physically rotates from portrait to landscape at the touch of a button. The company says this is because things like the sat-nav are better in portrait mode, but as the standard-fit Apple CarPlay and Android Auto only works in landscape you’ll probably leave the rotating trick as a once-in-a-blue-moon showoff rather than a regular feature. The interface isn’t quite as good as you get in a Model 3 or Ioniq 6, either. The BYD Seal’s screen is bright, clear and responsive, but common functions are buried just a few menus too deep with buttons that are too hard to hit on the move. Drivers and front passengers of all sizes will be able to get comfy up front in those squashy, quilted leather seats, and there’s good stowage for smaller items too. The back seats are a bit more of a squeeze, with decent legroom but headroom that’s limited by the huge panoramic glass roof. There’s a lot to like about the Seal, but it’s a shame so many functions go through the touchscreen that’s too hard to use while driving Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Boot space of 402 litres matches the Ioniq 6 but trails the Model 3. There is a handy front boot for storing charge cables, though. Just note that, as a saloon car, the Seal isn’t as practical for large items as a Polestar 2. To drive, the Seal is deeply impressive. Even the standard rear-wheel drive model is quick, but performance from the all-wheel drive, 530hp Excellence version is mind-bending and, unlike a Tesla, totally repeatable. Responsive and accurate steering, plus suspension that strikes a great balance between comfort and cornering, means it’s even a good amount of fun on a twisty road. Competitive range figures of 323 - 354 miles are the icing on the cake, though it’s a shame there’s no super-long range version to challenge the best Tesla Model 3. Still, the BYD Seal is a car that should definitely be on your shortlist. Interested? Check out our best BYD Seal deals here, or get a great price on a BYD Seal lease.

byd,sealion-7,"Is the BYD Sealion 7 a good car? The BYD Sealion 7 is a roomy electric SUV with sporty looks, impressive specs and a very reasonable price tag - on paper, a brilliant alternative to electric vehicles such as the Tesla Model Y, Kia EV6 or Peugeot E-3008. BYD’s models can be a bit hit and miss, though. The Seal and Dolphin are really good electric cars, but the Seal U plug-in hybrid SUV is rather disappointing. The Sealion 7 is a mixed bag - it's not as outwardly brilliant as the Seal, but it's far better than the Seal U and a credible alternative to the aforementioned Tesla. The Sealion 7 gets off to a reasonable start because while it’s not exactly handsome, it’s a bit less anonymous than the Seal U. BYD’s signature headlight design features C-shape LEDs, sat above a chunky bumper design with big air intakes. A sleek, sloping roofline trails rearward to a tailgate spoiler and a full-width rear lightbar. Inside, things are a bit less lukewarm - it’s genuinely nice inside, with posh-feeling materials swaddling every surface and an interesting dashboard design covered in flowing lines. There’s a huge 15.6-inch infotainment screen with BYD’s trademark rotating party trick - this is cool the first few times, but is likely to be relegated to gimmick status after you’ve shown your mates. BYD Sealion 7: electric range, battery and charging data Range: 283-312 milesBattery size: 82.5kWh / 91.3kWhMax charge speed: 150kW / 230kWCharge time DC: 32mins, 10-80%, 150kW / 24mins, 10-80%, 230kWCharge port location: Right side rearPower outputs: 313hp / 530hp There are some materials that feel a little bit cheap considering that the Sealion 7 isn’t a budget machine, but overall it feels quite premium - even if it’s lacking the wow factor of a Peugeot E-3008. No such caveats when it comes to the space on offer, though. The front seats are big, squashy and comfortable, and the storage solutions for smaller items are useful - but the back seats are huge, so rear passengers will be able to stretch out as much as they’d like. You won’t have any issues fitting lanky teens or bulky child seats back here, though the middle seat backrest is quite uncomfortable so it’s certainly better for two people. At 520 litres in capacity, boot space can’t hold a candle to the Tesla Model Y but it’s pretty good compared with most other alternatives. There’s a deep underfloor storage compartment and even a useful ‘frunk’ where you’d find the engine on a combustion-powered car. If you’re looking for lots of space in the cabin, the BYD Sealion 7 could be appealing, but it’s far from best-in-class in most other areas… Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The Sealion 7 offers a choice of two large battery packs, with a claimed range of between 283-312 miles. That sounds good on paper, but during our testing we saw really poor efficiency which would suggest that even the larger battery will only return a figure in the 200s. Not so good. It is powerful, though, and the motors are smooth and silent, so getting up to speed on the motorway is easy. It’s a shame that the rest of the car isn’t quite as refined - there’s a lot of wind noise and tyre roar. Worse still, the Sealion 7’s suspension feels very unsettled. It bounces a lot over bumps, and you can feel the body moving long after you've passed a road imperfection. It’s like being in a rather unstable ship at sea. On top of this, twitchy and hyperactive steering means it’s not even much fun to drive down a twisting B-road, which is a shame. The Sealion 7 is an interesting left-field choice if you value technology and passenger space, but the alternatives all have more enticing driving dynamics and better range, for less cash.

volkswagen,touareg,"Is the Volkswagen Touareg a good car? The Volkswagen Touareg may not have quite the badge cachet of the Audi Q7 and Mercedes GLE, but nevertheless, it’s a big, spacious, high-tech SUV that’s also very comfortable. Think of the Touareg, then, as Waitrose rather than Harrods Food Hall. It’s easily posh enough for the majority of people, but might not be plush enough for those used to the finer things in life. Volkswagen gave the Touareg a little nip and tuck in 2023, which introduced a new-look grille at the front, updated bumpers and a full-width rear light bar (which includes a questionable illuminated VW badge). It’s not as instantly recognisable as a Porsche Cayenne, but it’s inoffensively handsome. It’s a bit more impressive inside, with the central touchscreen that blends into a 15.0-inch digital driver’s display. The central screen is larger than anything you’ll find in an Audi, BMW, Mercedes or maybe even your local Vue cinema, and controls almost all of the VW’s features – from the sat nav to the climate control. This is all standard on post-2023 models. Group test: Audi Q7 v BMW X5 v Mercedes GLE v Porsche Cayenne v VW Touareg It’s not just high-tech, because the Touareg comes with a slick, sweeping cabin design that looks suitably upmarket, but a few cheap-feeling materials do let the Volkswagen down a bit, such as on the centre console and lower surfaces of the dashboard. Overall it’s a very plush place to sit, but for the price the likes of BMW and Audi do it better. The VW Touareg’s excellent practicality means you might be able to forgive a few scratchy pieces of plastic, however. There’s ample space for very tall adults in both the front and rear seats, and – besides the rather shallow tray under the armrest – all its cubby holes and storage bins are pretty generous. The ISOFIX anchor points are a doddle to access, too, and the large rear door openings make it easy to fit a bulky child seat. It’s not just spacious in the back seats, because the Volkswagen Touareg comes with a seriously big boot, too. With the back seats in place, there’s more room for a few sets of golf clubs or a large baby buggy than in anything else you might be considering – though the Audi Q7 and Mercedes GLE have a bit more room with the back seats folded. It’s a shame there’s no seven-seat option, though. There are five engine options, but VW’s 231hp 3.0-litre diesel engine fits the bill perfectly for most. This turbocharged V6 has plenty of grunt to pull heavy trailers or blast past slow-moving traffic. It’s impressively quiet around town and whispers along almost silently at motorway speeds, though company car buyers will be more tempted by the lower tax you get with the plug-in hybrids. The Volkswagen Touareg is a lovely thing to cruise around in comfort, it’s just a shame it’s not a bit cheaper Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Driving the Volkswagen Touareg is pretty relaxing – despite its daunting size. You get a good view out and the light steering makes squeezing through tight spaces as easy as in any large SUV. If you spend lots of time driving in town, the optional four-wheel steering is well worth considering – it helps make the VW Touareg even more manoeuvrable by altering the angle of both the front and rear wheels to help you turn as tightly as possible. The standard automatic gearbox changes gear smoothly and doesn’t jerk or stutter at slow speeds, though it can be a bit slow to respond when you put your foot down on the motorway, though the Touareg is incredibly quiet and comfortable when driving at higher speeds. And that’s where much of its appeal lies, coupled with the spacious cabin and boot. It’s just a shame that the Touareg is a similar price to posher alternatives such as the Audi Q7 and BMW X5. As a result, you’re going to want to head over to Carwow’s Volkswagen Touareg deals page to see how much you could save, or browse the latest used Touareg stock available from our network of trusted dealers.

volkswagen,id3,"Is the Volkswagen ID3 a good car? The Volkswagen ID3 is basically the electric car equivalent to the Volkswagen Golf. It’s a mid-sized family hatchback which is the baby of Volkswagen’s EV range. Launched in 2019 and updated in 2023, the ID3 will fall on your shortlist if you’re considering other small-ish electric cars such as the Kia EV3, MG4 EV, Renault Megane E-Tech, or Tesla Model 3. The ID3 is as futuristic as it gets from Volkswagen, but being the brand of the ‘people’s car’ such modernism still has to be user-friendly and carefully implemented. A bit like trying to introduce your grandma to her new mobile phone. Before its facelift, the ID3 didn’t do this especially well and attracted criticism for its awkward user interface, but the 2023 update went a long way to addressing this with a new infotainment system and improved interior materials. The ID3 is a different shape to most hatchbacks - it’s quite tall, almost like a mini-MPV. A short bonnet, steep windscreen and big wheels all mean it stands out from the crowd. It’s not exactly handsome, but it’s a clean design - improved in the 2023 facelift which took away a set of silly decals that used to be standard on the rear pillar. Volkswagen ID3: electric range, battery and charging data Range: 261-369 milesEfficiency: 4.1-4.3 miles per kWhBattery size: 52kWh/ 58kWh / 77kWh / 79kWhMax charge speed: 120kW / 170kW / 185kWCharge time AC: 9hrs 30mins, 0-100%, 7kW / 12hrs 40mins, 0-100%, 7kWCharge time DC: 35mins, 5-80%, 120kW / 30mins, 5-80%, 170kWCharge port location: Right rearPower outputs: 170hp / 204hp / 326hp It’s even more minimalist on the inside. You get very few physical buttons, with most controls being routed through either the 12.9-inch touchscreen display or the touch-sensitive steering wheel buttons. In a bid to remove as much switchgear as possible Volkswagen’s even shunned separate controls for the rear windows. All this tech can be quite annoying to use - particularly the touch-sensitive sliders underneath the infotainment screen, which aren’t backlit at night and are really tricky to find when you’re driving. Space in the cabin benefits from the ID3’s tall silhouette, with good headroom and plenty of legroom. There’s a totally flat floor and the centre console is low, giving a nice feeling of airiness - helped by loads of glass, particularly the extra windows in the windscreen pillars that give you a good view at junctions. There are a choice of battery sizes and electric motors. The basic ‘Pure’ models can go around 240 miles on a charge and have modest performance, but you can step up through Pro and Pro S models with increasingly bigger ranges. The top model is the GTX - a performance-biased model that gets a sporty makeover, the biggest battery and the most powerful electric motor. The ID3 has a spacious interior and drives well - but the minimalist dashboard may wind you up Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer All ID3s are rear-wheel drive and feel nice and solid on the road. Bumps and potholes are a bit too obvious, especially in models wearing the largest 20-inch alloy wheels, but the steering feels accurate and the turning circle is really tight. It’s good on a longer run too, with punch acceleration and good refinement at a cruise. What it’s not is particularly exciting - even the hot hatchback-like ID3 GTX. There’s a nice sensation that the rear-wheel drive is pushing you out of corners rather than pulling you around them, but otherwise there’s little enjoyment to be had - instead it feels neutral and safe. So while the VW ID3 is a pretty good electric car, it’s also one that struggles to stand out - there are loads of cheaper alternatives which are just as practical and feel every bit as solid and reassuring, even if they don’t quite have the Volkswagen’s badge kudos. If you’re interested, check out the best Volkswagen ID3 deals right here on Carwow. You can get a great price with our Volkswagen ID3 leasing deals, or find a used Volkswagen ID3 for sale too.

volkswagen,id4,"Is the Volkswagen ID4 a good car? You love SUVs and more and more of you are loving electric cars, that makes the new Volkswagen ID4 electric SUV a case of possibly the right product at the right time. Although, with some impressive alternatives like the Tesla Model Y and Nissan Ariya also joining the fray, it doesn’t quite have things all its own way. The VW ID4 is about the same size as the company’s Tiguan SUV and should be just as practical – but a bit more futuristic-looking. If you and your sibling are the VW Golf and Tiguan, then the ID3 and ID4 are a bit like your posh cousins who always have the latest fashion and tech. You get a number of engine and battery options, with power outputs spanning 146hp to 295hp, and ranges starting at 213 miles and going up to 328 miles. Rear-wheel-drive is standard with top specs getting all-wheel-drive. The ID4 is supposed to follow the look of the ID3 and like that car, it has slim LED headlights connected by a full-width LED light bar, while a large intake sits low on the bumper. You’ll spot that there’s no grille (electric cars don’t need them because they don’t have a hot engine to cool). Volkswagen ID4: Electric range, battery and charging data Range: 317-337 milesEfficiency: 3.9-4.1 miles per kWhBattery size: 77kWhMax charge speed: 135kW / 175kWCharge time AC: 12hrs 40mins, 0-100% at 7kWCharge time DC: 28 mins, 10-80% at 135kW / 28 mins, 0-80% at 175kWCharge port location: Right rearPower outputs: 282hp / 335hp And that’s about it for the front-end highlights. At the back, a wide lightbar mimics the similar element of the front of the car. But with a high bonnet and bulbous back end, the ID4 is a bit blobby and heavy-looking. It has a simpler design inside, though. For a start, there’s no gear lever — rather, you simply twist a large knob behind the steering wheel, similar to that on a BMW i3. However, the wheel obscures the switch, so you have to crane around the rim to see it. Speaking of that driver’s display, it gives you key information, such as speed and charge status, on a sharp display. For other functions, there’s a 10.0-inch infotainment system, or 12.0-inch on top trims. There are comparatively few buttons, because most functions are operated through the central screen. You can also use your voice to control the infotainment settings on the move, although as with many systems of this kind it can be glitchy. The looks might not be to all tastes, but there's a good all-round EV underneath the ID4's skin Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Interior quality isn’t great either – there are some scratchy plastics – but at least the ID4 is comfortable. There’s lots of adjustment for the driver’s seat and steering wheel so you should be able to find a good driving position. And there’s loads of space in the rear seat, so passengers in the back should be comfy too – even in the middle seat. As for boot space, the Volkswagen ID4 offers 543 litres — ever so slightly more than the 510 litres in the BMW iX3’s boot. To keep with the Volkswagen Tiguan comparison, the ID4 doesn’t quite match its 615 litres, but given the size of the batteries underneath the floor in the ID4 it’s a fair effort.

volkswagen,id5,"Is the Volkswagen ID.5 a good car? Much like a Golden Retriever in a baseball cap and running shoes, the Volkswagen ID5 is the sporty-looking version of the sensible ID4 electric SUV. It’s much the same car, but where the ID4 has a big, boxy rear end the ID5 has a rakish roofline instead. You still get tall, bluff front and rear ends - a la ID4 - with big, aggressive head lights and curves aplenty. At the back is the same light bar too, but the ID5 has a little boot spoiler on the edge of the tailgate. It’s a decent looking thing, less frumpy than the ID4, though still less distinctive than the Audi Q4 e-tron Sportback and Skoda Enyaq Coupe. At first glance the interior is much the same fare as the outside, sleek and minimalistic with a few swoopy lines on the dashboard and a pair of modern-looking displays. It doesn’t take long to realise that the interior quality isn’t up to par though, with far too many scratchy, hard plastics in easy to reach places spoiling the cabin. Volkswagen ID.5: electric range, battery and charging data Range: 226-344 milesEfficiency: 3.7-3.9 miles per kWhBattery size: 52kWh / 77kWh / 79kWhMax charge speed: 135kWCharge time AC: 12hrs, 0-100% at 7kW / 8hrs, 0-100% at 22kWCharge time DC: 30 mins, 20-80% at 135kWCharge port location: Left rightPower outputs: 170hp / 286hp / 344hp It’s a shame as there are some really clever touches inside the ID5. The latest version of the infotainment is slick and easy to use, unlike some recent Volkswagen attempts, and the optional augmented reality head-up display is reassuring on the motorway as you don’t need to look away from the road as often. Yes the touchscreen climate controls are still a bit fiddly to use, but they don’t take long to get used to. The seats are especially comfortable with loads of adjustability, and there’s good front cabin storage including a deep centre console cubby and big door pockets. The rear bench is comfy, with good legroom and a surprisingly large amount of headroom for such a low roofline. It’s just a shame the boot’s shape is compromised by the sloping tailgate, because while it’s larger than the ID4’s at 549 litres, you can’t fit particularly boxy items in. Still, with a comfy interior and a big boot the ID5 makes for a great road trip EV, especially with a claimed range of up to 343 miles with the biggest battery. The entry-level model has a smaller battery with a max range of 226 miles. We managed respectable efficiency of 3.6mi/kWh on a long drive, largely on the motorway, in the long range model. That equates to a real-world range of 277 miles - 80% of Volkswagen’s claim. A twisty road is far from fun in the ID5 though, with steering that’s devoid of any sense of what the front wheels are doing. You need to put a lot of angle into turning the steering wheel, even in sport mode, so while there’s plenty of grip you’re best off driving the ID5 at a moderate pace. The ID5’s coupe roofline does make it easier on the eyes than the blobby, bloated-looking ID4, but I’m still not sure I’d call it a handsome car Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Motorways are much better, even if there’s a touch too much wind noise, but the clever suite of driving assistance tech combined with a good high-speed comfort make the ID5 an easy car to cover ground in. The city is where it feels most at home, though it’s a tricky car to place on the road. The bonnet lines make it hard to judge the ID5’s size, which combined with the slow steering and spongy brakes can knock your confidence when manoeuvring down a tight city street. Bigger bumps are absorbed rather effectively, but potholes and cracked roads aren’t smoothed out as well as they are in alternatives such as the Volvo EX30 and Kia EV6. Good looks, useful practicality and real-world efficiency mean the ID5 is a perfectly adequate family SUV, but it does lose its shine thanks to some disappointing driving characteristics and questionable interior materials. Still, it’s worth considering, so you can check out our new Volkswagen ID5 deals or have a look at our ID5 leasing options instead.

volkswagen,id7,"Is the Volkswagen ID7 a good car? The fourth model in Volkswagen’s electric car line-up, the ID7 is a family saloon with a sporty design that should appeal to you if you haven’t succumbed to the SUV fever that has taken hold of buyers in the last decade or so. As a left-field alternative to the SUV, it’s a bit like sticking with skinny jeans when the on-trend fashionable types have moved on to baggier ones. First impressions are strong, with the long ID7 (it’s a shade under five metres from bumper to bumper) looking like a modern family car, with a swooping roof that makes it look slick and sporty. Inside, there’s plenty of space throughout, with a lot of legroom and headroom – despite the fact that the ID7 has the lowest roof of any of VW’s electric models. The boot has a 532-litre capacity, increasing to 1,586 litres if you lower the rear seats, so it should be enough for most family uses. If not, the more practical ID7 Tourer could be worth waiting for. Helping to make the cabin more airy is an optional full-length glass roof with smart glass, where the layers of glass in the sunroof can be electronically switched between opaque and clear, using a slider in the roof or voice control (which we’ll come to in a minute). Car manufacturers are very keen on introducing new technologies in their shiny, new zero-emissions vehicles: in this case, Volkswagen’s nifty innovation is an augmented-reality head-up display (HUD), which comes as standard on all ID7s. VW's new electric flagship looks like great value if you take its size and range into consideration Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The HUD is some pretty clever tech, but it’s also significant because it has a knock-on effect on the layout of the cockpit. The traditional instruments become smaller (because the driver won’t need to look at them as much) which is an innovation that works well, while Volkswagen has also given the infotainment system a more intuitive menu structure on its 15.0-inch touchscreen. Another way in which the ID7 hints at what will be the norm in future cars is the voice control feature. Voice controls aren’t new, by any means, but systems like the ID7’s are now more like the ones on smartphones, responding to commands or questions that are spoken more naturally. Whether that means it will interrupt the conversations between the driver and front-seat passenger (awkward!) remains to be seen. In the future, it'll even be integrated with AI functionality from ChatGPT. As the ID7 is a relatively large car, there’s plenty of room under the floor for a battery pack – and the first versions of the model to go on sale have a 77kWh battery. This bigger-than-average battery means that the ID7 has a range of up to 386 miles, with its 286hp motor enabling a respectable 6.5-second 0-62mph time. A version with an even larger battery will arrive later in 2024 with a range of about 430 miles – enough to drive from London to Edinburgh without stopping (theoretically, although your bladder might have something to say). The onboard charging system is pretty state of the art, too. You can charge an ID7 on one of those fancy (and expensive) ultra-rapid chargers at the motorway services, taking enough electricity in 10 minutes to cover 126 miles: you can also charge a battery at 10% up to 80% in 28 minutes. If all this sounds good, keep reading for our full take on the ID7.

volkswagen,id7-tourer,"Is the Volkswagen ID7 Tourer a good car? Volkswagen has a long history of making great, large estate cars - the VW ID7 Tourer is the company’s latest, and in many ways one of its best. It’s a large, family-sized electric car, but being an estate instead of an SUV means it’s both better to drive and look at than VW’s own ID4 or ID5 models. Compared to those two cars, it’s like the annoying overachieving sibling - it’s handsomer, better at everything and should by all rights be the most popular. Yet the craze for SUVs means many buyers will look right past it, which is a shame. There are a few all-electric estate car alternatives to the ID7 Tourer, but they’re either a fair bit cheaper or much, much more expensive. In the former camp there’s the MG5 EV and above that, the closely-related Vauxhall Astra Sports Tourer Electric and Peugeot E-308 SW. On the other side, the BMW i5 Touring and Porsche Taycan Sport Turismo offer much more of a luxury experience - but with far more of a luxury price tag. Volkswagen ID7 Tourer: electric range, battery and charging data Range: 358 - 424 milesEfficiency: 4.1 - 4.9 mi/kWhBattery size: 77kWh/86kWhMax charge speed: 175kW/200kWCharge time AC: 11hrs 55m/12hrs 50m 0-100%Charge time DC: 30m 10-80%Charge port location: Right rearPower outputs: 286hp/340hp The ID7 Tourer looks great from the outside. It has a minimalist aesthetic, like Volkswagen’s other electric cars, and the design is dominated by a full-width lightbar at either end. The front one even incorporates a light-up Volkswagen logo, so that everyone knows what you’re driving even after dark. On the inside, practicality is a very strong point. Even when the front seats are all the way back, there’s room in the rear for a six-footer to get really comfortable - and thanks to the Tourer’s greater headroom compared to the ID7 hatch, they’ll have even more space. Meanwhile, the ID7 Tourer’s boot is larger than any other electric estate car on sale - it’s also bigger than VW’s own ID4 SUV. Interior quality is a step up compared to the other cars in the ID line-up. Everything feels nicely-built, but there’s still an over-reliance on screens over physical buttons. Other than a hazard warning switch, everything on the ID7’s interior is controlled through either the central touchscreen or the touch-sensitive steering wheel controls. The Volkswagen ID7 Tourer is spacious inside, has a massive boot and goes a long way between charges. Still want that SUV? Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer It makes the ID7 quite difficult to recommend to anyone who isn’t a bit of a technophile - having the air-con controls through the screen is one thing, but using it to control the direction of the air vents is a step too far. The ID7 Tourer’s powertrain is tied to the trim level, and there are two battery sizes and two electric motors to choose from. Even the more basic Pro Match model can do over 300 miles on a charge, but if you opt for the Pro S Match version you get an official range of 424 miles - that’s one of the longest-range electric cars on sale. We’ll update this review with driving impressions once we’ve been behind the wheel. If you can’t wait until then, check out Carwow’s Volkswagen ID7 Tourer deals to get a great price.

volkswagen,tiguan,"Is the Volkswagen Tiguan a good car? The Volkswagen Tiguan has one of the simplest recipes of any family SUV. It looks good without being too in-yer-face, is spacious without being intimidating to drive in town, and has a lovely interior without being so posh you’re scared to get your kids’ grubby figures anywhere near it. All features that earned it a Highly Commended award in the Family Values category of the 2025 Carwow Car of the Year Awards. It’s the spaghetti bolognese of the car world. It might be simple but there’s rarely a circumstance where it doesn’t hit the spot. However, like your spaghetti is just one of a number of pasta dishes you could order, there are numerous Tiguan alternatives that are similarly sized, similarly priced SUVs. Go for a top-spec model and it’s an alternative to posh SUVs such as the Audi Q3 and BMW X1, though it does lack some of their badge appeal. Or you could consider an entry-level version alongside a well-specced Nissan Qashqai or Kia Sportage. Where the Volkswagen Tiguan has an advantage over all of those cars is its boot, which at 652 litres is considerably bigger than anything else at a similar price. That means you’ll be able to fit prams and after-school sports equipment all at once, should the need arise. The interior design is all-new, with a massive infotainment touchscreen in the centre of the dashboard, making it not far off those upmarket BMW and Audi alternatives. There are configurable shortcut buttons across the top and bottom of the display, with the large central home screen showing the sat nav, music and other important information. It’s quick to respond to inputs and has bright, clear graphics, but you still get Volkswagen’s unintuitive touch-sensitive sliders for the climate control. On the plus side, you also get an excellent digital instrument display, which is included as standard and bigger than the one on the old Tiguan. The new Volkswagen Tiguan has one of the most modern, high-tech interiors of any mid-sized family SUV Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The exterior hasn’t had quite such an extensive overhaul as the interior, but the old Tiguan was starting to look dated, so the sleek LED headlights that run into a full-width black panel give it a fresh new look. At the back, you get a similar light panel that runs along the bootlid, but the likes of the Kia Sportage are more interesting to look at. A diesel engine is a rare treat these days for those who do big miles, but one of the two petrols will be a better fit for most drivers. A pair of plug-in hybrids are on the way later in 2024, with a useful electric-only range of 62 miles. They will be a bit more expensive than other engines but low running costs could make it the best pick if you have access to regular charging. It’s worth waiting for the plug-in if you need a company car, because it will have the lowest Benefit-in-Kind tax rate by far. There will be no electric Tiguan, so check out our list of the best electric SUVs if that’s what you’re after. Behind the wheel, the Tiguan is quiet, comfortable and refined to drive around town and on the motorway. The suspension is well-judged, so that it soaks up big bumps without causing the body to wobble around. This makes the Tiguan a great car for daily driving duties, but the light steering and refined suspension mean it’s not the most exciting car on a twisty road, even if you pop it into its sportiest setting. If you like what you hear you can see how much you could save with Carwow’s Volkswagen Tiguan deals. You could also get a great deal on the outgoing car by browsing used Tiguan models, as well as extensive stock of other used Volkswagens from our network of trusted dealers.

volkswagen,passat,"Is the Volkswagen Passat a good car? The Volkswagen Passat is back, and this time there’s no saloon option – you can only get it as a mega spacious estate. That’s no problem, though, because it has always stood out for being big, practical and not quite as expensive as other Passat alternatives such as the Audi A4 Avant, BMW 3 Series Touring and Mercedes C-Class Estate. (Though the Skoda Superb Estate is the real value wagon.) It’s a bit like buying designer gear from TK Maxx – you’re getting the same sort of quality as you would from a big name store, but you don’t feel quite as posh in the process. Not that the Passat looks like a cheap alternative. It’s always had an understated class, and that continues with the latest model – it’s perhaps not as elegant as its predecessor but it’s certainly smart enough. And if you go for the R-Line model you get a big, imposing grille up front to go with the smart full-width rear light bar that’s standard across the range. It’s inside where Volkswagen has really taken the Passat up a notch, though. There’s a massive infotainment display in the centre of the dashboard that runs Volkswagen’s latest software. It’s a big improvement on recent VW systems, even if it is a touch annoying having to do everything through the screen. Running behind this and into the digital instrument display is an illuminated panel that gives the Passat a cool modern look, particularly at night. Overall build quality and refinement are great, too. The Volkswagen Passat is really practical and comfortable to drive, but it is a bit dull Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer There’s buckets of space whether you’re sitting in the front or the back, and there’s loads of room for a child seat, though an SUV requires you to bend down less. With a boot capacity of 690 litres with all seats in place, or 1,920 litres if you fold the second row down, there’s huge luggage capacity and useful square space that makes it easy to load up. Despite the Passat’s popularity with long-distance drivers, there are no diesel engines anymore. There's a 1.5-litre petrol making 150hp, but company car buyers will be more tempted by one of the two plug-in hybrid options, because of the lower benefit-in-kind rate. Both offer an excellent electric range of up to 80 miles, as well as impressive charge speeds by hybrid standards. They are a great choice if you do a lot of city driving, because the long range means you can pootle around on electric power to keep fuel bills down, but whichever engine you go for the Passat is a refined and comfortable car to cruise around in. It’s at its best on the motorway, and while you do notice a few sharper bumps in the cabin, the car settles quickly. It’s not particularly sporty though, so a BMW 3 Series Touring will be better if you want to make the most of the occasional twisty road. Find out how much you can save by browsing the latest new Volkswagen Passat deals available on Carwow.

volkswagen,golf,"Is the Volkswagen Golf a good car? It’s fair to say that the Volkswagen Golf defines the family hatchback - it’s the benchmark by which all of its alternatives such as the Ford Focus, Vauxhall Astra and Honda Civic are measured. At the same time, it’s posh enough that you could quite happily compare it to upmarket cars such as the BMW 1 Series or Audi A3. The Golf is the Coca Cola or Heinz Ketchup of cars - it’s been the default choice for an astonishing amount of buyers in its five decades on sale. And just like coke or ketchup, while there may be alternatives or new players that offer something different - perhaps, in some situations, better - the default choice is still extremely good and hard to top. The current Golf is the Mk8 model, which was first launched in 2020. An update in 2024 took into account customer feedback and made myriad small tweaks and improvements, particularly to the interior and software. The exterior hasn’t had such a big makeover. The new headlights - full LED on all models - are smart, and on some versions joined by a light bar and even an illuminated VW logo. The taillights are slightly updated, too, and the bumpers have been redesigned. It’s still not what you’d call a particularly exciting-looking, but it is smart and inoffensive - which is more than you can say about the latest BMW 1 Series. Inside, the Golf still retains its trademark solid feel which has been an enduringly popular feature ever since the Mk4. For 2024, Volkswagen took in customer feedback, and as a result the new model replaces the old car’s touch-sensitive steering wheel buttons with a full range of physical switches. Video group test: Audi A3 v BMW 1 Series v Mercedes A-Class v Volkswagen Golf The infotainment’s had a serious refresh too, featuring far more user-friendly software, illuminated sliders underneath the screen for quick access to volume and temperature controls, and even the AI ChatGPT built in to answer questions that the native voice assistant can’t figure out. The Golf remains as practical as ever - that is to say, totally middle of the pack. There’s more room for rear passengers than you find in a Mercedes A-Class or BMW 1 Series, but a Skoda Octavia and Ford Focus are more capacious. The boot measures 381 litres, which is again firmly average, for a totally average-sized hatchback. If you need more room, the Golf Estate has an enormous boot and slightly more rear passenger space, while being usefully cheaper than the larger Volkswagen Passat. In contrast to most alternatives, which offer fewer and fewer engines as the years go on, the Golf is available with a huge range of different options. There’s a 1.5-litre petrol, with or without a mild hybrid system and available with two power outputs, with a 2.0-litre version on the way. There’s even a choice of two 2.0-litre diesel engines, perfect for milemunchers. Two plug-in hybrids complete the engine range - a normal model badged eHybrid and the sporty-looking GTE. A refreshed Golf GTI and Golf R will join the range later. There truly is a Golf for everyone - but you can't really go wrong with one of the mid-range petrol versions. Stick to a Ford Focus if you want fun in the corners, though Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Whichever engine you choose you can be assured of a relaxing journey - the Golf majors on its feeling of solidity, refinement and stability. No, it’s not as much fun to drive as a Ford Focus or BMW 1 Series when the road gets twisty, but it’s not too far off, especially if you choose one of the models with adjustable suspension. Higher-powered cars also get more sophisticated rear suspension that helps you corner more quickly and without so much lean. With so much choice in the range - six engine options, five trim levels (plus the standalone GTE) and a massive selection of optional extras, there is a Golf for pretty much anybody - but they’re all damn good cars.

volkswagen,t-roc,"Is the Volkswagen T-Roc a good car? The Volkswagen T-Roc is a bit like a Stanley cup - it’s slightly posh, pretty expensive and incredibly popular. Volkswagen sells almost as many T-Rocs as it does Golfs, so chances are if you’re looking for a small SUV, you’ve got a T-Roc shortlisted. Luckily this Volkswagen does have quite a lot to recommend it. It’s practical, pretty good to drive, and has the enduring appeal of the Volkswagen badge. The T-Roc sits between the T-Cross and the Tiguan in Volkswagen’s range of SUVs. It’s more stylish than the boxy T-Cross, and as well as the standard SUV can be had as the hot T-Roc R or the interesting T-Roc Convertible, both of which we’ve reviewed separately. It was launched in 2017 and underwent a pretty hefty facelift in 2022. If you’re in the market for a small SUV, the T-Roc is just one of many cars you might be considering - and impressive alternatives include cars like the Peugeot 2008, Skoda Kamiq, and Ford Puma. The T-Roc may not be particularly glitzy on the outside, but it’s stylish in a solid, classy way - and that continues on the inside, with an interior that’s more function over form but still operates well and feels quite good to sit in. The T-Roc is a good all-round family car, but it’s beginning to feel a bit old hat next to more modern alternatives Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Space is decent; though the back seats are only average, you do get a very big boot. Big rear doors make it excellent for child seats, too, and the T-Roc did score five stars in Euro NCAP’s crash-testing which is reassuring if it’s going to be used as a family car. It’s pretty well-equipped as standard, too. Even entry-level cars get an 8.0-inch touchscreen that’s easy to use with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto as standard, plus a digital driver’s display, climate control, all-round parking sensors and some smart storage solutions. You do, however, pay handsomely if you want to move up the model range. The basic Life trim isn’t too expensive, but if you want the posher R-Line car with a more powerful engine the price jumps up quite a lot. With a few optional extras you can easily push the price over £40,000 - you can get a really nice BMW X1 M Sport for that sort of money. The T-Roc does drive quite well for a small SUV, though. None of the engines have any hybrid or electric trickery, but that keeps the overall weight low - and that means it corners nicely and feels light on its feet around town. The engine range is good too, and there is even a diesel option and four-wheel drive available - both increasingly rare among compact SUVs. At the entry level, there’s a 1.0-litre petrol with just 115hp which feels a bit sluggish. The 1.5-litre petrol with 150hp is probably the best all-rounder, with manual or automatic gearboxes available - while the 200hp 2.0-litre petrol is somewhat overkill. The diesels are great for very long-distance drivers, with miserly fuel consumption, but you won’t get the best from them around town. If you like what you hear you can see how much you could save with Carwow’s Volkswagen T-Roc deals. You could also get a great deal by browsing used T-Roc models, as well as extensive stock of other used Volkswagens from our network of trusted dealers.

volkswagen,t-cross,"Is the Volkswagen T-Cross a good car? The Volkswagen T-Cross is a small SUV that’s among the best in its class. If you’re a couple or a small family and you have your heart set on an SUV, then the T-Cross is a car you should be shortlisting - it drives like a hatchback, has the practicality of a mini-MPV, feels better inside than many premium models yet it’s one of the cheapest cars Volkswagen sells. The T-Cross definitely punches above its weight, then. It’s a bit like a roast chicken dinner - not flashy, not complicated, but still excellent and hits the spot most of the time. The T-Cross is based on the same underpinnings as the VW Polo hatchback, and isn’t much bigger in terms of its footprint. That means it has tons of similarly-sized SUV alternatives - from the mechanically-related SEAT Arona, to the sporty Ford Puma and the plush Peugeot 2008. Climb inside, and you’ll find the T-Cross has loads of room courtesy of its nice squared-off body. It’s one of the roomiest cars for its size, with space for six-footers to stretch out in the back especially with the neat sliding rear seat which allows you to balance legroom and luggage space. Front passengers are well treated too, and the T-Cross’ raised ride height lets you tower over most family hatchbacks for a great view out. There are so many small SUV options these days, but the Volkswagen T-Cross does at least stand out for its decent space and practicality, if not for being the most inspired choice Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer An update in 2024 improved the interior finish of the T-Cross. While older cars felt decidedly cheap and plasticky, the newer model has much nicer materials, particularly across the face of the dashboard and on the door cards where your arm rests. It also improved the technology, tidied up the trim levels, and crowd-sourced the name for the bright yellow paint (Rubber Ducky Yellow - brilliant). It also removed the very sensible physical climate controls for an awkward touch-sensitive panel, though, so it’s not all positive change. In contrast to lots of other small SUVs, you won’t find a hybrid option or a fully-electric version of the Volkswagen T-Cross. Three engines are available - a 1.0-litre petrol with 95hp or 110hp, or a more powerful 1.5-litre with 150hp. Of these, we reckon it’s the middle engine that’s by far the best - it’s powerful enough, very efficient and can be had with manual or automatic gearboxes. Regardless of engine, the T-Cross is a competent car to drive. It’s not fun like a Ford Puma, and a Citroen C3 Aircross irons out the bumps more effectively, but the little VW feels solid, reassuring and stable. Combined with a refined interior and nicely supportive seats it’s a great little SUV to cover long distances in.

volkswagen,polo,"Is the Volkswagen Polo a good car? Much like a designer sofa, the Volkswagen Polo takes an everyday item and puts a posh spin on it. It’s comfortable and has a bit more pedigree than its alternatives; while other small hatchbacks are more fun to drive, the Polo is the one you’d rather be seen in. Not that it’s the best of the bunch, because there are plenty of great hatchbacks on sale such as the Renault Clio and Peugeot 208, or electric and hybrid alternatives such as the Renault 5 and Toyota Yaris. It’s a smart looking thing, if not particularly exciting. There are loads of sharp lines around the small hatchback, with funky creases running down the Polo’s flanks, and intricately detailed LED lights on the front and back. It’s definitely more stately than sporty, and there’s more than a whiff of ‘honey I shrunk the Volkswagen Golf’ about it. Though when you sit inside, it feels anything but small. It’s more spacious than a lot of cars this size, with a wide dashboard and a glossy trim that wraps around onto the door cards. Material quality is high, with loads of soft-touch plastics and only a few scratchier surfaces lower down in the cabin. Unfortunately it is a little dour inside, as the only colours you can choose from are black and dark grey. Boo. It’s posh, comfortable and roomier than you might expect, just don’t expect any driving thrills from the Volkswagen Polo Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The Polo is easy to get comfortable in thanks to its highly adjustable front seats and steering wheel. There’s plenty of space in the back with enough headroom and legroom for rear passengers to remain comfortable on long drives - no mean feat in a small hatchback. You get a good amount of standard kit in the Volkswagen Polo, such as a swish digital driver display and an Apple CarPlay/Android Auto-enabled touchscreen infotainment screen in the dashboard. The lack of physical shortcut buttons means it can be a pain to use on the move though, and its glossy screen is a magnet for finger prints. There are no diesel options available for the Polo, just a 1.0-litre three-cylinder petrol engine with a few different power outputs. The entry level 80hp model is fine for pottering around town, but you’ll want the 95hp or 115hp version if you regularly travel on the motorway or on country lanes. Regardless of which engine you chose, the Polo is a comfortable car in town. It does a great job of absorbing lumps and bumps in the road, but its soft suspension means it doesn’t feel particularly agile on a country lane. Motorways are a breeze too, but it’s a shame you can only have a manual model with a five-speed gearbox as you do get a bit more engine noise and a bit less efficiency than you would with an extra gear. If B-road bashing is important to you then the Volkswagen Polo GTI (which we’ve reviewed separately) might be the best choice, with a much more powerful 2.0-litre turbocharged engine and stiffer, sportier suspension. Have a look at Volkswagen Polo deals on Carwow, or Polo lease deals for an alternative way to get behind the wheel of this posh little hatchback.

renault,clio,"Is the Renault Clio a good car? If you’re looking for an affordable city car, but don’t want to sacrifice on style and practicality, the Renault Clio is an excellent option. It looks great inside and out and has a bigger boot than any of its small hatchback alternatives – so it’s good looking and practical, like a supermodel wearing cargo pants. And a little nip and tuck for 2023 means it looks better than ever, with similar chic appeal to the Peugeot 208, making the pair stand out from the likes of the Ford Fiesta, Volkswagen Polo and Vauxhall Corsa. But it's so much cheaper than the 208 that it represents fantastic value - earning it a Highly Commended spot in the Smart Spender category of the 2025 Carwow Car of the Year Awards. It’s up front where it’s really eye-catching now, with slim headlights and funky vertical daytime running lights flanking a new grille and prominent Renault logo. Round the back the new look is less obvious, but a tweaked bumper helps make the Clio look much more interesting. It’s a similar story inside, with the profile-orientated infotainment display (on top-spec models) and new climate control buttons giving off a more premium feel than before. And while some scratchy plastics lower in the cabin betray the car’s price, there are plenty of soft surfaces that are suitably upmarket. For a small car, it’s not at all cramped in the front, but those in the back will struggle for kneeroom in particular. Storage is fine wherever you sit, but you’ll want to leave most things in the cavernous boot – at 391 litres it’s more spacious than any alternatives' boots. The Renault Clio is up there with the very best small cars, thanks to its stylish looks and massive boot Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer A hybrid engine gives the Renault a head start on other options, too. The Honda Jazz and Toyota Yaris are just about your only other choices for small car electrification. There’s a regular petrol engine in the Clio too, which brings the price down and is appealing for those on a budget. Out on the road the hybrid works well, with the electric motor offering instant response at lower speeds and helping to keep fuel costs low. The petrol engine can get a bit noisy when accelerating up to motorway speeds, but settles down nicely once you get there. That said, the Volkswagen Polo is a quieter and more refined small car to drive. There’s a bit more tyre roar at high speeds in the Clio, and it’s more easily ruffled by bumps in the road. It shouldn’t be enough to put you off though, and with its appealing mix of style and practicality, the Renault Clio is a car you can shortlist with your heart as well as your head – especially considering it’s also one of the more affordable options.

renault,5-e-tech,"Is the Renault 5 E-Tech a good car? The Renault 5 is an all-electric reinvention of an iconic hatchback. It’s good value for money, looks great inside and out, and it’s fun to drive – but being a small, city-friendly electric car, it’s not particularly practical. It’s a bit like finding one of your old football shirts from when you were a kid – the retro charm is very on-trend, but you might have to squeeze to fit in… There are other small electric cars to consider, none of which have particularly cavernous cabins. The Citroen e-C3 and Hyundai Inster are the obvious alternatives, but there’s also the slightly bigger, slightly more expensive BYD Dolphin. Beauty might be in the eye of the beholder but it’s hard to argue that the Renault 5 looks anything other than absolutely fantastic. Its small dimensions, boxy shape and retro look are all inspired by the ‘70s model of the same name, just with a modern spin. There are some cool details, from the broken square daytime running lights (a nod to the original) to the illuminated ‘5’ logo on the bonnet that indicates your battery charge. Renault 5: electric range, battery and charging data Range: 192 - 252 milesEfficiency: 4.1 - 4.3 miles per kWhBattery size: 40kWh / 50kWhMax charge speed: 80kW / 100kWCharge time AC: 3h 59m - 4h 51m 0 - 100%, 11kWhCharge time DC: 30 - 31m, 15 - 80%, 80-100kWhCharge port location: Right side frontPower outputs: 120hp / 150hp It’s really cool inside, too. The air vents mimic the headlight design and the dashboard ahead of the passenger has fabric, recycled denim or synthetic upholstery, depending on your trim, which looks great. There are some quirky colour combinations to be had, too. Renault has resisted the urge to plaster massive screens in a small car, so the driver display and infotainment are integrated nicely within a single housing. They’re big enough, with blocky graphics that are easy to use on the move. Snappy loading between menus and physical climate controls are further plus points, and Google software means it has useful apps built-in. Entry-level cars get a smaller driver’s display, though. As you might expect of a car this size, it’s not the most practical cabin. Space in the front is okay, especially for the passenger, but taller drivers might find the space beneath the steering wheel a bit tight. The back seats are a touch cramped, too. The flip side of this is the boot, which is an impressive 326 litres – that’s more capacity than you get in both the Mini Cooper Electric and Citroen e-C3. Retro charm makes the Renault 5 mighty appealing, but being great to drive means its beauty isn’t just skin deep Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer There are two battery options, the smaller one returning up to 190 miles and the larger one offering up to 250 miles, the latter also coming with a more powerful electric motor. That’s about par for the course for small EVs, as the e-C3 gets up to 199 miles between charges, while the Inster has between 203 and 229 miles, depending on the model. Naturally, the Renault 5 is most at home in the city, where its small dimensions and punchy electric motors make it ideal for nipping about in tight, busy urban areas, even if the suspension is a bit stiff, making you aware of small bumps in the road. These attributes also combine to create a car that’s great fun on a twisty road. Because it’s small it’s ideal for narrow strips of Tarmac in the British countryside, and the sharp steering and lack of body roll make it great fun in corners. It’s a bit noisy at motorway speeds, but no more than the Citroen and Hyundai. All in all, the Renault 5 is a fantastic little electric car. It’s oozing charm, and will put a smile on your face every time you drive it – just don’t expect all-round family car practicality. If that sounds ideal for your needs, check out the latest Renault 5 deals on Carwow, as well as Renault 5 leasing deals.

renault,symbioz,"Is the Renault Symbioz a good car? The Renault Symbioz is a bit like a Renault Captur that’s been out and got bum implants. From the front, you’d never know the two cars were different - the only changes come when you go round the rear, where the Symbioz has a longer body and a bigger boot. In many ways it’s sort of like an estate version of the Captur - like a Volkswagen Golf Estate is to a regular Golf hatchback. It’s aimed at people who like the Captur but want more space inside, and who can’t quite stretch up to the pricier, posher Renault Austral. Though it’s a little smaller, it provides an interesting alternative to super-popular family SUVs such as the Nissan Qashqai, Kia Sportage or Skoda Karoq. We’re not kidding when we tell you the Symbioz looks like a Captur. In fact, take the two cars in the same colour and from the front doors forwards, you’ll be hard-pressed to notice any changes at all. They’re limited to a couple of chrome flashes in the lower bumper line for the Symbioz, a slightly different pattern to the grille, and some alternative alloy wheel designs. The changes come from the rear doors backwards, where the Symbioz has a longer body with a bigger rear overhang to make more room for a big boot. The roofline and rear windows have been altered to accommodate this, and there’s a slightly more chiselled pattern on the rear doors. The interior's very similar too. The dashboards are identical, and feature a Google-powered infotainment system that's a pleasure to use. One feature the Symbioz has over the Captur is its stunning 'Solarbay' glass roof - this eschews a traditional blind for electrochromic glass which can become opaque at the touch of a button. Very fancy. The Symbioz is basically a Captur estate, but that’s no bad thing - it has a big boot and fantastic fuel economy. A Qashqai is nicer to drive, though Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The Symbioz has a 492-litre boot, which is quite a bit larger than the 348-litre boot you get on a hybrid Captur (the plain petrol Captur has 422 litres of space). That’s a little less room than the 504-litre Nissan Qashqai, 521-litre Skoda Karoq or 587-litre Kia Sportage, but impressive for what’s still quite a small car overall. The Symbioz is being pitched as a slightly more premium offering to the Captur, too. That means you don’t get a base-spec ‘Evolution’ trim level, nor can you specify the Captur’s 90hp petrol engine and manual gearbox. All Symbioz models come with Renault’s E-Tech hybrid system, which is super-efficient, promising over 60mpg if driven carefully. It’s a little clunky, though, thanks to its complicated gearbox, and that’s mirrored in the suspension which can feel quite firm when you’re driving round town at low speeds. In most scenarios, though, the Symbioz is perfectly fine to drive - though the extra weight does mean a Captur is more enjoyable. Interested?

renault,megane-etech-electric,"Is the Renault Megane E-Tech a good car? If you’re looking for a stylish electric hatchback, the Renault Megane E-Tech is one worth considering. It’s the sort of car to be looking at if you’re considering an electric hatchback such as the Volkswagen ID3, Cupra Born or MG4 EV. This Megane is like one of your mates who’s suddenly decided to take on a vegan, eco-conscious lifestyle. Gone are its petrol versions, with just electric power coming in its place, plus a bunch of eco-friendly materials. But more on those shortly. There’s no questioning that the Renault Megane E-Tech Electric is a looker. A striking front-end design, sleek roofline and strong selection of two-tone colour choices certainly allow it to stand out. You’ll get 18-inch wheels as standard, but there’s a set of optional 20-inch alloys if those aren’t large enough for you. It’s just as stylish inside, too. You’re met immediately with a two-spoke steering wheel that offers something of a throwback feel (if you look beyond all the buttons), plus a host of recycled fabrics that look and feel the part. You can go for leather on top-spec cars, though. Renault Megane E-Tech: Electric range, battery and charging data Range: 280 milesEfficiency: 3.9 miles per kWhBattery size: 60kWhMax charge speed: 130kWCharge time AC: 9hrs 11mins, 0-100% at 7kWCharge time DC: 1hr 14mins, 0-80% at 130kWCharge port location: Right frontPower outputs: 215hp Directly in your line of vision is a 12.3-inch digital driver’s display that’s crisp and very configurable. To the side of that, you’ll find a portrait-set infotainment system that serves as evidence car manufacturers should bin off developing their own software and leave it to tech companies. This isn’t a dig at Renault, as it uses a new Google-based system here in the Megane. It’s super-sharp, dead easy to use and comes with impressive Google Maps integration without charging you any extra for the privilege. It helps that the assistant for voice controls is easy to use and rarely mishears you, too. However, the Megane is let down a little in the practicality stakes. Its roofline helps the design, but it does mean headroom in the back isn’t great, although there’s a good amount of knee room. The Renault’s boot comes in at a healthy 440 litres, which is comfortably more than the VW ID3’s 385 litres. However, it’s hindered by a massive lip that can make loading difficult — and storing the charging cables under the boot floor will mean playing real-life Tetris every time you want to charge while carrying a full load. The Megane comes with just the one power output, giving a 220hp instant surge of torque. It comes with a 60kWh battery, which offers 292 claimed miles between charges. In other markets there is also a cheaper and lower-powered 130hp version with a choice of battery sizes, but this isn’t offered in the UK. As all get the same 220hp motor setup, choose between the Techno or Iconic trim to get the best out of your Megane Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Hook it up to a 130kW rapid charger you’ll be able to complete a full charge in a little over 70 minutes. A 7.4kW home wall box charger will take just over 9 hours. Around town, the Megane’s light and direct steering make zipping around a breeze. That said, massive pillars at the front and a narrow rear window result in pretty poor visibility. You can have a rear-view camera displayed on the mirror to help the latter issue, but it’ll cost you. Take it out on the motorway and its soft-set suspension results in a smooth ride, though this combined with light steering does detract from your ability to have fun on twisty roads.

renault,austral,"Is the Renault Austral a good car? The Renault Austral is one of many mid-sized SUVs vying for your attention, making it an alternative to the likes of the Nissan Qashqai, Hyundai Tucson, Kia Sportage, Peugeot 3008 and Volkswagen Tiguan - to name a few. With impressive options available everywhere you turn, the Renault Austral attempts to stand out with a few key features - a really posh interior, great software, and a trick hybrid system which gives this medium-sized family car fuel economy to rival many a small hatchback. It’s like shopping at a designer outlet store - you can feel like you’re living the high life for less money than you expect, but it doesn’t come without compromise. The Austral is a smart-looking SUV, with its fairly square silhouette tempered by rounded corners and some distinctive styling features. The bold headlights, large grille and huge Renault badge mean you won’t mistake it for anything else, while the rear gets similarly wide taillights (though not a full-width light bar) and a sporty-looking diffuser on the bumper. The interior is similarly stylish, with a large portrait touchscreen canted towards the driver for a really focused, cockpit-like feel. There’s even a handrest in the middle that feels like an aircraft throttle, though this actually contains a wireless charging pad and hides a storage cubby underneath it. That central touchscreen runs a fantastic Google-based infotainment system. This means that not only is it swift and responsive, but it has native support for Google apps - including the best maps in the business, and other useful touches like music streaming services baked right in. While the Austral does feature smartphone mirroring tech, if you’re already using Google services you might not find that you need it here. The Renault Austral makes for a practical family car with some cool features, but the suspension's too firm Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer While the Austral’s interior punches above its price tag, the space inside is only average. A Skoda Karoq does have more rear-seat space, and more flexible arrangements for the boot. While the Austral has a sliding rear seat, you need it pushed all the way back to fit people in - at which point you only have a 430-litre boot, which is among the smallest of all the alternatives. A Nissan Qashqai, Kia Sportage and Skoda Karoq are all larger. Renault offers the Austral with just one engine - a complex hybrid arrangement using a 1.2-litre petrol engine and a pair of electric motors. It’s fiendishly complicated and shuffles the power about in ways that don’t always seem logical. The result can feel quite clunky if you accelerate hard or are trying to hustle down a back road, but it’s perfectly smooth when you’re driving sensibly - and means this relatively large SUV can easily return over 50mpg. The driving experience is a lot like the rest of the car - it has its good moments and bad. The steering is nice and accurate, and the Austral is comfortable on a long trip - but the firm suspension means it clatters over bumps at low speeds around town, making small potholes and bumps feel much larger than they are. At launch, the Renault Austral was offered with a cool four-wheel steering system which made it incredibly manoeuvrable around town. However, as of 2024, this is no longer offered If you want a great price for this family-friendly SUV, check out our best Renault Austral deals on Carwow here.

renault,captur,"Is the Renault Captur a good car? The market is awash with small SUVs these days, meaning it takes a lot to stand out. If you’re looking for such a car with a bit of Parisian flair, the Renault Captur could be right down your alley. It’s a slightly more stylish alternative to cars like the Toyota Yaris Cross and Skoda Kamiq. It’s like comparing Nutella on toast to a freshly-baked pain au chocolat - both make for a great breakfast, but the latter looks more attractive and tastes better. The Captur was given a mid-life update in 2024 which brought a new face inspired by the Scenic E-Tech. It has arrow-shaped LED daytime running lights and redesigned bumpers, as well as a range of new alloy wheel designs. Step inside and you’re greeted with some interior upgrades as well. The rotary climate controls were ditched in favour of a neat row of toggle switches, and there’s no leather or chrome used inside to make it more eco-friendly. The biggest change though is the new Google-based infotainment system. All but the entry-level car get this and it’s really easy to use. You get Google Maps built in, as well as wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto to make it easy to pair your phone. It’s controlled through a 10.4-inch touchscreen, something you also get on the basic car without the Google software. Everything you regularly touch feels plush and well-screwed together, and there are plenty of squidgy materials throughout the cabin. A Peugeot 2008 does feel slightly more posh, but there’s not much in it. One area where the Captur impresses is boot space, because it offers more load capacity than a lot of alternatives. There’s also plenty of space up front to get comfortable behind the wheel, and there’s decent legroom in the back. Rear headroom is a bit tight though, a Skoda Kamiq is better for carrying adults. With such stiff competition the Captur had to grow up fast, and thankfully it’s done just that both inside and out Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Another party trick the Captur boasts is the sliding rear seats. You can pull them all the way forward to expand the space from 484 litres to a whopping 616 litres, making it among the largest of any small SUV. You do lose 136 litres of space if you go for the hybrid model, making it slightly smaller than a Toyota Yaris Cross’s boot, but it’s still bigger than a Nissan Juke’s. As part of the Captur’s 2024 update Renault slimmed down the engine lineup, so there are now just two to choose from. You can either have a 90hp 1.0-litre petrol engine with a six-speed manual gearbox, or there’s the 1.6-litre petrol hybrid with 145hp. If you can stretch to it, spending the extra for the hybrid is well worth it. It can run on electric power alone around town to save fuel – at low speeds the engine only cuts in when absolutely necessary and it’s hardly noticeable when it does. What’s not so good in town is the firm suspension, which jiggles and bobs you around over every bump in the road. The Captur won’t thrill you on a country road, but that’s not why you buy a small SUV. That said, the Ford Puma can put a smile on your face through the bends. More importantly, the Renault has precise steering and minimal body roll, both of which inspire confidence. Overall, the Renault Captur draws you in with its stylish exterior and it offers a practical interior and great tech. It doesn’t drive quite as nicely as some of the best small SUVs thanks to the firm suspension, but it’ll still serve you well as a great all-rounder. If this sounds like your next small SUV, then head over to our Renault Captur deals pages to see how much you can save. If you're interested in buying a used Renault Captur then head over to our used deals page, and you can also look at other used Renault models.

renault,scenic-e-tech,"Is the Renault Scenic E-Tech a good car? The Renault Scenic has been resurrected, and this time it’s ditched the dowdy MPV body in favour of being a chic, modern electric SUV. It’s a bit like when Zac Efron dropped his floppy-haired Disney kid look in favour of the gym-obsessed heartthrob appearance he has today. And chic the Scenic must be to stand out, because there are dozens of similarly sized electric SUVs vying for a spot on your shopping list, such as the Skoda Elroq, Hyundai Ioniq 5 and Peugeot E-3008. There’s also the excellent Kia EV3, which is a bit smaller and cheaper, but well worth considering. The quick win goes to the Renault Scenic, because it really does look good. At the rear you get chunky tail lights that drop down at the sides and make the car look really wide, as well as a simple but effective bumper design. Up front there are slim headlights and a fake grille with a cool gradient effect. Renault Scenic E-Tech: electric range, battery and charging data Range: 260 miles - 379 milesEfficiency: 3.6 - 3.7mi/kWhBattery size: 60kWh / 87kWhMax charge speed: 130kW / 150kWCharge time AC: 9hrs 51mins, 0-100, 7.4kW / 13hrs, 0-100%, 7.4kWCharge time DC: 32mins, 15-80%, 130kW / 37mins, 15-80%, 150kWCharge port location: Right side frontPower outputs: 170hp / 220hp The interior isn’t as immediately striking as the exterior, but it has a simple but smart appearance and there are some nice colours and materials for the upholstery, while the infotainment system is slick and easy to use. However, there are plenty of cheap materials to be found. Fortunately this is made up for with practicality, because there’s loads of storage in the cabin, plenty of adjustability in the front seats and steering wheel, and a huge amount of space in the back that also makes it good for a child seat. The boot is a good size too – at 545 litres it’s bigger than most alternatives, including the Skoda Elroq. There’s no front boot like you get in the Hyundai Ioniq 5, either. There’s a lot to love about the Renault Scenic. It’s practical, goes a long way between charges and offers great value for money. It’s a touch disappointing to drive, though Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer It might be practical, but out on the road, the Renault Scenic is a touch disappointing to drive. It’s generally quite comfortable, but it can be a bit jiggly over bumps, particularly at lower speeds. Visibility isn’t great either, and the spongy brakes take some getting used to. Now, it’s not so bad in any of these areas that the Scenic is not worth considering, it just doesn’t really stand out in any area either. For day-to-day comfort, the Hyundai Ioniq 5 is tough to beat. There are two battery and motor combinations, with the entry level version offering a respectable range of 260 miles, while the larger (more expensive) battery can go up to 379 miles between charges, according to official figures – that makes it one of the longest-range electric cars on sale.

renault,rafale,"Is the Renault Rafale a good car? The Renault Rafale is what happens when high-street brands start producing their own takes on designer fashion trends; looks great but it just isn't as posh as the bigger names. Think of it as a Weekday outfit to the Gucci BMW X4 and Hugo Boss Volvo EC40. Yet for its size and body shape it’s not a direct alternative to either of those cars, sitting somewhere in between the Germans and the cheaper Peugeot 3008 or less stylish - and electric-only - Skoda Enyaq Coupe. It’s not just in its positioning where the Rafale stands out, but in its styling too. It’s a head-turning car, with a tall, imposing front end, flanked by a pair of arrow-shaped LED running lights. The broad grille, aggressive headlights, sporty silhouette and sleek rear-end all give the Rafale a hint of baby Lamborghini Urus about it, if you squint. The interior is rather posh at a glance, but once you settle in, it’s not as luxurious as appearances suggest. The two-tier dashboard has a full-width vent detail across the passenger side and a driver-facing, portrait-oriented infotainment system. It’s mounted in the same wrap-around, driver-facing trim panel as the digital instrument cluster - and while it looks great, the gloss black detailing and air vents feel a bit cheap to the touch. The leatherette and suede on the seats, dashboard and door trims feel lovely though, and most of the high-up plastics are of the soft-touch variety. It’s a shame it’s a bit compromised, because the Renault Rafale is a great-looking car Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Boot space is good, and while the plug-in hybrid model loses out on some boot space, the regular model has more boot capacity than a Peugeot 408 and Cupra Formentor. The parcel shelf feels flimsy, and the seats don’t fold completely flat either, which is annoying. You can choose from a 200hp self-charging hybrid powertrain or a more powerful, 300hp plug-in hybrid (PHEV), both with the same 1.2-litre engine under the bonnet. The more powerful engine suits the car’s character better, and it’s a great choice for company car buyers due to its low benefit-in-kind tax rate. Driving the Rafale is a mixed bag, because while the optional four-wheel steering and responsive controls make for good progress in town, it’s far too stiff over small bumps - and bouncy over big ones. The same applies to ruts and dips on the motorway, and the road noise is far too intrusive at speed. Country lanes are better, as the darty steering, lack of body lean and tremendous levels of grip from its huge tyres are all reassuring when hustling down a back road. It’s just a shame that the steering wheel doesn’t give you much sense as to what the front wheels are doing, and the 1.2-litre engine is gruff when accelerating. As a sporty, alternative choice to the typical German or Scandinavian fare, the Rafale is worth a look, and you can find new Renault Rafale deals on Carwow. There are Renault Rafale lease deals too, as well as used Renault Rafales available through our network of trusted dealers. For something a little smaller, there are other used Renaults for sale, and Carwow can even help you sell your car when it’s time to switch.",Carwow
renault,twingo,"Is the Renault Twingo a good car? The Renault Twingo is the smallest car that Renault makes and it’s an alternative to other little city slickers, such as the Volkswagen Up, Toyota Aygo and Hyundai i10. However, if you’re familiar with previous generations of the Twingo, this is something very different. It was developed alongside the Smart ForFour, so this latest version is a rear-engined, rear-wheel drive car – a layout that has real benefits in terms of how much space the car has inside and how easy it is to drive around town. Mind you, there’s no sign of that revolutionary (for a city car) layout from the outside. That said, the car certainly looks very distinctive and, as with most little cars these days, there’s lots of scope for the owner to personalise their car. Everything from the colour of the paint to the alloy wheels can be tailored to your wishes, while you can also add on extra decals to make your car stand out. Inside, too, the contrasting colours and strong design inject a bit of fun into the experience. And, as long as you avoid the base model, you can add a few more touches of personalisation. One more clever touch is that Renault has an app that you can install on your smartphone. You then clip it into a cradle in the car, giving you an instant touchscreen, which you can use to control the sat-nav, phone and stereo. If you want a larger touchscreen, you can fit the optional R-Link system, which has an integrated 7.0-inch screen, through which you control the various parts of the infotainment system. Where the Renault Twingo really stands out from the alternatives is how much room it has inside. Four adults can fit with ease and getting in and out is not the contortionist’s feat it can be in some small cars. Mind you, the optional fabric sunroof reduces the available headroom quite significantly, so be sure that won’t be a problem before ticking that box. That excellent cabin space is thanks to having the engine at the back, but there are some compromises with that layout. Most obviously, as the engine sits below the boot floor, the boot capacity is only 188 litres, which is a little less than you’ll find in an Up, for example. When I read that the Twingo was going to be a small, rear-engined, rear-wheel car, I was really excited. Then I drove it. What a disappointment. Mat Watson Carwow expert You can increase this by putting the rear seat backs up to 90 degrees, which isn’t especially comfortable, but there’s also around 50 litres of storage dotted around in the cabin too in various pockets and bins. You can also fold the front passenger seat flat and the Renault Twingo will accept loads up to 2.3-metres long. The one thing that the rear-engined layout doesn’t do is to turn the Twingo into some sort of mini-Porsche 911 supercar, which famously shares the same arrangement. In fact, this doesn’t feel like a particularly sporty car to drive at all – but it’s not without its benefits. For example, with no engine at the front of the car, the nose feels a lot lighter. And, because the car is rear-wheel drive, the front wheels can turn further than in a front-wheel drive car, giving a very tight turning circle. As a result, the car is wonderfully easy to manoeuvre around town and get into the smallest parking spaces. However, on the open road, it’s not the most enjoyable little car to drive. In part, that’s because the stability control system is a little over-eager to get involved when the driver gets a little keener and starts to tackle bends a bit more quickly. Likewise, the Twingo isn’t the most comfortable little car, especially the models with larger wheels fitted. The VW Up and Hyundai i10 both have a more settled and more mature feel on the road. As is often the case with these small cars, there’s only a small range of engines to pick from. So, if you want a Twingo, you can only choose between two engines: a 1.0-litre unit with 70hp and a more powerful 0.9-litre turbo, with 90hp. The 1.0-litre unit is enough if you spend most of your time driving around town, but it’s worth going for the stronger unit if you plan on making longer journeys beyond the city limits. No matter where you’re heading, you’ll be pleased to know that the Renault Twingo has a reasonable four-star rating from Euro NCAP, which is pretty much identical to what you’ll find in most alternatives. Less happily, the Renault Twingo costs a bit more than the most obvious alternatives, but every model comes well equipped – with DAB radio, front electric windows, split folding rear seats, LED daytime running lights, a tyre pressure monitoring system and USB connectivity. Despite that high level of standard equipment and generous space for passengers, the Twingo is hard to recommend over the alternatives. It’s a little on the pricey side at the bottom end of the range and, while the more expensive models (with the stronger engine) make more sense, they cost as much as larger vehicles that offer far more space.",Carwow
renault,megane,"Is the Renault Megane a good car? This version of the Renault Megane first came on sale in 2016 but received a range of updates in 2018, including improvements to the infotainment system and more space for passengers. The Megane is similar in size to the Hyundai i30, Kia Ceed and Ford Focus, but also shares a lot of parts with the Renault Kadjar SUV. The Renault Megane’s interior looks simpler than in most alternatives so most of the buttons are easy to locate. High-spec models also get a portrait-style infotainment system, similar to what you’d find in more expensive Volvo cars. The rest of the cabin is well put together and has some silver accents to break up the otherwise all-black colour scheme. Getting a good driving position is easy even in the entry-level Renault Megane because they get height-adjustable front seats as standard. You can also set the seat nice and low for a sporty feel and front seat passenger space is good. Accessing the rear seats is easy thanks to wide-opening doors and you can fit two adults without much hassle – three would be a push, because the middle rear seat is narrower than the outer two. In terms of practicality, the Renault Megane’s boot is just about big enough for a week’s holiday worth of luggage and the opening is wide enough so you won’t have problems loading bulky items. However, some alternatives, such as the Kia Ceed, have a lower load lip making them even more practical. The Renault Megane won’t wow you with a sporty drive, but you’ll be impressed by how comfortable it is. Mat Watson Carwow expert There are two engines to choose from in the Renault Megane range so picking the right one is easy. The 140bhp petrol is hushed on the move and feels best darting around city streets. The 115bhp diesel is perfect for longer motorway journeys where it settles nicely into a cruise and uses very little fuel. Driving the Renault Megane feels best on the motorway. Once up to speed there’s little wind noise and the Megane absorbs bumps very well. That isn’t to say it’s not good around town – there, the quick steering helps you dart in and out of traffic with confidence, however the manual gear shift is notchy and not that pleasurable to use. No matter if you drive in town or on the motorway, the Renault Megane is a safe car. It was awarded the full five stars from EuroNCAP and, as standard, you get essentials such as airbags, an advanced stability control system and hill-hold assist. Mid-range models also get lane departure warning, traffic sign recognition and automatic high-low beam as standard.",Carwow
renault,kadjar,"Is the Renault Kadjar a good car? The Renault Kadjar is the French firm’s contender in the big-selling family SUV category. These cars sell in huge numbers these days because they’re more spacious than a conventional hatchback with a higher driving position, although they cost a bit more to run. Think of the Renault Kadjar as a Nissan Qashqai with a little more je ne sais quoi and you won’t go far wrong, because underneath it shares much of its running gear with the Japanese car. The Renault Kadjar looks a lot more imposing on the outside than a hatchback such as the VW Golf or Renault Megane. It comes with large alloy wheels, a smattering of chrome trim and plenty of contrasting black trim on the bumpers and wheel arches so it’ll have no trouble standing out on the school run. Sadly, the Renault Kadjar’s interior isn’t quite as eye-catching as that in some other SUVs. Sure, it has plenty of soft plastics and a few brushed metal trims, but the Kia Sportage looks more exciting while the VW Tiguan feels more solidly put together. It comes with a good deal of equipment though, you get a digital driver’s display as standard, alongside a touchscreen infotainment system. It all looks pretty flash, but using the built-in sat nav is a bit trickier than in alternatives – a bit like paying for something with cash rather than using your contactless bank card. You could be forgiven for thinking the Kadjar looks a bit like a Qashqai – they’re essentially the same car, although the Nissan is more comfortable and the Renault’s a bit roomier Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer At least you’ll be sitting comfortably while you fiddle with the Renault Kadjar’s touchscreen. You get plenty of seat and steering-wheel adjustment as standard and there’s enough space for you to stretch out if you’re tall. It’s a similar story in the back where there’s room for three adults, but you don’t get any clever sliding seats like in the Skoda Karoq. The boot’s roomy enough for everyone’s luggage, though, and the flat boot floor makes it easy to slide in heavy luggage. There’s a 138hp petrol engine which provides a good mix of performance and efficiency, and you can option it with an automatic transmission rather than the manual to help take the stress out of town driving. Whichever transmission you pick, you’ll find the Renault Kadjar is pretty comfortable to drive. It doesn’t quite iron out bumps as well as the Nissan Qashqai, but it’s more relaxing than the Kia Sportage and Hyundai Tucson and doesn’t lean a great deal in tight corners. Unfortunately, the Kadjar is a little noisy to drive at motorway speeds. This isn’t because of its engine, rather you’ll hear quite a lot of wind and tyre noise. To help make things a bit more relaxing, you can get it with a range of driver assistance systems from automatic emergency braking and cruise control to lane-departure warning. All this makes the Renault Kadjar pretty easy to live with every day. It’s certainly an SUV that’s well worth considering if you’re looking for something that’s easy to drive, practical and pretty well equipped. Head over to the deals page to find some great deals on a brand new SUV, and if you're wanting a used Renault Kadjar then we have a great range of second-hand ones to choose from.",Carwow
renault,scenic,"Is the Renault Scenic a good car? Considering how boring the old model was, the new Renault Scenic makes for a welcome a dose of continental fresh air. It’s an imposing car to look at – it’s 20mm wider than the car it replaces and comes as standard with two-tone paint and blingy 20-inch alloy wheels that look, well, fantastic! Those looks couldn’t come at the expense of practicality, though, so the Renault has a big boot, cubbyholes and under-seat bins that provide 63 litres of storage and one of the most elaborate gloveboxes we have ever seen. The engine range is extensive, too. Buyers can choose from five diesels, two petrols and a diesel-electric hybrid that returns fuel economy of 80.4mpg. Petrols are manual only, but diesels are available with a six-speed manual or a dual-clutch auto with the same number of gears. All models come with emergency city braking that works at speed of up to 31mph and can detect people (a class first), cruise control, two Isofix child-seat mounting points, a height adjustable driver’s seat and a Bluetooth phone connection. If you like the look of an SUV, but don't need the high ride height, the Scenic is perfect for you Mat Watson Carwow expert The Renault Espace was arguably the first MPV ever made and that expertise shows in this new Scenic. There’s much to like here, not least its cheap running costs and practical interior. Sure, the VW Touran is better to drive and the Citroen C4 Picasso is more comfortable, but the Scenic – much like the Espace – offers something genuinely unique here – stylish looks that don’t punish you for needing a practical car.",Carwow
renault,arkana,"Is the Renault Arkana a good car? If you fancy a sporty-looking coupe SUV, your only options used to be big, posh German cars like the BMW X4 and Mercedes GLC Coupe, but there are a couple of more reasonably-priced models out there now which offer similar sleek styling, one of these being the Renault Arkana. You can think of it as a slightly left-field alternative to cars such as the Skoda Karoq or the Nissan Qashqai. If those cars are a bowl of porridge for breakfast, the Arkana is more like a pain au chocolat. It may not be as sensible, but it’s a more exciting option. You may also be considering the Peugeot 408, which has bolder styling. The front end will be familiar from other Renaults thanks to the C-shaped LED running lights, and you get LED headlights on mid-spec cars and up. It’s the side profile that really sets the Arkana apart, with a swoopy coupe-esque roofline lending it a sporty edge over alternatives. This may look cool, however it doesn’t do much for interior space. While those up front won’t have any trouble getting comfortable, thanks to plenty of adjustment in the seats and steering wheel, the back seats aren't quite so accommodating. Headroom is pretty limited and there’s not much in the way of legroom either. A Skoda Karoq is a better bet for carrying people on a regular basis. It may not be the most practical cabin, but at least it's well made. There are plenty of plush materials to be found, and everything feels well screwed together. The metallic feeling dials for the climate control are a particularly welcome addition, however, the interior doesn’t have quite the same design flair as a Peugeot 408. At 480 litres, the boot is a decent size. It’s slightly bigger than a Peugeot 408 hybrid, but it’s a lot smaller than a Citroen C5 X and there are no clever features like a 12-volt socket or some hooks for your shopping bags. As for interior cubby spaces, you get an average glovebox and some large door pockets, but that’s pretty much it other than a pair of cupholders and a small cubby under the armrest. What the Arkana lacks in interior space, it more than makes up for in standard equipment Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer What the Arkana lacks in interior space, it makes up for in standard equipment. Even entry-level Evolution models get a 7.0-inch touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto and rear parking sensors with a reversing camera, but if you step up to the Techno model you get a better-looking 9.3-inch screen. As for engines, you have a choice of one. The Arkana comes only with a 1.6-litre full hybrid. If you’re after a diesel SUV, you’re out of luck here. Take a look at the Citroen C5 Aircross instead. The 145hp hybrid system should return a claimed 60mpg, however a week with the car in a mixture of driving conditions saw us return an average of 44mpg. Behind the wheel the Arkana isn’t as sporty to drive as the styling would suggest. A Ford Kuga will put a bigger smile on your face. The suspension is also quite firm, so driving on broken roads can become tiring. The Arkana is at its best on the motorway. It’s pretty smooth at speed, however the bigger wheels on the Esprit Alpine model do generate a bit of tyre noise. The Renault Arkana may not be the most practical SUV on the market, however, it’s still worth considering if you're after a sporty-looking SUV with plenty of standard equipment and a decent price tag. Keen on making a Renault Arkana your next car? Check out the latest Renault Arkana offers available through Carwow, as well as the best deals on the Renault line-up as a whole. Plus, we've got a wide selection of used Renaults, and once you've picked your next car, you can sell your car through Carwow too.",Carwow
renault,koleos,"Is the Renault Koleos a good car? The Renault Koleos SUV is basically the same underneath as the Nissan X-Trail. However, unlike the Nissan, which has the option of seven seats, the Renault comes only as a five-seater, making it an alternative to the Skoda Kodiaq, Ford Kuga and Honda CR-V. Unsurprisingly, the Koleos looks very like Renault’s other SUV, the smaller Kadjar, at the front, but with plenty of smarter trim and chrome to reflect its position higher in the company’s range. It’s a sensation that is continued inside, where the standard sunroof makes the cabin feel nice and airy. It’s all very smart, too, and the Koleos gets Renault’s R-LINK 2 infotainment system in either seven-inch landscape form or with an 8.7-inch portrait display. The latter comes as standard on top-of-the-range models and it’s pretty to look and simple to use, although you’ll sometimes find its directions hard to follow and it’s frustrating that you have to use it to make minor adjustments to the ventilation system. Interior quality is a mixed bag, too. Although there is stitched leather on the centre console’s grab handles, as well as shiny chrome trim pieces, the plastics look and feel cheaper than you would get in a Skoda Kodiaq. What’s not open to criticism is how much space there is inside the Koleos. As Renault hasn’t had to make room for a third row of seats, all five passengers are treated to acres of head and legroom. The small hump in the floor and wide rear seats means that, even with three in the back, everyone should be happy. The seats are all comfortable and, thanks to the wide range of adjustment on the driver’s seat and steering wheel, pretty much anyone can get a good driving position. Perhaps the biggest reason for choosing the Renault Koleos over the Kadjar is the size of the boot. Even with all five seats upright, the boot will take the best part of 600 litres, which is more than enough for most families. Drop the rear seats and you have almost 2,000 litres to play with. All very impressive… I just don’t get it. Why doesn’t Renault sell a Koleos with seven seats, like the Nissan X-Trail? With only five seats, this is just a bigger, more expensive Kadjar – and, if I was picking between the two, I’d always choose the cheaper car. Mat Watson Carwow expert With that in mind, it’s no surprise that the Koleos feels like a large car to drive, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing. Unless you’re in town, you’ll only feel the worst bumps, while it’s nice and quiet inside the cabin, even at high speeds. The suspension feels quite soft, as you would expect, but the body lean is reasonably well contained unless you’re cornering very quickly. Overall, though, a Skoda Kodiaq feels sharper to drive. There are just two engines to choose from – both diesel – and the more powerful 177hp 2.0-litre model comes as standard with four-wheel drive, a combination that actually makes the Koleos pretty handy off-road. Alternatively, to make life on-road a little easier, the same engine can also be specified with a CVT automatic gearbox that shifts smoothly and doesn’t cause the annoying drone you get in other gearboxes of this type. Overall, though, unless you want four-wheel drive or an automatic, the 130hp 1.6-litre diesel feels pretty much as quick as the more powerful engine in everyday use and should return close to 50mpg if driven carefully. For most people, it’ll be the best engine to choose, especially as it’s the cheaper option in a range that looks quite expensive. On the other hand, there is some justification for the high price, as the car comes with lots of equipment as standard. That includes a full-length glass roof, sat-nav, part-leather seats, ambient lighting and cup holders that can heat or cool drinks. Last, but not least, the car also scored a full five stars in Euro NCAP safety tests, which is just what any parent will want to see in a family car. Overall, the Koleos is worth considering if you want an extremely comfortable SUV with a big boot, but don’t need seven seats. Its off-road ability and generous standard equipment are further attractions, but some of the alternatives feel better built, are more fun to drive and give you the option to specify seven seats.",Carwow
renault,zoe,"Is the Renault Zoe a good car? The Renault Zoe is a small electric car with a decent range that’s an alternative to models such as the Mini E and Peugeot e-208. The Zoe has been around for a while now, but gets regular updates, so it’s a bit like an iPhone in that it looks mostly unchanged year after year, yet contains the very latest technology. The current model’s latest updates include a few more air intakes than its predecessor – some of which help guide air past the front wheels to help reduce drag and maximise range – and a set of full-LED headlights. Renault has given the Zoe’s brake lights the LED treatment too; ditching the old car’s blue lens coating in the process. More exciting than this, however, is what lies inside. There’s a super-slick dashboard layout, a classy infotainment system and a digital driver’s display as standard. You can even get the dashboard trimmed in some whale-friendly recycled material made from old plastic bottles. EV Range Test: Honda e v Mini Electric v Peugeot e-208 v Renault Zoe v Vauxhall Corsa Electric v Volkswagen e-Up Thankfully, the Renault Zoe is really comfortable inside – in the front, at least. Those in the back will feel pretty hemmed-in if they’re close to six-feet tall and there isn’t enough shoulder room to carry three adults. Chances are, you won’t be using your dinky electric city car for lugging heavy loads. Rather, you’ll be nipping through rush-hour traffic – something the Zoe feels born to do. You get a good view forward thanks to its large windows, and the light controls make tight turns a doddle. The new Renault Zoe is capable of more than just trips to the shops, though. With its batteries fully brimmed – which takes three hours from empty using a public 22kW charger – you’ll be able to travel up to 239 miles. Charging at home using the standard 7 kWh setup will take just over nine hours. However, a 30-minute charge using a 50kW fast charger will give you 90 miles of range. This fast- charging feature is optional on the base trim and standard on the top version. The Renault Zoe doesn’t rely on gimmicks like some electric cars. Instead, it focuses on being affordable, having a good range and, being surprisingly fun to drive – for a small electric car Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer It’s pretty perky for a small car, too, so you’ll have no issue scooting away from junctions or overtaking sluggish lorries. That said, the Renault Zoe doesn’t make a particularly good motorway cruiser. Sure, its electric motor is much quieter than a petrol or diesel engine, but you’ll still hear a fair amount of wind and tyre noise at speed. You do at least get cruise control to make long journeys a bit more bearable. Another point to consider is the rather poor Euro NCAP retested safety rating it received in 2021. You shouldn’t let this put you off, though. The Renault Zoe is a very capable small electric car that comes with decent range and peppy performance, and recent updates mean you get a pretty impressive amount of standard kit, too. Just don’t go trying to carry tall adults in the back. Head over to our Renault Zoe deals page to see how much you can save or take a look at our used Renault Zoe deals.",Carwow
peugeot,208,"Is the Peugeot 208 a good car? The latest Peugeot 208 is an extensive facelift of the second-generation car, first launched in 2019. The newest model brings the car’s styling right up to date and adds an in-vogue hybrid engine as a sort of halfway house between a pure petrol model and the all-electric E-208. What it doesn’t change is what’s great about the 208 - its sense of style, lovely interior and chuckable chassis which make it a pleasure to drive. In many ways the 208 is like the designer handbag of the small hatchback world - it’s not as practical as some of the alternatives, but it’s handsome, glamorous and feels good to own. There are some really strong options available as alternatives, though. The Renault Clio is just as good-looking and offers a huge boot, nice interior and super-efficient engines. The Toyota Yaris offers a ten-year-warranty and proven hybrid engine, and the Volkswagen Polo is solid, posh and with an unmatched image. The 208’s style stands out from the crowd. It’s small, with a squat stance and intricate detailing that makes it look really glitzy even as a low-spec model. The front is dominated by Peugeot’s distinctive ‘three-claw’ LED daytime running lights, the line of which continues up into the headlights - you get a similar effect at the rear. The new Peugeot badge sits on a grille with body-coloured flashes, and round the side you even get a shortened rear window line which is a call back to the iconic 205. Inside, the 208 is the equal of any premium car in terms of its quality and design. There’s a new 10.0-inch touchscreen sat high up, with a clear display, responsive interface and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto included as standard. Material quality is high throughout, and you can feel that on the soft-touch dashboard with a woven finish or the row of piano key-style switches above the gear lever. The Peugeot 208 is the first small car to offer petrol, diesel and electric options. If you have access to charging at home or work, the EV is a superb choice Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer It’s not particularly roomy, though. A Renault Clio has a much bigger boot than the 208’s 311 litres, and a Skoda Fabia is far better for accommodating rear passengers. Even the 208’s front seats aren’t the best for very tall drivers, which is a shame. You also get Peugeot’s unique i-Cockpit layout, which means the shrunken steering wheel sits low and you view the dials over the top of it, rather than through the rim. Though this is divisive, it can be very comfortable - and the tiny wheel makes the 208 feel darty and responsive to drive. There are three engine options available for the 208. The entry-level car comes with a 1.2-litre petrol engine with a six-speed manual gearbox, or you can have a 1.2-litre hybrid automatic in two power outputs. Whichever you choose, you can expect good efficiency and a really nice refined drive. The 208 is comfortable on the motorway, feels darty and nimble around town and can even be quite fun on a twisting back road. The challenge is that a Renault Clio is arguably the more fun car and has a wider breadth of talents, while a Toyota Yaris will be even cheaper to run. But the 208 doesn’t remotely embarrass itself out on the road. If the 208 catches your eye, then you can nab yourself one for a great price by looking at our best Peugeot 208 deals.

peugeot,e-208,"Is the Peugeot E-208 a good car? The Peugeot E-208 has had a facelift, updating the all-electric hatchback with a fresh look, a bigger battery and a more powerful electric motor. This makes it a much more competitive small EV, and much easier to consider against great electric cars such as the Mini Cooper Electric, the MG4 and the Cupra Born. An immediate plus point the E-208 has going for it is its size. It’s the same size as the regular petrol 208, so it’s quite a bit smaller than most EVs. If you want something nippy and compact, perfect for city driving, the E-208 is your best bet this side of a Fiat 500 Electric. Peugeot E-208: electric range, battery and charging data Range: 217 - 245 milesEfficiency: 4.3 - 4.5 mi/kWhBattery size: 50 - 54kWhMax charge speed: 100kWCharge time AC: 0 - 100% 7hr 45mCharge time DC: 20 - 80% 25mCharge port location: Rear leftPower outputs: 136 - 156hp It’s also quite sensible and pragmatic, despite its posh outward appearance and high-tech cabin. In that regard it’s a bit like putting a fancy phone case on your work phone - yes, it looks good, but it’s all business where it counts. For 2024 Peugeot upgraded the E-208’s exterior looks. But part of the appeal is that there’s very little to mark it out as an electric car - if you didn’t spot the green flash on the number plate or the discreet ‘E’ badging, you’d think it was just a regular petrol 208. It does look smart, though, with distinctive ‘triple-claw’ LED daytime running lights front and rear, smart diamond-cut alloy wheels and even a homage to the old Peugeot 205 in the shape of its rear window. That compact silhouette hides an interior that is a bit tighter than the class best. The rear seats are quite cramped, and even the front seats aren’t the best for very tall drivers. The boot, though quite roomy at 311 litres, can’t compete with larger cars of a similar price, such as the 363-litre MG4 EV and the 385-litre Cupra Born. The E-208 is at least much more roomy than the Mini Cooper Electric - and its dashboard has a similar wow factor, too. It’s beautifully built, with lots of squashy, high-quality materials, and the 10.0-inch touchscreen that sits on the top is clear, responsive and quite easy to use. Other nice touches include the row of piano-style keys underneath the screen, while Peugeot’s i-Cockpit dial layout is present and correct - though it still won’t suit everybody’s driving position. The E-208 is a great-looking small EV which is really efficient on its battery - but you can get bigger cars with a better range for less money Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer You get a choice of two battery and motor combos. The entry-level is the same one the E-208 was offered with at launch in 2019 - a 50kWh battery and 136hp electric motor. The newer variant of this has 54kWh and 156hp to play with - not a big boost, but huge improvements in efficiency mean this is by far the best option to select. To drive, the E-208 isn’t as rapid as an MG4 or a Cupra Born, and as a result it doesn’t feel too dissimilar to the regular petrol automatic 208. It’s great to drive in town thanks to compact dimensions and quick steering, though the aforementioned MG and Cupra are more entertaining to drive on a twisty road mainly thanks to their rear-wheel drive chassis.

peugeot,2008,"Is the Peugeot 2008 a good car? The Peugeot 2008 is a small SUV with a bold look, comprising strong colour schemes and a variety of slashes and creases that make alternatives such as the Volkswagen T-Cross look more than a little tedious. If small SUVs are more rugged versions of small cars, then the Peugeot 2008 is a 208 that’s kitted out for a paintballing trip. It has the same great tech you get in the hatchback, but is better prepared for some countryside pursuits thanks to its raised ride height. And the French flair loses no momentum when you get inside, helped by a 2023 update that saw a 10.0-inch infotainment display fitted as standard. The digital driver's display (standard on all but the base model) that sits above the teeny tiny steering wheel looks great, and has a cool 3D-effect on top-spec models that works with the fancy dashboard design to offer a neat appearance that's tough to match at this price point. Not many do better than the Peugeot for front-seat room, either. It will easily accommodate two tall adults and there’s plenty of scope to move the seat and steering wheel, though lumbar adjustment – which helps keep you comfy on long drives – is only optional on top-spec versions. Back seat space is less impressive, though. Tall passengers will have their knees brushing the front seats if they’re sitting behind someone else who’s tall. On the upside, there is plenty of head and foot room. We think the best version of the Peugeot 2008 is the 130hp 1.2-litre petrol in GT trim, as it's stylish and the engine is well-suited to the family SUV Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer In the boot, the 2008 has 434 litres to work with, which is better than the Skoda Kamiq and Seat Arona, but falls short of the Volkswagen T-Cross and Ford Puma. Hit the road and you’ll find the 2008 is a great all-rounder. Its steering is light in town, but weights up to give you more confidence at faster speeds. The slick six-speed manual gearbox (top-spec models get an eight-speed automatic) is the perfect match for the Peugeot’s sporty small steering wheel, though that's where the sportiness ends. It's relatively fun on a winding road, but it's happier taking things easy. The most powerful engine helps make it a bit more enjoyable, though. It has 130hp and is both sprightly and cheap to run. The manual Allure version is a bit more economical than the automatic GT, but official figures make the entry level 100hp engine the cheapest to run. But what makes the 2008 stand out from alternatives is its eye-catching styling that proves cheap-to-run and practical family cars can still be desirable. For that reason alone, it’s worth shortlisting against cars like the Seat Arona and VW T-Cross. And, of course, the 2008 is available in fully electric E-2008 form.

peugeot,e-2008,"Is the Peugeot E-2008 a good car? If you want a small electric SUV that’s stylish inside and out without sacrificing comfort and practicality, the Peugeot E-2008 is worthy of a spot on your shortlist. The latest model can go a bit further between charges than before too. There are plenty of alternatives at the more affordable end of the electric SUV market, including the MG ZS EV, Volvo EX30 and Vauxhall Mokka Electric, for example. There’s also the Citroen e-C4 and Kia Niro EV, both of which have smart designs – but the E-2008’s chic, upmarket appeal has them all licked. It’s a bit like wearing a Hermès outfit on the catwalk, rather than something from a high street chain. Its fancy styling has some cool details, such as the claw-like running lights in the lower bumper that give it a unique face, while the front grille has upmarket body-coloured inserts on all but the lowest trim. At the back there are LED lights and the Peugeot name is scrawled across the bootlid. Hop inside and you’ll find the style taps are left to flow. A wraparound dashboard is a nice addition, plus there are plenty of high-quality materials used throughout. You’ll have to search hard for anything that feels properly cheap, and there's a big infotainment display that's a bit easier to use than the one in older models, but still not up there with the best. The digital driver’s display is bigger and better than before, too. However, Peugeot’s commitment to having the dials sit above the small wheel means that you’ll find the view of them blocked in some seating positions. Sounds like a minor point, but it’s worth giving it a go before committing to buying an E-2008. Unlike some electric cars which are built from the ground up as battery-powered cars, the E-2008 is based on the petrol-powered 2008. That, unfortunately, results in a hefty hump in the rear seats where you would find mechanical bits in that model, which middle-seat passengers will have to straddle. Those sat in the outer seats will also find kneeroom isn’t great, while taller drivers might find their hair brushes against the bit where the roof meets the door. Sure, the Peugeot E-2008 looks great inside and out, but we also love how comfortable it is compared with other electric SUVs Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer On the plus side, the boot has no load lip so it’s dead easy to get stuff in and out of, plus its square shape makes it easy to play cargo-loading Tetris. With 435 litres of space to use, it’s fairly good but not massive. The e-C4 and Mokka Electric have less, but the Niro EV can carry more stuff. Spend a bit more and you can have a Skoda Enyaq, which has a massive boot. An update in 2023 increased the E-2008's range from 217 miles to 250 miles, improving the old car's key weakness. That's a useful distance between charges, however, for the cash you can go further in the Kia and a similarly priced MG, while the Citroen and Vauxhall are getting the same battery upgrades as the Peugeot to offer similar range. As well as this single battery option, there’s just one motor option for the E-2008. It’s now 156hp, which is a bit more than before. However, despite having more power it’s very much designed to offer leisurely performance, even if you pop the car into its sportiest settings. Sportiness is not the E-2008’s raison d'etre, though. It can be quite fun to steer down a winding road, but it’s much happier cruising along the motorway or in town, where it soaks up bumps with little fuss. This is a very relaxing and comfortable electric SUV to drive. The Peugeot E-2008 is a real head-turner, and backs this up with a lovely interior, too. Rear seat space is limited and boot capacity is so-so, though the square space does make it more useful. The improved electric range is welcome, too, if still not quite up with the best you can get for this money. Interested?

peugeot,308,"Is the Peugeot 308 a good car? The Peugeot 308 could be right up your street if you want your next family hatchback to really stand out in a sea of restrained-looking alternatives such as the VW Golf and Ford Focus. It's like taking all your practical work clothes and updating them with sparkly accessories. Just take a look at that front end. It looks like Peugeot’s taken the 308 and dipped it face-first in a bucket of leftover Christmas decorations. Shiny daytime chrome, bright running lights and LED lamps are everywhere, along with a brand-new shield-shaped Peugeot badge. Somehow, though, these bits of car jewellery work together to make the 308 look more upmarket than most other small family hatches, such as the Skoda Octavia or SEAT Leon. It’s a similar story at the back, where Peugeot has added some bright red brake-light slashes to the bootlid and a set of shiny chrome exhaust trims to the bumper. Although, peer closer and those square pipes are just plastic add-ons. Thankfully, there’s little of this fakery inside the Peugeot’s cabin. If a surface looks nice (and most of them look terrific) it’ll almost certainly feel equally plush, too. This applies to everything from the soft dashboard trim and the solid centre console, and to the flashy metal-effect trim around the air vents. These vents sit right at the top of the dashboard, beside a high-mounted driver’s display that replaces old-fashioned analogue dials. This looks very similar to the setup you get in the smaller 208 and larger 3008 SUV, and means you peer over the steering wheel to read your speed rather than through it. The steering wheel itself is much smaller than in most cars and sits in your lap rather than at arm’s length. It’s an odd layout that’s tricky to get a good driving position with. Very lofty passengers might also struggle slightly to get comfy in the Peugeot 308’s back seats, but there’s plenty of space for kids to get comfy and the boot can easily swallow a family’s luggage for a weekend away. The Peugeot 308 is a comfortable family hatchback that, in typical French fashion, majors on chic style appeal. Its unconventional interior layout may take some getting used to, however Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Speaking of which, the Peugeot 308 is comfortable to drive for long periods, and cruises along happily at motorway speeds. If long drives are a common occurrence, you’ll want to check out the 308’s 1.5-litre diesel engine. It’s not particularly pokey, but is mostly quiet and returns around 50mpg in normal driving conditions without any great effort. If you aren’t planning any particularly long road-trips, you’ll be better off with one of the 308’s petrol or plug-in hybrid engines. There's also an electric version, called e-308, so you really can have it whichever way you please. The 1.2-litre petrol has more than enough power for town driving and country roads, while the hybrid is nippier and more economical – so long as you have somewhere to charge its battery up regularly. Both versions are easy to drive, quiet and comfortable. All Peugeot 308s are easy to see out of and the dinky steering wheel helps make light work of tight inner-city manoeuvres. Speaking of which, every version comes with rear-parking sensors as standard and you can pay extra for higher-spec cars with adaptive cruise control to help take the sting out of long motorway trips. That said, even entry-level cars come with plenty of equipment as standard, which helps justify their slightly steeper price tag than some less flashy family hatchbacks. If you’re looking for something that’ll stand out but don’t fancy a high-riding SUV, then the new Peugeot 308 is well worth a look. If you’re keen on this stylish family car, you can check out Carwow’s Peugeot 308 deals to see how much you could save.

peugeot,e-308,"Is the Peugeot e-308 a good car? Think of the new Peugeot e-308 as the concluding part of a trilogy: you can already buy a conventionally powered 308 and a plug-in hybrid, but now there’s a fully electric car to complete the set. The electric version is the most expensive of the three, which is to be expected as an electric car, but it’s also more expensive than most of the other battery-powered hatchbacks you might consider, such as the Volkswagen ID3, Citroen e-C4 and Renault Megane E-Tech. And that’s for the five-door hatchback; there’s also an e-308 SW, which is something of a rarity as there aren’t many electric estate cars. What do you get for your money? Well, aside from the usual 308 good stuff – stylish looks and an upmarket cabin – the entry-level Allure model comes with 18-inch alloy wheels, heated front seats and steering wheel, and satellite navigation is standard along with a rear-view camera. Safety kit includes autonomous emergency braking and adaptive cruise control to hold a safe distance from the vehicle in front. GT models are about £2,000 more, adding full matrix LED headlights, 3D LED taillights, a GT-specific grille, and wider sills to add more aggression to the looks. The seats are trimmed with soft Alcantara, there’s aluminium trim on the dash and door panels, and you get front parking sensors. The 3D digital instrument cluster is a neat touch that adds cool factor to the cabin. For a short period, there’s also a limited-run First Edition. This costs a fraction less than the GT and has an exclusive interior with upholstery that combines cloth, synthetic leather and Alcantara. The e-308 isn’t the cheapest route into an electric hatchback, but it’s got plenty of high-quality appeal Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer All three trim levels share the same electric motor and battery. The motor has 156hp, which should be enough for brisk rather than exciting performance – you won’t be keeping up with a Tesla Model 3, that’s for sure. The 54kWh battery offers an official range of up to 250 miles, though the higher-spec car manages a couple of miles less due to its larger alloy wheels. That’s a little behind the Volkswagen ID3 Pro’s 266-mile range, despite the fact the Peugeot comes with a heat pump as standard to improve efficiency. Using that 250 miles of range is a generally pleasant experience. The e-308 manages to be comfortable around town, yet still has a bit of fun about it when the road goes twisty. But only up to a point. For an electric car, it's not very punchy at all, with only 156hp on offer where 200hp is more of a base level for electric hatchbacks these days. It's fine, just feels a bit sluggish if you've ever driven any of those VW, Cupra, MG or Renault alternatives that pack a bit more power and therefore a more impressive acceleration. When you do need to stop and recharge, the e-308 is capable of topping up its batteries from 20-80% in about 30 minutes using a 100kW rapid charger. A full charge from a 7.4kW home wallbox takes seven hours and 20 minutes. So, is the Peugeot e-308 a good car? Well, the regular Peugeot 308 earned score of 8/10 on Carwow, so it’s off to a strong start, but there’s no getting away from the fact it costs more than the talented alternatives listed above, and can’t go quite as far as the best electric hatchbacks on a full charge. But the interior quality is a step above the likes of the VW ID3, Vauxhall Astra Electric or MG 4, and it’s an all-round high-quality experience.

peugeot,308-sw,"Is the Peugeot 308 SW a good car? If you like the look of the Peugeot 308 but need a bit more space, the 308 SW estate could be the right car for you. With the larger boot space and a higher roof line, it’s considerably more practical than the hatchback and goes up against the likes of the Vauxhall Astra Sports Tourer, Volkswagen Golf Estate and Skoda Octavia Estate. It’s a lot like one of the big blue Ikea bags – it’s large, practical and it stands out from the crowd. The Peugeot’s a bit more fashionable, though. The exterior design incorporates a rather large grille with the new Peugeot shield at the centre and the headlights blended into the edges. The car also has fang-like daytime running lights that add extra detail to the front, while you get sharp lines and cool alloy wheel designs down the side. The SW’s rear lights have a 3D effect to them, while you also get more creases and thick cladding on the bumper. Inside, you’ll find Peugeot’s iCockpit concept. You get two 10.0-inch displays – one for the instruments and the other for the touchscreen infotainment – as well as comfort seats, sport pedals, gloss black trim, a small steering wheel and interesting materials on the dashboard. Room in the rear seats isn’t the best though. Unlike the spacious feeling you get up front, the rear seats are a bit cramped for adults, with head and knee room a little tight. The 308 SW also doesn’t have the widest door openings to fit child seats, and you then have to poke around in the seat base to attach the seat to the Isofix anchor points. It’s stand-out styling, good levels of equipment and decent efficiency make the 308 SW a good option in the estate market Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Conversely, boot space is pretty good. You get 608 litres in the standard SW, while the plug-in hybrid alternative’s area drops to 548 litres. That’s bigger than its chassis mate, the Vauxhall Astra Sports Tourer, and just pips the Volkswagen Golf Estate. It does lose out to the Skoda Octavia though. You can choose from a petrol, diesel or two plug-in hybrids – all of which are paired to an eight-speed automatic transmission. Both PHEVs can offer 40 miles of electric range, which can be held so you can use it when you need it. In town, the 308 SW feels a little juddery when going over bumps and the engine feels a little out of breath when you initially get going. But you get decent visibility all-round and the steering is quite light to make manoeuvring simple. On a long motorway cruise, the 308 SW comes into its own. The lack of comfort in town is swapped for a smooth ride at higher speeds, while all the engines will get you up to speed easily enough. While the lighter steering works well in town, it feels quite remote when you go on a twisty road. Sure that’s not what the 308 SW is made for, but it feels a little out of its comfort zone. The suspension soaks up the bumps okay, but you can expect some body roll. With a near class-leading boot and stylish looks, the Peugeot 308 SW is a decent estate car in many respects – but its interior space might not suit you. If you want the latest deals on the Peugeot 308 SW or other new Peugeot models, go through carwow, where you can also get used deals on Peugeots.

peugeot,e-308-sw,"Is the Peugeot e-308 SW a good car? The Peugeot e-308 SW is one of those rare things - a fully electric estate car. Together with the mechanically identical Vauxhall Astra Sports Tourer Electric, it joins the bargain-basement MG5 EV and the Porsche Taycan Sport Turismo as the only such models on sale in the UK. Most car companies have so far preferred to sink their investment into electric SUVs, but an electric estate car has many benefits - it’s still very practical for a family, but being lower to the ground and lighter is more efficient than a tall, heavy SUV, and can therefore eke out that extra bit of range from the battery pack. A bit like Betamax, it’s a good idea that has a bit of an uphill struggle to compete with the flavour of the month - though unlike Betamax, it doesn’t look like the e-308 SW will be a total failure. In fact, it’s quite a likeable car, especially when you get inside. Like all current Peugeots, the e-308 SW has an interior that feels stylish, upmarket and packed with technology. A 10.0-inch touchscreen and digital instrument panel make it feel suitably up-to-date, but it’s the little features that make it feel premium - the posh-feeling toggle switches under the central screen, for example, or the big swathe of fabric running across the dashboard and the tops of the doors. Some drivers might not get on with Peugeot’s i-Cockpit setup, which places the instrument cluster high up above a shrunken steering wheel - which you look over, rather than through. You might find you need to lower the wheel more than you’re comfortable with to see the dials properly, so it could be worth taking a test drive to make sure you can get on with it. Peugeot e-308 SW: electric range, battery and charging data Range: 248 milesEfficiency: 4.1 miles per kWhBattery size: 51kWhMax charge speed: 100kWCharge time AC: 7hrs 30 mins, 0-100%, 7kWCharge time DC: 30 mins, 0-80%, 100kWCharge port location: Left rearPower output: 156hp Regardless of size you should have no trouble getting on with the e-308 SW’s practicality. Its 548-litre boot is huge, being long and wide with a completely flat floor when you fold the seats down. It’s ideal for big shops, trips to the flat-pack furniture store or the occasional tip run, and should be able to accommodate even a big pushchair with ease. Rear legroom isn’t quite as generous, but it’s sufficient for a six-foot adult - and the equal of any of the compact electric SUVs you might be considering as an alternative, like a Kia Niro EV or Volkswagen ID3. If it were a few thousand pounds cheaper the Peugeot e-308 SW would be an easy recommendation - but it’s more expensive than a Tesla Model 3 Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Peugeot is keen that its electric cars should feel no different to its petrol or diesel ones, so the e-308 SW is made to be as similar to the regular 308 as possible. To that end, you don’t get a particularly whizzy electric motor or bags and bags of power like some alternatives. A fairly modest power output here means excellent efficiency, allowing the e-308’s comparatively small battery to still provide a competitive range of up to 248 miles. That does mean, though, that if you want zippy performance - or a longer range - you’ll need to look elsewhere, as Peugeot only offers the one powertrain. It might also sting that the e-308 SW’s comparatively modest performance comes at an asking price several thousand pounds more than faster and longer-range contemporaries.

peugeot,408,"Is the Peugeot 408 a good car? The Peugeot 408 is the car you buy when you just can’t decide between a sleek saloon and a chunky SUV, as it’s basically the half-way point between the two. It has some of the ground clearance and plastic cladding of an SUV, but the low roofline and sleek shape of a saloon, and it kind of looks like an elephant has sat on a Lamborghini Urus. All of this means that it’s a bit tricky to work out where the 408 fits among alternatives you might be considering. The Honda Civic is around the same price, but the Peugeot is roomier. The Skoda Octavia is much more practical, but also much more conventional. Perhaps the semi-SUV likes of the Cupra Formentor and Renault Rafale make for a better comparison, as does the Citroen C5 X, which shares a chassis and engines with the 408, and which is similarly tricky to pigeon-hole. It’s almost daring in its style, but not all of what’s on show works. We like the pert rear end with the built-in spoiler, and the expressive headlights, but some of the chunky SUV-bits lower down on the body look quite awkward. Equally, if you go for the basic 17-inch alloy wheels, the 408 can look as if it’s been fitted with the wheels from a supermarket trolley — go for the optional 19-inch rims, or even the 20-inch wheels. The front end is pretty striking, with the body-coloured grille and the slashing LED running lights, but even so it’s hard to see the 408 as a coherent whole — it’s like lots of different cars all mixed into one, and they’re all fighting for supremacy. The cabin is a much quieter affair, and it shares a lot with the likes of the Peugeot 308 hatchback. The 408 does seem to have had a boost in quality though, and with the sweeping layout and the high-quality materials, you’d not be disappointed if you hopped out of a Volkswagen, or even an Audi, and straight into a 408. The infotainment system is good, too, thanks to a layout that’s easy enough to find your way around. There’s a handy set of digital buttons, which are shortcuts to the functions you need, and you can customise the layout of those shortcuts to your taste. There’s also wireless connections for Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, but it’s still annoying that you have to go into a separate on-screen menu for the climate control. Bring back buttons, please. The Peugeot 408’s cabin is fantastic, and more than a match for what you get from more premium brands Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The front seats are really good, but you should definitely take a test drive before buying as not everyone can get their driving position to match up with Peugeot’s small steering wheel and high-set instruments. The wheel is supposed to sit low down, while you look at the instruments over the top, but you might find that the wheel gets in the way of some of the dials. Space up front is decent, with storage areas under the armrest and door bins that are lined to avoid rattles. There are two big cup holders, and space in the back is surprisingly good, even with that low roof. It’s a little narrow, though, so the 408 is really a four-seater, as the middle rear seat is close to useless. You can choose from two plug-in hybrid versions, which should appeal to company car buyers with their low official CO2 ratings, but the company car tax system is changing this year, so business buyers might be better off waiting for the all-electric E-408 to arrive, with its 280-mile range. There’s also a basic 1.2-litre petrol hybrid version, which isn’t as powerful but feels sweeter to drive than the PHEV versions simply because it’s lighter. Given the 408’s ride height, you’d expect it to have a softly-softly SUV-style way over bumps, but it’s actually surprisingly stiff. It’s fine around town, but there’s a good bit of noise from both the suspension and the tyres on bigger roads, which makes the 408 less comfortable when cruising. The standard hybrid is slightly better off in this respect than the plug-in versions, which again is mostly down to its weight.

peugeot,e-408,"Is the Peugeot E-408 a good car? The Peugeot E-408 is the new electric version of the 408, a swoopy saloon/coupé/pseudo-SUV. It’s a bit like a Picasso painting; there’s a lot going on wherever you look, but it all comes together to make something rather striking. It’s yet another entrant into the coupé-SUV market, making it an alternative to the Renault Rafale, Citroen C5 X, Cupra Formentor and the Ford Mustang Mach-E. It may not be a ‘classically’ handsome design, but it’s hard to deny that the E-408 is a stylish car; even if it’s in an unconventional way. Peugeot is definitely showing some of its old ways with its current range, and the E-408 brings with it some additional French flair. Aggressive, pointy headlights and a ‘gradient’ grille give the E-408 a sporty nose, whilst at the back you’ll find a little flick-up spoiler above a pseudo-light bar and a rather large diffuser-style bumper trim. The fastback-style sloping roof and angular shoulder line give the jacked-up coupe a purposeful stance. Peugeot E-408: electric range, battery and charging data Range: 281 MilesEfficiency: 3.5-4.5 miles per kWhBattery size: 58kWhMax charge speed: 100kWCharge time AC: 5hrs20mins, 0-100%, 11kWhCharge time DC: 35mins, 20-80%, 100kWhCharge port location: Left Side RearPower outputs: 210hp The angular design theme continues inside the E-408, with a dashboard design that’s much less curvy than any alternatives. That’s not a critique though, in fact the multimedia display and control buttons facing the driver give the cockpit a real fighter-jet vibe; as does the small squared-off steering wheel perched below the driver display. Be warned though, some drivers might find that the steering wheel gets in the way of the driver’s screen if you set it too high so bear that in mind when getting comfy in the driver’s seat. Just like its petrol and hybrid stablemates, the E-408’s cabin will be full of posh, soft-touch materials and good standard kit. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto should be all you need these days, but if you’re a fan of manufacturer systems then Peugeot’s own ‘i-Connect’ infotainment system is a great one to use. The Peugeot E-408 may not quite fit into one category of car, but it’s still a practical and family-friendly choice with a great interior Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The rakish roofline would suggest that rear seat and boot space is compromised but you’d be surprised. Boot space is less than a petrol-powered 408 but the same as the 408 hybrid, whilst rear seat space is likely to be the same too. Expect adequate head room for adults in the back, even if it is a little cosy for shoulder space. When it comes to performance, the E-408 is no slouch but don’t go expecting lap records either. A 210hp motor and 58kWh battery promises up to 281 miles of range which is similar to what alternatives can manage. The E-408 can go from 20-80% charge in 30 minutes on a 100kW rapid charger, which is okay, if not fantastic We’ll have a full review for you as soon as we get our hands on this swoopy-looking electric car, but in the meantime you can get ahead on Carwow’s Peugeot E-408 deals.

peugeot,3008,"Is the Peugeot 3008 a good car? Peugeot’s 3008 has shot up the ranks since the first one was launched more than a decade ago. It may have started as a tall (and somewhat ugly) crossover, but now it’s a fully-fledged SUV-coupe, with really stylish looks and much more high-tech kit. It’s like someone who used to be a bit podgy, but has hit the gym and overhauled their wardrobe. While the all-electric version, the E-3008, might get all the headlines, a big chunk of the 3008’s sales in the UK will be taken by this, the hybrid model — not least because, in spite of all the new on-board technology, it’s a fairly handy £10,000 less expensive than the E-3008… That being said, there are plenty of compelling alternatives to the Peugeot 3008, many of which are a bit more affordable. Some of the best all-rounders include the Nissan Qashqai, Kia Sportage and Hyundai Tucson. Then there's the practical, great value Citroen C5 Aircross and stylish but impractical Toyota C-HR to consider, too. Power for the 3008 Hybrid comes from a 134bhp 1.2-litre three-cylinder petrol engine — that’s the same one that Peugeot has been making for donkey’s years, but it’s been upgraded for life as a hybrid. The system sort of sits between a ‘traditional’ Toyota-style full hybrid and a mild-hybrid. So, the 3008 Hybrid can drive itself on electric power alone, but only for very short bursts at very low speeds. It’s good for around town, but less useful on long motorway hauls. Peugeot reckons you’ll get 51mpg out of it, and CO2 emissions are kept to a trim 124g/km. Inside, there’s a huge, sweeping all-digital 21.0-inch screen that dominates the cabin. It sits up and away from the driver, almost resting against the windscreen. As is Peugeot’s recent tradition, the steering wheel is small, hexagonal, and sits more or less in your lap. We've tried it in the E-3008 and it's much easier to find a comfortable driving position where the wheel doesn't block the instrument display than ever before, but it's probably still worth trying before you buy. The 3008 is now a fully-fledged SUV-coupe, with really stylish looks and much more high-tech kit Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer To the right of the steering wheel is a slim touchpad which has configurable shortcut buttons for the big screen so that you can access the menus you need more easily, but sadly Peugeot insists on putting all of the climate control functions on the screen, which makes it more fiddly than it needs to be. The gear lever is now a chunky toggle switch behind the steering wheel, so that leaves the centre console free for cupholders and storage spaces, of which there are loads, and the 3008’s mixture of back-lighting and soft fabric surfaces on the dashboard make for a cabin that’s almost good enough to challenge the mighty Germans on quality, and surpass them on design. In spite of that rakish roof, there’s good space in the back seats, even for grown-ups, although those with longer legs will find that their feet and knees sit up a bit too high, as the floor has been raised up to make space for the electric version’s battery pack. The boot is a useful 520 litres, but that sloping roofline makes loading in really bulky items a bit of a challenge, and alternatives such as the Hyundai Tucson have a larger capacity. Speaking of that roofline, the Peugeot 3008 is a really good-looking thing. It manages to be imposingly chunky while also sporting sleek lines and cool details such as Peugeot's signature three-claw light designs. Stick with Carwow if you want the best Peugeot 3008 deals.

peugeot,e-3008,"Is the Peugeot E-3008 a good car? The Peugeot E-3008 is one of the most distinctive-looking cars on the market today. While the latest generation has sacrificed some practicality for the sake of its swoopy looks, it’s a very accomplished family car under the skin. It’s like a pair of Ray-Ban sunglasses; still does the same job as a pair of petrol station specials, but it’s a bit posher and more interesting to look at. And again, as with a pair of designer sunglasses, there are other stylish alternatives to consider; the hybrid Renault Rafale, minimalist Tesla Model Y, retro-futuristic Hyundai Ioniq 5 and swoopy Volkswagen ID.5 to name a few. Though only the Ioniq 5 comes close to having as much road presence as the E-3008. It’s a fascinating mix of crisp angles, intricate details and big, bold surfaces. The roofline is oh-so rakish, and there’s even a little flick-up spoiler on the boot edge; Peugeot’s done a bang-up job with the styling. Peugeot E-3008: electric range, battery and charging data Range: 304 - 435 milesEfficiency: 4.2 - 4.5 miles per kWhBattery size: 73kWh, 97kWhMax charge speed: 160kWCharge time AC: 10hr 30mins, 0-100% at 7kWCharge time DC: 30 mins, 20-80% at 160kWCharge port location: Left side rearPower outputs: 210hp, 230hp, 320hp And the interior is just as impressive, looking as though it were designed with a ruler or a set square - in a good way - and there’s a clever use of fabric to mask harder plastics. The dashboard wraps around the driver, with a crisp 21.0-inch widescreen display housing both the infotainment and instrument cluster. Some thoughtful touches include a touchscreen shortcut bar under the middle air vents, and a secondary haptic climate control shortcut bar below it. While there’s standard Apple CarPlay/Android Auto connectivity, it is frustrating that you need to navigate away from them to adjust the climate settings. There’s plenty of room and adjustability to get comfortable in the front, even with Peugeot’s quirky small steering wheel, and rear passengers won’t feel hard done by for head space - even with the sloping roofline. Rear knee room is tight, but there’s a handy 520-litre boot capacity, though alternatives such as the Model Y and ID.5 have more cargo space. The E-3008 is rather efficient, with a claimed range of up to 435 miles depending on which trim and battery size you go for. You’ll likely see around 80% of that range in the real world, which isn’t bad going, but there is a hybrid 3008 available if you prefer petrol power. The Peugeot E-3008 is as handsome inside as it is outside, but it’s not quite as good to drive as it looks Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer On the road, the E-3008 doesn’t quite match the precedent set by its sporty styling. It has tight, darty steering and a responsive throttle in sport mode, but it doesn’t feel all that comfortable being hustled down a country lane. It can feel unsettled with quick direction changes, and there’s almost zero feel from the brake pedal which is disconcerting. The dual-motor 325hp version feels more sure footed thanks to its four-wheel drive system, and it is quick, but it’s not quite the high-performance drive that Peugeot suggests it is. All versions are hugely comfortable though, soaking up bad roads with ease around town and sitting at a whisper-quiet cruise on the motorway - though the sharp steering can be a little jarring when making lane changes at high speeds. Still, the E-3008 is fantastic as a comfortable, stylish cruiser, and you can have a look at new E-3008 deals through Carwow. There are also E-3008 lease deals, and used Peugeot E-3008 deals through our trusted network of dealers.

peugeot,5008,"Is the Peugeot 5008 a good car? The Peugeot 5008 is the bigger, seven-seat sibling of the Peugeot 3008. It has the same underpinnings as that car - same engines, hybrid systems, and even most of the same interior. But it’s larger, with more space in the cabin and a much bigger boot. It’s like swapping jackets for one that looks the same but has massive hidden pockets. We like it so much the Peugeot 5008 received a Highly Commended award in the Family Values category at the 2025 Carwow Car of the Year Awards. It certainly cuts a rug, and makes a stylish alternative to the likes of the Skoda Kodiaq, Hyundai Santa Fe and Nissan X-Trail. There is a fully electric Peugeot E-5008, which we’ve reviewed separately, but this page will focus on the simpler and more affordable hybrid and plug-in hybrid models. At the front, the 5008 shares its style with the smaller 3008. There’s a huge body-coloured grille which stretches across the whole front of the car, flanked by LED daytime running lights which are meant to look as though a lion (Peugeot’s mascot) has slashed the front of the car with its claws. Though it’s not exactly pretty, the effect is striking and it stands out in a world of anonymous-looking family SUVs such as the Volkswagen Tiguan. Further back, the 5008 gets a much squarer roofline than the dramatically sloping 3008. It’s quite blocky, but that’s necessary to provide good headroom for the occupants of the third row of seats - and a bigger boot when it’s folded away. It certainly pays off, as the middle row of seats has way more space for heads, knees and feet than you get in the 3008. You also get three individual rear seats which split and fold in a 40:20:40 arrangement, making it much more flexible for balancing passengers and load space. As with all modern Peugeots, the 5008 has a lovely interior, and this model having seven seats makes it super-practical as a large family car Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The third row has space for adults for very short trips - though kids will be more comfortable back there. Even the 5008’s 348-litre boot (with all the seats up) is pretty reasonable, but with just five seats in place you get a mammoth 916 litres of space, which is bigger than the Hyundai Santa Fe or the Skoda Kodiaq. Front-seat passengers are well catered-for too, with a dashboard that goes hard on high-tech features. There’s a huge screen setup that stretches right across the top of the dash and covers off driver information and infotainment, plus a configurable panel of ‘i-Toggles’ which lets you set customisable shortcuts to almost any of the car’s functions. There’s no question that it looks good, even if the styling is a little busy, and it feels great too. The plastics are high quality and much of the dash is covered in fabric, giving it a softer, sofa-like feel that’s very luxurious. Engine options are both hybrid - there’s a 136hp 1.2-litre which sounds as though it’s going to be way too weedy, but actually copes well even with a fully-loaded car. If you’d prefer something a little more effortless, there’s a 196hp plug-in hybrid which can manage up to 48 miles of fully electric range and promises super-low fuel bills if you keep it topped up. Regardless of engine, the 5008 is comfortable to drive, though shelve any expectations you might have that this model has anything to do with the brand’s Peugeot Sport division. Despite the supportive seats and sporty steering wheel, the 5008 is not set up to be fun in the corners - instead, it’s easy and relaxing to drive.

peugeot,e-5008,"Is the Peugeot E-5008 a good car? There are very few seven-seater electric SUVs on sale at the moment, and the majority of them are really rather pricey. Like a pair of Zara jeans, the Peugeot E-5008 looks just as stylish as its more expensive alternatives, but for a fraction of the price. Considering that the E-5008 is over £10,000 less than the Kia EV9, it looks like pretty good value, and it’s around £35,000 less than the Volvo EX90; yet the Peugeot might just be the more stylish car. Much like its smaller E-3008 counterpart, the E-5008 is one of the most striking cars on sale - period. It's a kaleidoscope of crisp lines and sharp corners, with an enormous grille and the signature lion claw headlight design. It may not have the swoopy roofline and compact rear end of the E-3008, but the E-5008 has just as much road presence - and a lot more practicality. Peugeot E-5008: electric range, battery and charging data Range: 310-414 milesEfficiency: 3.5 - 4.3mi/kWhBattery size: 73kWh, 97kWhMax charge speed: 160kWCharge time AC: 4hrs, 20-80%, 11kWCharge time DC: 30mins, 20-80%, 160kWCharge port location: Left side rearPower outputs: 210hp, 230hp, 320hp The interior carries the angular theme into the car, with a fabric-trimmed wraparound dashboard, slick 21-inch widescreen infotainment-and-instrument display and a funky two-spoke steering wheel beneath it. The infotainment display isn’t just good to look at, but it’s fairly easy to use too. A secondary display underneath the air vents has customisable touchscreen buttons, while there’s another row of haptic controls beneath it. It’s just a shame that all of the shortcuts direct you back to the main screen, because while you can use Peugeot’s own infotainment at the same time as the climate controls, you have to totally exit Apple CarPlay or Android Auto to change the temperature. Frustrating. What isn’t frustrating is just how practical the E-5008 is, with lots of storage around the cabin and plenty of space across the front two rows. Tall adults won’t struggle for headroom or legroom behind a tall driver, for example, and up front there are two cubbies in the centre console as well as a wireless charging pad for your phone. Unfortunately the third-row of seats isn’t all that spacious, and it’s best reserved for children or short journeys. You’ll fit six adults under six-foot across all three rows, but it’ll feel a little claustrophobic in the back after a while. While it’s not an EV, the Volkswagen Tayron has more space inside. The Peugeot E-5008 blends stylish design with proper practicality, but it's let down by its infotainment and brakes Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer As a seven-seater, you still get some cargo space - about the same size as a small hatchback - which will easily take some shopping or a few backpacks. With the third row of seats stowed away there’s an enormous 915-litre boot; long trips away will be no bother with that much space for luggage in the back. Long trips away are a real option in the E-5008 too, because you have a claimed 310 miles of range in the single and dual-motor small battery models. That shoots up to a very impressive 403 miles in the bigger battery, long-range car, and the E-5008 is an excellent choice to take on a long road trip; it’s exceptionally quiet and comfortable on the move. Around town it’s easy to manoeuvre for its size, and its suspension does a superb job of absorbing bumps and blows, but it’s on the motorway where it impresses most with minimal wind and road noise and a pillowy-soft ride at speed. Country lanes aren’t fun though, even in the dual-motor model with its firmer suspension, and while the E-5008 feels capable it’s best driven along at a steady pace. As a practical, comfortable and stylish family car it makes for a strong contender, and we’ve got some great new Peugeot E-5008 deals here on Carwow. We’ve also got Peugeot E-5008 lease deals, and there are used Peugeot E-5008s available through our network of trusted dealers.

peugeot,e-rifter,"Is the Peugeot e-Rifter a good car? If you’re in the market for a family MPV with an all-electric powertrain and loads of interior space, the Peugeot e-Rifter may be the car you’re after. While it might not be the most enticing-looking thing, it has all the attributes for those who need to lug things or people around regularly. As long as it’s within a reasonably short distance. The e-Rifter is a bit like a lightweight Cesna aircraft. Sure it’s great at shorter distances and very good at that. But you’ll be making plenty of stops if you want to go on any long-distance trips. It shares underpinnings with the Citroen e-Berlingo and Vauxhall Combo Life Electric, so if it looks familiar that could be why. Unlike the VW ID Buzz, which is a style icon, the e-Rifter ranks among the more reserved offerings. It’s slab-sided and won’t be winning any design awards, but has a smart face that will be pleasing to some. The cabin also isn’t the most exciting, but it has got either blue or orange sections to brighten up the otherwise black and grey finish. You get Peugeot’s funky iCockpit setup, while there are loads of storage bins and cubbies to hold your things, which makes for a very practical cabin. Rear space is also pretty good, while the boot is well-sized, although you’ll have to contend with a large tailgate, so make sure you don’t park too close to anything at the back. It’s not the nicest-feeling cabin though, as durability is the keyword with the e-Rifter. Scratchy plastics cover a lot of the surfaces, while the compact steering wheel is only leather-covered in the GT version. For the additional space, the long-wheelbase e-Rifter is a practical town car. Shame it doesn’t have the battery capacity for longer distance Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer As with the cabin, the drive system is pretty underwhelming. You get a 50kWh battery pack paired to a front-mounted electric motor – and that’s on both the standard or long-wheelbase version. But on both, the official range of 172 miles isn’t likely to be enough for most families – especially if longer journeys are likely to be part of the mix. On such lengthier runs, efficiency isn’t great. Being boxy in shape, the e-Rifter doesn’t cut through the air very well, so you get a lot of wind noise. You also run through your battery quickly, and we found you’re more likely to go not much further than 100 miles on motorway drives. The e-Rifter is better suited to life off the motorway. With its lighter steering and large windows all-around, you have good credentials for town family runaround. The electric motor gets you up to speed quickly enough, while the option of regenerative braking to recoup charge helps negotiate slower moving traffic – although the car won’t come to a stop on its own due to the lack of a one-pedal drive mode. Vans aren’t great to drive on twistier roads, and the e-Rifter conforms to that stereotype. It feels cumbersome as the electric motor is only just powerful enough, but it doesn’t lean too much in bends as the batteries are mounted in the floor to help with stability. While it may have some major drawbacks, the Peugeot e-Rifter is better suited to people needing a large car for around town and who don’t need to venture too far from home with it. It also isn’t too pricey, especially against the Volkswagen ID. Buzz. Plus it has the option of seven seats – a rare asset among smaller EVs. And if you want to get a great deal on the e-Rifter, check out carwow, where you can also browse offers on the latest Peugeot models as well.

peugeot,e-traveller,"Is the Peugeot e-Traveller a good car? The large and boxy Peugeot e-Traveller can’t hide its van origins on the outside, but its interior looks and feels much like a contemporary family car. With the added benefit of tons of space and plenty of configurability. You can decide on the number and layout of the seats as well as standard and long wheelbase versions. This is essentially a customisable chest of drawers with wheels. All versions are powered by a 134bhp electric motor paired to a 50kWh battery pack. There are three driving modes (Eco, Normal and Power), each progressively increasing the available power output. A range of 148 miles is claimed on the WLTP cycle, with a charge from 0-80% taking 30-minutes using a 100kW fast charger. An 11kW wallbox will do the job in 5 hours. If you’re in a tight spot and need to charge from a domestic wall socket, it will take 31 hours to get from 0-100%. It's the same as the Citroen e-SpaceTourer and Vauxhall Vivaro Life Electric, which are almost identical bar the front-end styling. The two trims on offer are called Business and Business VIP, a subtle hint at what Peugeot expects most e-Travellers will be used for. That doesn’t preclude it from being a rather practical family vehicle though, especially since you can seat between four to nine occupants based on the seat layout. Both trims can be had in standard and long wheelbase versions. The two trims on offer are called Business and Business VIP, a subtle hint at what Peugeot expects most e-Travellers will be used for, but it's still a practical family vehicle Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The base trim comes with manual air conditioning, rear parking sensors, cloth seats and 17-inch black steel wheels. Business VIP adds several useful extras like keyless entry, hands free electric sliding rear doors and sat nav. An optional safety pack adds driver aids like adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning and automatic emergency braking. Interior space is cavernous, with up to 1,162 litres of boot space available on long wheelbase models even with nine seats in place. With five seats in place, you can pack in 3,000-litres of cargo (4,900-litres with both rear rows removed). The huge rear tailgate and low load lip make it easier to load bulky and heavy items.

peugeot,508,"Is the Peugeot 508 a good car? If you need a large family car, but don’t want to be go for the boring side of sensible just yet, the Peugeot 508 could be the model for you. If a Volkswagen Passat is a smart shirt-and-chinos combo, the 508 is more of a sharp Givenchy suit, probably worn by a model smoking Gauloise outside a Left Bank cafe. It’s tres cool. And an update in 2023 means it's even better looking than before. The ultra-slim headlights blend into daytime running lights that look like they've been etched by a claw strike from a big lion. The grille blends into the bodywork, which is a unique look, while the rear LED lights have a new design with three angled lines. But while its stylish five-door hatchback/saloon/coupe body looks great – and there's a more practical yet still very fancy-looking 508 SW estate version, too – the back seats are noticeably more cramped than in alternatives such as the Skoda Superb or Volkswagen Passat. It's an appealing option in a dwindling selection of saloon-style models, though; former options such as the Ford Mondeo and Vauxhall Insignia have been dropped due to falling sales. Okay, so you might have to put up with a few complaints from tall passengers in the back, but you certainly can’t accuse the Peugeot 508’s interior of being boring. Its dashboard design is far more interesting than most alternatives and all models come with two large infotainment screens that make the cabin look bang-up-to-date. If you’re more interested in old-fashioned, solid build quality, however, the Peugeot 508 might not be the car for you. It’s certainly not terrible, but the Peugeot’s materials don’t feel as consistently brilliant as those in a Skoda Superb. But driving the Peugeot 508 feels much sportier than pottering about in the Skoda thanks to the 508’s low-set driving position. Not everyone will be a fan of its small steering wheel, though. If you can see past the fact it's a bit cramped inside, the Peugeot 508 is a comfortable family car that really stands out from the crowd Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The boot isn’t the biggest – look to a Superb if that is what matters most to you – but the 508’s large hatchback door makes loading bulky items relatively easy, even if you do have to lift them over a slight boot lip. So, the Peugeot 508’s practicality might not be particularly impressive, but if you’re considering a sporty-looking saloon car, you’ll likely have more than a passing interest in how it drives – and you won’t be too disappointed. The Peugeot 508 is fun to drive down a twisty road, but also manages to smooth out bumps quite effectively too. There's also a sporty Peugeot Sport Engineered (PSE) version if you want more ability in the bends. The 508 isn’t quite so clever when it comes to autonomous driving tech, however. It’s available with active cruise control and lane assist, but these systems aren’t as sophisticated as those you’ll find in a Volvo V60. The engine lineup is limited now to one petrol and one hybrid, plus a more powerful hybrid system in the sporty PSE. The entry-level engine is a 1.2-litre petrol with 131hp that gets up to 50mpg in official tests. However, for ultimate fuel economy, you can drive around 40 miles on electricity alone with the 225hp plug-in hybrid engine. You'll have to keep the batteries topped up and drive like a saint to achieve its official 274mpg economy figure, though. There will be no saintly driving in the other plug-in version, the 360hp 508 PSE. Think of it as the 508’s answer to the BMW M340i in that it's sportier than the regular model, but it's not supposed to be a hardcore performance car. Other family cars are better built and more spacious, but if that all sounds a bit too ‘pipe and slippers’ for you, then the 508’s stylish design and fun drive make it worthy of a place on your shortlist.

fiat,500,"Is the Fiat 500 a good car? The Fiat 500 is perfectly suited to short urban commutes or popping into town. In the same way you wouldn’t wear a miniskirt and heels for climbing Mount Snowdon, and you wouldn’t wear tweeds and brogues to the beach, you wouldn’t buy a 500 for long cross-country schleps. The compact city car is something of a dying breed, but if you’re shopping for a Fiat 500 then you could also consider the Toyota Aygo X, Kia Picanto or the Renault Clio. The little Fiat has all these cars beaten on the style front though, offering a unique splash of retro chic. Things get even funkier inside, where the body-coloured dashboard and optional white steering wheel help lift the ambience nicely. The seats themselves aren’t the comfiest, but there’s plenty of adjustment to help you get a good view out and all the controls are grouped sensibly together so they’re a doddle to use. That said, the Fiat 500’s 7.0-inch touchscreen infotainment system takes a bit of getting used to thanks to the fiddly menus, but you can always use the standard-fit Apple CarPlay or Android Auto instead. Sadly, there isn’t much you can do about the Fiat 500’s cramped seats. Two adults in the front will be fine, but anyone close to six-feet tall will struggle for knee- and headroom in the back, and there isn’t a great deal of space in the Fiat 500’s boot for everyone’s luggage. The Fiat 500 is one of the most fun small cars around – not just for how it looks but also for the sheer number of characterful options you can choose from to make it your own Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer You probably won’t be packing the Fiat 500 with loads of bulky baggage though, will you? More likely you’ll be doing the school run, heading to work or popping to the shops. In these respects, it does a great job. Kids will have no trouble jumping into the back and the Fiat 500’s small size makes it just the thing for nipping through traffic and squeezing into tight parking spaces. Its 1.0-litre mild hybrid petrol engine is best suited to town driving as well, and it’s pretty economical. The great all-round visibility and light steering also help to make light work of tight car parks. Sure, it isn’t the most comfortable small car out there and it’s a bit noisy at speed, but it’ll tackle a twisty country road without much body lean and all models come with cruise control to help make the occasional motorway journey a bit more bearable. It’s just a shame that you can’t get the Fiat 500 with automatic emergency braking. However, you shouldn’t let this put you off if you’re looking for a seriously stylish city car that’s cheap to run, easy to drive and comes with plenty of personalisation options.

fiat,500-electric,"Is the Fiat 500e a good car? This is the Fiat 500e, a city car with lovable retro-chic looks and an all-electric motor and battery – it's a bit like Greta Thunberg, because it's small and eco friendly. The 500e is a bit bigger and heavier than the petrol 500 that's also still on sale, but it still has diddy dimensions. If you're looking for a small EV there aren't many to choose from – but the Vauxhall Corsa Electric, BYD Dolphin and Peugeot e-208 are all great choices. Rather than add a bunch of fiddly details to the outside, Fiat’s gone back to basics and made the 500 look smoother, more rounded and even more minimalist than before. It’s like your grandad suddenly ditching the dyed comb-over and shaving his head instead. Smoother, simpler, cooler. For starters, the old car’s headlights have been ditched in favour of two semi-circular lamps with curved daytime-running lights that shine out through the bonnet. The flush door handles and hidden indicators are pretty much the only difference you’ll spot from the side, and the lack of an exhaust pipe is a dead giveaway that you’re looking at the new car from behind. OK, so the new Fiat 500e looks pretty similar to the old car on the outside, but it’s a totally different story inside. There’s a brand-new 7.0-inch digital dial display instead of traditional dials, and you get a big 10.25-inch touchscreen on the dashboard with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone mirroring. The physical controls for the heating and air conditioning are grouped together under the central touchscreen and there’s a storage tray where you’d find a gear lever in a petrol- or diesel-powered car. Space in the front is good for two adults and there are decent storage options, but the back seats cater for two only, and they’ll have to be quite small people at that. Fitting a child seat is pretty much impossible, too, while the 500’s boot is good for the weekly shop, but not much else. It is a city car, after all. With compact dimensions and an all-electric powertrain, the Fiat 500e is a superb city car option, even if the range won't take you too far out of it Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The Fiat 500e comes with two battery options – one that offers a 115-mile range and another with a 199-mile range, which isn't great when each of the other alternatives can go comfortably more than 200 miles in official tests. You can recharge your 500 using a three-pin socket, but that’ll take all night – literally. You’ll be better off getting a wallbox to take advantage of AC charging up to 11kW (or 7.4kW if that's the maximum you can get at your house), which will charge the battery in under three hours. The quickest way to charge is using a public fast charger, with the Fiat 500 capable of taking up to 85kW. At these speeds it can go from empty to 80% charged in 35 minutes, and add a useful 30 miles of charge in just five minutes. The Fiat 500 comes with either a 95hp motor that can hustle it from 0-62mph in 9.5 seconds, or a 118hp electric motor with enough poke to accelerate it from 0-62mph in nine seconds. That doesn’t sound particularly fast but the new 500 will do 0-30mph in three seconds, which is nippy in town and faster than most small city cars. Also handy in town is the new 500’s automatic emergency braking that’ll spot pedestrians and cyclists in your path and automatically apply the brakes if it thinks you’re about to hit them. That’s in addition to adaptive cruise control that’ll accelerate and brake for you on motorways to keep you a safe distance from the car ahead. There are three driving modes, Normal, Range and Sherpa. Range mode uses the motor to recharge the batteries when you brake to help boost the Fiat 500’s range, while Normal model tones down this ‘regenerative braking’ effect. The Sherpa function limits the 500’s top speed to 50mph (down from 93mph) and turns off the air conditioning. These extreme measures will be useful in an emergency when you really need to eke out every last mile to reach a charging point. So, the Fiat 500 is now an electric city car, but we think you’ll agree it’s a good one, provided you don’t need lots of space or expect the last word in interior quality. If you just love the looks, head to our Fiat 500e deals page. If you'd like a used Fiat 500 then head over to our used 500e deals.

fiat,500x,"Is the Fiat 500X a good car? The Fiat 500X isn’t a bad choice if you’re looking for a small, stylish SUV and find yourself put off by the bland looks of the SEAT Arona or the stodgy drive offered by the Citroen C3 Aircross. The 500X was launched in 2014 and – to help it keep pace with the SEAT and Citroen – got a facelift in 2018. Changes included an updated interior, a new infotainment system, extra safety kit and a couple of new petrol engines. The diesels from the old model have been dropped. In terms of exterior styling, only the lights have changed – you now get new daytime running lights and rear LEDs – so you’ll struggle to tell the difference between the old car and this 2018 model. You can also choose from two exterior (rather optimistically coined) ‘body styles’ – Urban Look, which has conventional body coloured bumpers or Cross Look which has chunkier bumpers with mock skid plates. The interior gets the same retro look as the outside, the large swathe of body-coloured plastic that runs across the dashboard gives the 500X a playful feel that’s missing from the dingy SEAT Arona. But, while the 2018 500X gets a new instrument binnacle and a new steering wheel, its interior plastics look cheap in places, particularly in the back, and its switches and buttons are a little flimsy. The 500X looks like a cutesy Fiat 500 that's been blown up like a balloon and given a pair of extra doors Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The infotainment system has also been updated but doesn’t have the clear graphics or ease of use you get in the SEAT’s system. You do, however, get Apple CarPlay and Android Auto as standard in the Fiat, so it is easy to use your smartphone’s apps on the car’s 7.0-inch screen. Up front, there’s plenty of space to get comfy even if you’re tall and someone of a similar size should be able to squeeze behind you, too. The Fiat has a slightly smaller boot than its aforementioned alternatives, but it is easy to load and has space for a couple of large suitcases. Filled to the brim with people and stuff, the 500X’s otherwise nippy 120hp petrol engine isn’t going to feel quick, but it’s still the engine to go for because the quicker 150hp 1.3-litre model’s standard automatic gearbox is frustratingly slow to change which blunts acceleration. It’s a shame the more powerful engine is spoiled because there’s not much wrong with the way the 500X drives. In town, you can zip in and out of gaps in traffic, while at faster speeds there’s not too much body lean to worry about and the Fiat’s weighty steering makes it easy to place in bends. On the motorway, the suspension smooths out bumps better than it does at slower speeds, although the cabin does suffer from a fair amount of wind noise.

fiat,600,"Is the Fiat 600 a good car? The Fiat 600 is a bit like a designer handbag you buy because of its stylish looks, but when you get it home you find you can barely fit anything inside. That’s because while the 600’s retro-inspired looks will certainly turn heads, alternatives are much more spacious. And there are alternatives aplenty, from the chic Renault Captur to the rugged Dacia Duster, smart Volkswagen T-Cross and ultra-efficient Toyota Yaris Cross. You could even consider the bigger, plug-in hybrid MG HS, which isn’t a great leap in price. Yet while most of those cars look good in their own way, none is quite as funky as the 600. Sure, it’s not as effortlessly cool as the smaller Fiat 500, but it’s not a bad effort and wears its curves well. That curvy theme continues inside, with a large oval dashboard that, on the base trim, is painted the same shade as the exterior, which works particularly well if you opt for one of the brighter colours. However, there are cheap materials aplenty, and the floppy cover for the central storage bin is just… odd. Space is pretty good for those in the front though, with plenty of places to store bits and bobs, but that’s where the practicality ends. The rear seats are tight and the boot, at 385 litres is smaller than most alternatives offer. The Captur offers up to a massive 616 litres if you slide the rear seats forward. Alternatives offer more space, but if you’re looking for a slightly roomier upgrade from the 500 then the 600 is an intriguing option Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The infotainment system has sharp enough graphics, but navigating its menus and finding various settings is unintuitive. You can at least bypass most of this with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, which come as standard – and you’ll need to in the base model, because there’s no built-in navigation. Although Fiat markets the 600 engine as a ‘hybrid’, neither of the two engine choices are a proper self-charging or plug-in unit, so you won’t be cruising around town on electric power watching your MPGs skyrocket. However, it’s very effective at engaging electricity at lower speeds or when decelerating, so it’s relatively efficient – 50mpg is achievable – and smooth to drive around town. If all-electric motoring appeals you might consider the Fiat 600e instead. The diminutive footprint might not be great for space but it does mean the 600 is a doddle to drive in the city, particularly if you’re stepping up from the smaller 500. The suspension handles bumps well even at higher speeds, meaning motorway trips are nothing to fear. It’s anything but exciting to drive, though.

fiat,500l,"Is the Fiat 500L a good car? The 500L is Fiat’s attempt at injecting a little style and character into the small multi-purpose vehicle (MPV) market, and it would certainly stand out parked between the equivalent Ford or Vauxhall. The 500L itself is actually based on the Fiat Punto, and is aimed at customers who find the idea of a 500 appealing, but need more space.

fiat,panda,"Is the Fiat Panda a good car? It might not have the retro looks of the Fiat 500, but the Panda is stylish. Its upright body means there’s plenty of room inside and all models come with five doors for great access. Interior quality might not be up to the standards of a Volkswagen Up, but it’s fair to say that Fiat has harnessed a decent amount of charm. The Panda feels at its best in the city, where its small dimensions make it perfect for weaving through congested streets and squeezing into tight parking spaces. Small engines mean the Panda is also cheap to run, but not best-suited to fast-moving motorway traffic, where it can feel a little out of breath. There are two body styles available. The first is the regular Panda, which is available on the base trim and looks like a typical city car. You also have the Cross, which can be found on the three other trims, called Red, Garmin and Top. This has some extra body cladding and other rugged-looking features that give it some baby off-roader style. The Fiat Panda is a quirky small car that's affordable but above all else fun Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Pandas are cheap cars, which means standard equipment is pretty basic and includes items such as central locking, six airbags, a CD player and power steering that can be lightened at the touch of a button. Overall, the Fiat Panda is a charming and well-sorted small car that has plenty of appealing traits. The space on offer is quite impressive for such tiny dimensions, it’s cheap to buy and run and is abundant in style and character. There are a few rough edges here and there, and rivals such as the Kia Picanto and Volkswagen Up are very tempting alternatives to the funky Fiat. However, the Panda has a lot going for it, and is a much more capable all-rounder than the alternatives.

fiat,panda-cross,"Is the Fiat Panda Cross a good car? The Fiat Panda Cross is a chunky little hatchback that could be your ideal compact off-roader if you fancy something small and easy to drive but live somewhere prone to bouts of harsh winter weather. Unlike the Suzuki Jimny, the Fiat Panda Cross isn’t a thoroughbred 4×4 – as its name suggests, it’s based on the humble Panda hatchback. Peel away the Cross’ angrier bodywork, however, and you’ll find a neat four-wheel-drive system that means it’ll keep up with the Suzuki long after many more expensive SUVs have got themselves well and truly stuck. Its huge plastic bumpers and silver door protectors aren’t just for show, either – they’ll help make sure the Fiat Panda Cross’ bodywork springs back into shape should you have an altercation with a particularly solid piece of the countryside. It even comes with two tow hooks front and back so you can use the Panda’s off-road prowess to rescue other motorists caught in a sudden snowstorm – if you feel like it, that is. This rugged utilitarian theme continues in the Fiat Panda Cross’ cabin – only here it’s less appealing. Sure, the square instruments look pretty funky and the contrasting silver slab and copper-effect dashboard add a splash of colour, but the plastics all feel hard and scratchy and you don’t get a great deal of equipment as standard. The Fiat Panda Cross is fun little 4x4 that’ll plug its way through terrain that’d see many bigger SUVs stranded but, if you’ll just use it to potter around town, get a standard Panda Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer So, it might not feel all that plush inside, but at least the Fiat Panda Cross’ cabin is pretty roomy. There’s loads of headroom in the front (although a height-adjustable driver’s seat doesn’t come as standard on entry-level cars) and three kids will have plenty of space to stretch out in the back. A Dacia Duster as more space for tall adults, though, as well as a more practical boot than the diminutive Fiat Panda Cross. The Dacia’s engines aren’t quite as economical as the Fiat’s, though. You can get the Panda Cross with either a city-friendly 0.9-litre two-cylinder petrol or a more powerful 1.2-litre four-cylinder that’ll be better if you plan on doing long motorway journeys or any kind of serious off-roading. If you plan to stick to the asphalt, though, you’ll find the Fiat Panda Cross feels very similar to the standard Panda – that’s to say it’s a doddle to manoeuvre in town, easy to park and even reasonably comfortable. It’s not particularly spritely – whichever engine you pick – and it leans a fair amount in tight corners, though not enough to make passengers feel ill. What it lacks, though, is any kind of advanced safety kit, such as the automatic emergency braking feature you get in a Suzuki Jimny. That being said, the more affordable Fiat is still a charming compact off-roader that’s well worth a second look.

fiat,panda-4x4,"Is the Fiat Panda 4x4 a good car? The Fiat Panda 4×4 is a compact city car that’ll take the odd off-road excursion in its stride. It’s just as easy to live with as the standard Panda but comes with a grippy four-wheel-drive system that makes it a worthy alternative to the likes of the Suzuki Jimny and Dacia Duster 4×4. Inside, however, the Fiat Panda 4×4 comes with a much more stylish cabin than the unapologetically basic Suzuki. The dials, heating controls and even the centre of the steering wheel come with a squared-off circular design (should that be squircular?) and you can choose from a selection of camouflage olive, beige and brown trims for the dashboard. Less worthy of praise, however, is the Fiat Panda 4×4’s infotainment system. Rather than a slick touchscreen like you get as standard in many other small SUVs (including the Suzuki Jimny) you’ll have to make do with a back-to-basics stereo and CD player with an old-fashioned orange and black display. Fiat’s UConnect app lets you use some of your smartphone’s features while you’re driving, but it’s nowhere near as intuitive as the more commonplace Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone mirroring systems you’ll find in many alternatives. So, the Fiat Panda 4×4 doesn’t have a particularly high-tech cabin, but at least it’s relatively spacious for such a small car. Its tall body means there’s enough headroom in both the front and rear seats for adults to get comfy, but those in the back will be left wishing there was slightly more leg room – especially on long journeys. It’s a similar story when you take a look at the Fiat Panda 4×4’s boot. Its 225-litre capacity is big enough for a weekly shop but significantly smaller than the space you get in the likes of the less off-road focussed SEAT Arona and Renault Captur. Unlike most so-called off-roaders, the Fiat Panda 4x4 is perfectly capable of hauling you and three friends over deeply rutted fields and up snowy hills without breaking a sweat Mat Watson Carwow expert Also smaller than in many alternatives is the Fiat Panda 4×4’s diminutive 0.9-litre petrol engine. It might only have two cylinders, but it packs a fairly decent 85hp punch so it doesn’t feel too sluggish. It’ll accelerate from 0-62mph in a reasonable 12.1sec, and Fiat claims it’ll return 57.6mpg – although you’ll probably see a figure closer to 45mpg in normal driving conditions. There’s also a 1.3-litre diesel you should consider if you do lots of motorway miles. It’s not as fast as the petrol, but it uses less fuel and it’s slightly quieter when you’re cruising along. Not that the Fiat Panda 4×4 feels particularly at home whizzing along at 70mph, that is. It’s much more adept nipping through town where its small size and relatively large windows make it a doddle to manoeuvre and easier to park than the larger Dacia Duster. The Fiat Panda 4×4 is pretty comfortable to drive over poorly maintained roads, too, and it doesn’t lean a great deal in tight corners – despite its jacked-up suspension that makes it taller than the standard Panda. Head off-road, and the Fiat Panda 4×4’s special tyres and four-wheel drive mean it’ll happily traipse through mud that’d leave most two-wheel-drive SUVs well and truly stuck. It doesn’t have quite the same boulder-traversing abilities as the Suzuki Jimny, but it’ll prove more than capable of dealing with a few inches of snow or a heavily rutted field. Unfortunately, the Fiat Panda 4×4 there is a fly in the ointment The Panda Cross – with which the 4×4 shares many components – earned a mediocre three-star safety rating when it was crash-tested by Euro NCAP in 2015. If, however, you’re looking for a cheap, cheerful 4×4 that won’t cost the earth to run you should still consider the Fiat Panda 4×4 – especially if you actually plan to use it off-road.",Carwow
fiat,600e,"Is the Fiat 600e a good car? The Fiat 500e is a great city car, but what if you need a bit more space? Step forward the Fiat 600e - the Italian firm’s small, fully-electric SUV. It captures some of the charm and style that’s made the 500 so popular, but stretches it across a bigger body with much more interior room and - importantly - five doors. Think of it like the 500’s older sibling. It’s not quite as cute to look at as the baby of the family, and might not get as much attention - but it’s a lot more useful when you need a helping hand. The 600e may be bigger than the 500 but it’s still pretty small by SUV standards. Compared with alternatives such as the Peugeot e-2008, MG ZS EV or Carwow Car of the Year-winning Volvo EX30, it’s quite a bit smaller. It’s more like a jacked-up hatchback, having a similar footprint but higher roofline than cars such as the Vauxhall Corsa Electric. Those tiny dimensions mean the 600e is fantastic for driving and parking in cramped towns and cities, and if you’re upgrading from a 500 it won’t feel intimidating or too bulky. Despite this, interior space is pretty good. The front seats have loads of room, and while the back seats are a bit too cramped for adults to get very comfortable they’re plenty spacious enough for a couple of child seats. Fiat 600e: electric range, battery and charging data Range: 254 milesEfficiency: 4.7mi/kWhBattery size: 54kWhMax charge speed: 100kWCharge time AC: 7hrs 45 mins, 7kWCharge time DC: 27 mins, 20-80%, 100kWCharge port location: Rear leftPower outputs: 154hp You do pay for that with the boot space, however, which at 360 litres is larger than most electric hatchbacks but smaller than just about every other comparable electric SUV. Inside, there’s quite a lot to like. The 600e shares many of its components with its close sibling, the Jeep Avenger Electric, but adds in a dose of Italian style familiar to those who’ve sat in a 500. There’s a swooping shape to the dashboard and some shiny trim, plus a pleasing round housing over the instrument cluster. It’s quite a trim-dependent interior, though, with posh La Prima cars getting light-coloured upholstery and trim that really lifts the cabin - while the darker trim of entry-level cars looks and feels a little cheap. There’s plenty of storage space with big door bins and adjustable cupholders, but the fabric flap that covers the central storage bin is just plain annoying. The infotainment system is Fiat’s latest, and it’s based on a very wide but quite shallow display. It can be a bit awkward to use, and a little jerky to flick between menus - but the screen itself is high-res and the wireless smartphone connectivity works perfectly well, allowing you to bypass Fiat’s own system if you want to. The Fiat 600e is a characterful electric SUV that's great to drive in the city – and it's good value, too Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer There’s also a nice set of physical climate controls, which is much easier to operate on the move than having to head into a display sub-menu just to adjust the temperature. On the road, the 600e is genuinely impressive especially considering its price. It soaks up bumps as well as any of its alternatives, and can make some much more expensive cars feel positively uncomfortable in comparison. Dealing effortlessly with speed bumps and bad roads, plus super-light steering and good visibility means the Fiat 600e is a fantastic EV to drive around town. It’s comfortable on longer trips, too, though it doesn’t feel quite as stable and tied down as some alternatives and there’s a bit more noise on the motorway. The 600e is available with just one motor and battery option at the moment. It officially offers 254 miles of range from a pretty modest battery capacity, and in our tests it proved impressively efficient - resulting in a real-world range of about 200 miles. Public charging from 20-80% takes less than half an hour, which is par for the course. If you’re not ready to make the switch to electric just yet, there's also a hybrid 600. So the Fiat 600e is a decent small electric SUV overall – it’s a bit cheap inside and not hugely practical, but it’s packed full of character and is comfortable to drive around town. It’s priced temptingly, too. Interested? Check out the latest Fiat 600e deals available through Carwow.

fiat,tipo,"Is the Fiat Tipo a good car? The Fiat Tipo is available with a choice of two petrol and two diesel engines in five different power outputs. The entry-level 1.3-litre diesel model comes with a five-speed manual gearbox while larger engines benefit from a six-speed manual. A six-speed automatic gearbox is offered on 1.6-litre petrol and diesel cars and Fiat has announced a dual-clutch version will be available in the near future. Its interior is a departure from the retro-inspired Fiat 500 range and focuses instead on basic functionality and occupant comfort. The rear seats have an impressive amount of legroom and the tall rear roofline provides decent headroom. As a result, three six-foot tall passengers can sit in the back for shorter journeys. Standard equipment on entry-level cars might disappoint some customers although a seven-inch touchscreen infotainment system with Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and sat nav is available on higher-spec models. The 440-litre boot is more spacious than those in the Nissan Pulsar (350 litres) and Renault Megane (384 litres) but lags behind the Skoda Octavia's capacious 600-litre load bay. The rear seat bases can be flipped forward allowing the seat backs to be folded completely flat and the lack of discernible load lip makes loading heavy or bulky items easy, too. The Tipo is a reasonably priced car that needs more than that to be competitive in this end of the market Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The Fiat Tipo does a good job of blending cheap running costs with impressive practicality and a reasonably refined ride in a distinctive and sharply-styled package. The selection of engines on offer might be sparing, but two efficient diesels and a number of rev-happy petrols should mean there’s a Tipo to suit the needs of most potential customers.

fiat,qubo,"Is the Fiat Qubo a good car? The Fiat Qubo is a small MPV with a roomy interior and a very practical boot. If you’re searching for a bigger alternative to a small hatchback and don’t fancy an SUV, this funky-looking, boxy car could be the answer. If the Fiat Qubo will likely remind you of a small van with windows, that’ll be because it uses plenty of the same mechanical bits and bobs as the Italian firm’s smallest commercial vehicle. As a result, it doesn’t have quite the same street-cred as an equally tall and boxy SUV, but you won’t have any trouble finding it in a crowded supermarket car park. The Fiat Qubo’s interior carries on the theme set out by its boxy exterior. The dashboard is pretty plain, save for a few silver plastic panels, but at least the knobs for the heating and the buttons for the stereo are easy to reach. It doesn’t feel as plush or as solid as many similarly priced hatchbacks, however, and you can’t add any colour to the Qubo’s pretty drab interior with any posher trims or colourful inserts. Almost every surface feels hard and brittle too, but at least you get a rubber floor as standard which is a doddle to keep clean. This form-over-function approach runs right the way through the Fiat Qubo’s cabin. There are acres of headroom, the front doors open nice and wide and the back doors slide rather than swing open so it’s easy for passengers to climb in – even in tight parking spaces. If you’re looking for an unashamedly practical box on wheels, the budget-minded Fiat Qubo makes a good choice. Just don’t expect it to win any admiring glances… Mat Watson Carwow expert Once inside, they’ll find there’s loads of legroom to stretch out – even if they’re tall and sit behind a six-foot driver. The three back seats are all equally wide so you can carry three adults at once without anyone fighting over who has to sit in the middle seat. If no-one’s tagging along for the ride you can flip the back seats forward and use the Fiat Qubo to carry absolutely masses of luggage. The boot’s wide and square and comes without any kind of load lip so it’s dead easy to slide in some heavy furniture. You can even fold the front passenger seat forward to carry really long items. With the back seats in place, the Qubo can carry about the same amount as a small family hatchback such as the Skoda Fabia. Speaking of which, the Fiat Qubo feels remarkably like a conventional hatchback to drive – despite its boxy shape and tall body. Sure, you’d never call it fun, but it irons out bumps reasonably well around town and doesn’t lean excessively on twisty roads. You can get the Fiat Qubo with one petrol and one diesel engine. Neither are particularly gutsy, but the latter’s your best bet if you spend any length of time on the motorway while the petrol will suit inner-city drivers better. You can’t get the Qubo with any particularly clever safety feature like you can in most small hatchbacks or SUVs, but when it comes to outright load-carrying ability, this quirky van-based MPV offers decent value for money. Check out our Fiat Qubo deals to see how much you can save on one.",Carwow
fiat,500c,"Is the Fiat 500C a good car? Inspired by ‘La Dolce Vita’ of warm days in Tuscany or Rome, the Fiat 500C is a convertible small car that has a sliding soft-top and wonderfully retro styling. With only the Mini Convertible and Toyota Aygo X (when it's fitted with a sliding roof) the only true alternatives, the 500C is part of a rare breed – but it’s not going the way of the dodo just yet, with the 500 Electric Convertible taking up the zero-emission mantle. Its style is classic Fiat, with plenty of chrome trim around the main badge and lights matching the throwback looks. The short overhangs, which make it great in town, are matched with more chrome around the back, which has rectangular lights and shows the full extent of the sliding roof. Inside, most of the dashboard features a body-coloured panel to match the outside. That hosts the 7.0-inch touchscreen, the climate controls and a high-mounted gear lever. The steering wheel sits in front of the speedometer, which has the rev counter inside it as well as a small driver information display, which isn’t easy to navigate. Top versions get a 7.0-inch screen behind the wheel, although that isn’t the simplest to use either. You won’t find a lot of cabin space in the 500C. Yes, the driver can get comfortable fairly easily, but if you’re tall you won’t find masses of headroom available. Trying to squeeze adults into the back is very tricky, as you have to fold the front seat forward, then clamber into a space where you’ll find little room. It’s worth splashing the cash and getting the Fiat 500C Top if you want this cute and stylish supermini – even if it’s not the best to live with Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The boot isn’t particularly large either. At 185 litres, it seriously lags behind the boot in the Mini Convertible and Toyota Aygo X, while multiple other small cars top that if you’re not desperate for the sliding roof. Folding the back seats down does open more space, but the boot opening itself is too narrow to fit larger items in. You only get one engine choice with the 500C – a 70hp 1.0-litre three-cylinder petrol engine with a small generator and battery applied to help with fuel economy. That comes with a six-speed manual transmission. The sprint from 0-60mph is more of a jog, taking 13.8 seconds. In town, the keenly revving engine helps you get up to urban speeds quickly enough, while the light steering can be made even lighter by pressing a button on the centre console to make the Fiat more manoeuvrable. The 500C is comfortable enough over bumps and you get a good view around you, but the rear view can be hindered with the roof rolled down. That tiny engine does start to run out of puff when you’re on the motorway though. As it takes so long to get up to speed, you have to make the most out of every gear by revving it close to the red line. It is also quite noisy at higher speeds, with wind and road noise glaringly obvious. If you’re in an Abarth 695C – a tricked-out Fiat 500 – twisty roads are a lot of fun. Not so much in the Fiat 500C. You feel like you might topple over if you take a corner too quickly, and the steering does not give you a great sense of how much grip your front tyres have. While the Fiat 500C offers a lot for those wanting to enjoy sunnier weather when driving around town, there are sacrifices that need to be made –. it’s not that practical for its size and isn’t refined when you need to go on a longer journey, with a Mini Convertible or Toyota Aygo X being more accomplished overall.

bmw,1-series,"Is the BMW 1 Series a good car? The BMW 1 Series is a posh family hatchback with a high-quality cabin and loads of cutting-edge tech. You may also be considering the Audi A3 or Mercedes A-Class if you’re shopping for a premium hatchback, and the 1 Series was updated in 2024 with a new look and an updated cabin. The 1 Series has always been the go-to if you want a premium hatchback with a sporty edge. It’s a bit like choosing a pair of Yeezys over some Dr. Marten loafers. There are very few small cars which feel as posh inside as the BMW 1 Series, and this was only improved during the 2024 update. All the materials feel soft and yielding and everything is really solid. Quality in here is much better than it is in a Mercedes A-Class. The tech you get inside is also really impressive. All cars get a huge curved display atop the dashboard comprising a 10.7-inch touchscreen and a 10.3-inch digital driver’s display, and it’s all very responsive and easy to use. Watch: BMW M135 review As is the case in most BMWs the driving position is spot on. There’s loads of adjustment in the seats and steering wheel for all drivers big and small to get comfortable. Once you’re ready to go, there are also plenty of cubby holes for you to empty your pockets into. Moving to the rear seats, the space on offer is best described as adequate. If you’re only carrying two people back there then they’ll have enough legroom, however headroom could be a struggle for taller adults. Getting three people back there is also a tight squeeze, and a Volkswagen Golf is more adept at carrying rear passengers. Boot space is also down on some of this car's key competitors. In the basic petrol model you get significantly less space than an Audi A3 or Honda Civic have to offer, however the BMW’s load area is a nice square shape and there isn’t much of a lip to haul items over. As for engines, there are just three on offer and they’re all petrol-powered. Entry-level models get a 1.5-litre three-cylinder with 170hp, then there’s a 2.0-litre with 218hp or the range-topping M135 hot hatchback with 300hp and all-wheel drive. The 1 Series really is a good, premium-feeling small car, it’s just a little bit expensive Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Once you’ve loaded the car up and hit the road, the first thing you’ll notice is that even the entry-level petrol model has a hot hatch feel to it. The steering is responsive and it’s great fun to thread down a country road, though the performance-focused M135 isn't as exciting as the Volkswagen Golf R, even if there's no denying it's fast in a straight line. The sportiness does come at the expense of comfort though, because even the normal 1 Series is a bit firmer than an Audi A3. This is especially apparent around town, where the car jitters around over potholes and broken surfaces. Still, at least the steering is nice and light and you get decent all-round visibility. Things settle down on the motorway, where the cabin feels nice and hushed. There’s just a hint of tyre roar disturbing the peace, but the 1 Series is a relaxing car for covering long distances. So the BMW 1 Series is great to drive, packed with tech and really well-made. Some alternatives are more comfortable though, and quite a lot of features are pricey options. Check out the latest BMW 1 Series deals if you fancy this as your next car and want to save some cash, or browse offers on other BMW models.

bmw,2-series-active-tourer,"Is the BMW 2 Series Active Tourer a good car? Crossovers and SUVs dominate the family car market these days, however BMW is keen to prove that the humble MPV is still deserving of a place on the driveway with the 2 Series Active Tourer. You can think of the 2 Series Active Tourer as a more sensible alternative to cars like the Audi Q2 and Mercedes GLA, and BMW’s own X1. If those cars were a pair of trendy Nike Air Max trainers, the 2 Series Active Tourer is a sensible pair of Hush Puppies. In terms of premium people carriers, only Mercedes offers something similar, with the B-Class very much in the same mould as the Active Tourer - practical rather than fashionable for the size. It may not be as stylish as a modern SUV, but you can lift the 2 Series Active Tourer by going for the M Sport pack. This gives the car some sporty-looking bumpers, as well as 18-inch alloy wheels, making it look a bit less dowdy and a bit more aggressive. This may not hide the car’s boxy shape, but the plus side is a practical cabin. Up-front there’s plenty of headroom, as well as loads of adjustment in the seats to find your ideal driving position. You get plenty of storage, with a small cubby under the armrest as well as a big space under the centre console where you could keep a bag. The glovebox is an average size, as are the door bins. You can get a wireless charging pad in front of the cupholders, which has a helpful clip to keep your phone in place. The spacious theme continues in the rear. Headroom is still generous, and there’s plenty of knee room as well. There’s also a handy armrest with cupholders in the rear, and fitting a child seat is easy thanks to the exposed ISOFIX anchor points. As for the boot, you get 470 litres of space in the 218d models, or 415 litres in the 220i and 223i versions. Plug-in hybrid versions drop to 406 litres of cargo room thanks to a battery pack under the floor, although that’s still around the same as the 405 litres offered by the Audi Q2. The 2 Series Active Tourer may not be as stylish as an SUV, but it offers plenty of practicality and a really nice interior Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The Mercedes B-Class gets 420 litres of boot space, so slightly more than the petrol and plug-in hybrid Active Tourer, but less than you get in the 218d version. It’s worth bearing in mind however that the diesel’s additional storage space is situated under the boot floor., rather than within the main luggage area The exterior design may not be as exciting as an SUV, however the interior can easily match something like a Mercedes GLA. Everything feels really well screwed together, and the materials used are all high-quality. The overall cabin layout is very similar to the BMW X1 SUV, meaning you get the same floating armrest and wide central air vent, as well as the same 10.25-inch digital driver’s display and 10.7-inch infotainment system. Engine-wise, there are plenty to choose from. Only one of them is diesel though, the 218d with 150hp. Then there’s a couple of petrol models, the 220i and the 223i with 170hp and 218hp respectively. If you’re a company car driver, you’ll probably be looking at the tax-efficient 225e plug-in hybrid. This gets a 1.5-litre petrol engine paired with an electric motor, producing 245hp and capable of an official 56 miles on electric power alone. The plug-in hybrid makes the most sense around town, where the instant acceleration of the electric motor makes pulling out at busy junctions easy. Whichever engine you go for though, the 2 Series Active Tourer is easy to drive in the urban jungle. The BMW 2 Series Active Tourer may not be the most exciting offering in the family car segment, however if you’re looking for a well-made, premium-feeling car to haul the family around, and you’re not too bothered about looking flash while doing it, this car is certainly worth a look-in.

bmw,3-series,"Is the BMW 3 Series a good car? The BMW 3 Series is like Alan Shearer. No, it’s not from Newcastle, but like Shearer it has for generations been a reliable and impressive performer, able to out-shine European and world opposition at the highest level, and is still going strong even in its advancing years. While Audi might be re-inventing the A4 as the new A5 (rather confusingly) and Mercedes has brought out a new C-Class while BMW was just updating the 3 Series, this is still a car that looks and feels totally cutting edge, especially in how it drives. Though if you would also consider an electric car, the Tesla Model 3 feels more futuristic still. In terms of styling, the most recent round of updates for the 3 Series haven’t changed that much. There’s been some small nipping and tucking around the lights and grille, some new wheels and paint options, but the overall shape and style remains the same. That’s both good and bad — good in that, overall, the 3 Series is still a handsome thing. Bad in that it hasn’t addressed some design mis-steps, such as the way the 3 looks overly bulky around the rear wheelarches. Basic Sport models get chrome trim around the radiator grille, while M-Sport models look a little more glowering with blacked-out trim. Watch: Audi A4 v BMW 3 Series v Genesis G70 v Mercedes C-Class It’s in the cabin that you’ll find the bigger changes. BMW has binned the (rather attractive) separate digital instruments and infotainment screen in favour of the big, curved, combined screen setup taken from other models such as the 4 Series and 5 Series. This means that the 3 Series now has the latest and most up to date infotainment software — which can update itself via over-the-air links — but even though the old iDrive click-wheel has been retained, there are some fiddly bits to find your way around on the screens, and the graphics don’t look quite as nice as they used to. Space in the cabin remains unchanged, which means you get just enough for four adults to sit in reasonable comfort, but there’s not the stretch-out space you’d find elsewhere. The boot is practical, especially in the Touring estate, but remember that the plug-in hybrid 330e — a hugely popular model with business user-choosers — loses quite a lot of that space to the battery, to the point where a basic VW Golf hatchback has a bigger boot. Not that you’ll care about boot space much when you’re sitting up in the driver’s seat. The BMW 3 Series has long been considered the best of its breed to drive, and that hasn’t changed, despite the fact it’s bigger and heavier now than it has ever been. While we have to wait to see what Audi has cooked up with the new A5 saloon, the 3 Series most definitely has the beating of the otherwise-impressive Mercedes C-Class when it comes to the driving experience. This is still a car that looks and feels totally cutting edge, especially in the way it drives Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The engine range has shrunk somewhat in the past few years — your choice at the base of the BMW 3 Series lineup is now restricted to the petrol 320i or the plug-in hybrid 330e. Bye-bye diesel 320d — we shall miss your combo of easy-going performance and exceptional economy, though there are plenty of excellent used examples to be found. In fact, there are now no diesel 3 Series models at all, something of a shock when you remember how wildly successful they have been over the years. Mind you, the 330e looks like it might be settling into the 320d’s economy shoes, not least because a big battery upgrade now means that it can do as much as 62 miles on electric power alone, if you remember to charge up the battery (which can’t, alas, be fast-charged from public DC chargers). Of course, if it’s serious performance you want — but you don’t fancy the expense and insurance cost of stepping up to a full-on M3 — there’s the brilliant M340i with its 374hp, straight-six, 3.0-litre turbo engine. Whisper it, but that’s actually a more enjoyable car to drive even than the mighty M3 itself. If you want to bag yourself a great deal, check out Carwow’s BMW 3 Series deals.

bmw,4-series,"Is the BMW 4 Series a good car? The BMW 4 Series is an upmarket coupe that seats four and is designed to be more stylish and fun to drive than the BMW 3 Series saloon on which it’s based. It’s also more fun than its main alternatives, the Audi A5 and Mercedes C-Class Coupe. The two-door 4 Series Coupe sits in a family of 4 Series models, along with the convertible and five-door Gran Coupe models, while the BMW i4 is the electric version of the regular 4 Series Coupe, with the coupe and convertible getting updates in 2024. But in terms of styling, if the German coupes were in an orchestra, the Audi and Mercedes would be tickling the triangle while the BMW tries its best on the tuba – that grille makes the most noise. Some will like it and some really won’t. Still, beyond that, the 4 Series is a good looking car. Its aggressive creases, sporty body kit and sloping roofline make it a sort of half-price BMW 8 Series. Inside, it’s not as in-your-face as a C-Class in terms of design, but it’s classier and the levels of quality are better than in both Mercedes and Audi. In Mercedes’ larger cars its infotainment system narrowly beats BMW’s for visual drama and the way it works, but in the 4 Series and C-Class (where Mercedes fits its older systems), it’s the BMW that takes the win. The BMW’s looks better, works better and comes with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Praise be. Audi’s system comes a close third on all fronts. The range-topping M440i is brilliant, but most people will love the 420i M Sport. Head to our deals page for the very best prices! Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The 4 Series has seating for four people and those in the front seats will have all the space they need. The driver gets a good amount of adjustment, but it’s disappointing that lumbar adjustment – good for staying comfortable on long drives – isn’t standard and only comes as part of a very expensive pack. Grrr. The rear seats are fine for legroom, even for adults, but they’ll struggle with head room if they are anywhere close to six foot. Getting in and out of the back is a struggle too, because there are no rear doors – but hey, it’s a coupe. Still, the 4 Series’ boot is a generous 440 litres, which is only slightly smaller than an A5’s and some way bigger than the C-Class Coupe’s. There’s lots of engine choice, and there isn’t a bad one. There are 2.0-litre and 3.0-litre petrol and diesels, ranging from 184hp to 374hp, but the majority of people will find the 184hp 420i 2.0-litre petrol a great choice. Do more motorway miles? The 190hp 420d 2.0-litre diesel will cruise more efficiently. If you want maximum punch, the M440d diesel and M440i petrol both have powerful six-cylinder engines with startling performance. Then there’s the high-performance BMW M4, which we have reviewed separately. Handily, all 4 Series models are huge fun to drive. They’re lower and stiffer than a BMW 3 Series, and turn into corners with more agility than an A5 or C-Class Coupe. The xDrive all-wheel drive system is available with the 420d and standard on the M440 models for added security in slippery conditions, plus BMW offers things like upgraded brakes, a sports differential and adaptive suspension to really spice things up. The M models get this as standard. That agility does mean the 4 Series feels harder over bumps in town, even in its most comfortable driving mode, but otherwise, its standard parking sensors and rear camera make light work of parking. On the motorway, the suspension feels less abrupt and the 4 Series cruises quietly, but like the lumbar support, BMW’s clever adaptive cruise control with lane-keep steering assist costs a fortune to add as part of a pack. More grrr. Despite these minor setbacks, we think the 4 Series is the best of its breed. See how much you could save on a new BMW 4 Series with carwow, or check out our latest used BMWs.

bmw,5-series,"Is the BMW 5 Series a good car? Think of an all-rounder, and two things are likely to spring to mind. First will be a Swiss army knife – the global icon for ‘a thing that does everything’ – and the next could well be the BMW 5 Series. Since debuting five decades ago, this posh German saloon has proven time and again that it can offer comfort, bags of practicality, the latest technology and serious performance. It’s a similar story with its two key alternatives – if you’re considering a 5 Series you should also take a look at the Mercedes E-Class and Audi A6. Or perhaps the Lexus ES if you want a left-field option. The latest 5 Series clearly takes hints from BMW’s recent bold design direction as seen on the likes of the 2 Series Coupe and XM, albeit a little more subdued. That said, its styling is rather challenging, lacking the elegance of its predecessors. There are odd, incohesive lines around the headlights and front bumper, a front grille that seemingly mimics beaver teeth and the rear end looks like the designers couldn’t agree on what to do so gave up halfway through the process. Watch: All-electric BMW i5 review It’s a different story inside, with BMW’s latest infotainment system present and correct, combining a 12.3-inch digital drivers’ display with a 14.9-inch central screen. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are included as standard, and operate wirelessly. The overall design is pretty good and although some of the physical buttons have disappeared, forcing you to use the touchscreen more, there are high quality materials and solid build quality to make up for it. Artificial leather upholstery comes as standard, though you can opt for the real stuff, as well as a part-Alcantara choice if you’d prefer. So you get all the good tech, but if practicality is key, you might be a touch disappointed. Petrol-powered versions of the new 5 Series promise 520 litres of boot capacity, which is less than the Mercedes E-Class and Audi A6, though not by much. On the plus side, unlike those two cars the BMW’s boot doesn’t lose capacity in the plug-in hybrid version. A Touring estate version will arrive later if you need the extra room. The BMW 5 Series is available with one petrol engine, offering 208hp, and a pair of plug-in hybrid versions with up to 489hp. Notably, there’s no diesel version, which is a sign of the times given that this model is typically popular with those who rack up serious motorway mileage. The BMW 5 Series is comfortable to drive and has a lovely interior – shame the outside just looks so… bleugh Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer It’s goodbye to diesel, but hello to electric for the first time in a 5 Series. The i5 – reviewed separately here – will do up to 361 miles on a charge, but is quite a bit more expensive than the petrol-powered model. As you might expect, the BMW 5 Series is a comfortable and refined motorway cruiser. There’s a little bit of wind and road noise but overall it’s a relaxing way to rack up miles. However, BMWs usually excel at also being great fun on a twisty road, but the latest 5 Series is a bit disappointing in this regard. The steering is numb and doesn’t give much feedback about how much grip the tyres have, while the car just generally lacks the eagerness to turn into a corner that made old versions so much fun to drive. An Audi A6 is, surprisingly, more fun here… Regardless, this is a great all-rounder and just a fraction better overall than the Mercedes E-Class and Audi A6. Want one?

bmw,5-series-touring,"Is the BMW 5 Series Touring a good car? The BMW 5 Series Touring is a posh estate car with a plug-in hybrid engine that makes it ideal as a practical family car, or for company car drivers looking for something comfortable to rack up miles in. It’s a bit like a Burberry backpack, because it’s posh and practical in equal measure. SUVs might be the on-trend choice, but there are plenty of estate alternatives to consider if you prefer to sit lower in the car. Other posh estates include the Audi A6 Avant and Mercedes E-Class Estate, or you could opt for a well-specced Volkswagen Passat. The 5 Series Touring isn’t the best-looking car, with odd angular lines in the bodywork that never feel quite as cohesive as more elegantly styled generations of old. Things get better inside, though, with a clean design for the most part. You get a smart piece of trim splitting the dashboard widthways and a pair of screens above this. BMW’s infotainment tech is some of the best in the business, with crisp displays and intuitive menu navigation. Aesthetically challenged on the outside, but the BMW 5 Series Touring should be a comfortable, practical estate car Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Boot space is up on the BMW 5 Series Saloon, increasing from that car’s 520 litres to 570 litres. Not a huge leap, but the more boxy shape should make it easier to load large items. It’s worth noting the Mercedes E-Class Estate has a roomier boot than this and the Audi A6 Avant, with the BMW’s boot the smallest of the trio. At launch, there’s just the one plug-in hybrid engine option. Called 530e, it combines a 2.0-litre petrol engine with an electric motor to make 184hp, while the battery provides a range of nearly 60 miles. This will be particularly appealing to company car drivers because of the favourable Benefit-in-Kind rate, though for the same reason the all-electric i5 Touring is also worth a look. Another plug-in hybrid, as well as a regular petrol engine, will join the line-up later. Although we’ve not been behind the wheel of this new model just yet, it’s likely to drive very much like the 5 Series Saloon. As such, you can expect a refined and comfortable car that’s at its best at motorway speeds, though perhaps not as much fun on a twisty road as its predecessors.

bmw,x1,"Is the BMW X1 a good car? The BMW X1 is the baby of the Bavarian brand’s SUV range, headed by the enormous X7 seven-seater. It may still be the entry level SUV model, but the current model is far removed from the awkward-looking compact SUV-inspired hatchback the X1 once was. Think of it as the youngest sibling in a large family. It’ll always be seen as the little one, but now it’s grown out of puberty, graduated university and it should be taken seriously. And the X1 really has grown, not just in character but in size being larger in every direction than the model that came before it. It’s a much better looking car now, with a bluff front end sporting a pair of squared-off grilles and aggressive headlights. It’s a boxy car all round, looking even larger than it is with sharp angles and crisp lines all over - especially in M Sport trim, whereas xLine cars ditch the aggressive body kit in favour of tough looking black cladding. The interior of the X1 is sleeker than the exterior, with a pared-down dashboard featuring a prominent pair of screens in a single wide display. They’re crisp and easy to read, but the infotainment menus can be a little overwhelming to use. BMW has opted to get rid of physical climate control buttons and use touch controls on the 10.7-inch screen instead, but it’s rather fiddly to use on the move. Otherwise the cabin layout is easy to navigate and pleasant on the eye, with minimalistic shapes and contrasting trims across the width of the dashboard to break up the design. Gone is the traditional gear level, with a tiny gear selector switch in its place instead. Space is good in both the front and back of the X1, especially with the sliding reach bench set all the way back. Tall adults won’t struggle for headroom and legroom at any position, though boot space is maximised with the bench all the way forwards. The X1 beats its German alternatives for boot space, at 540 litres versus the Audi Q3’s 530 litres and the Mercedes GLA’s 495 litres - though the Volvo XC40 has the X1 licked with its 578-litre boot. The BMW X1 is a great looking car in every trim level, and it's practical too. You get a range of engines to choose from, but it’s an expensive choice of small SUV - especially in M35i spec Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer BMW has given its small SUV a wide range of engine options, with the cheapest being the entry-level petrol model. There are fuel efficient plug-in hybrid options and a range-topping M35i high-performance model. All X1 models are good fun on a twisty road, but being a BMW it’s hardly a surprise. There’s little in the way of body lean when attacking corners and the steering isn’t too light for decent grip feel. It’s definitely sportier than alternatives such as the VW T-Roc and Skoda Kamiq. The M35i model is a cut above, but that’s to be expected with its BMW M135i roots. Motorways are a little noisier than you might expect from a posh SUV with some noticeable wind and road noise - especially on the larger optional wheels. In town the X1 can get shaken up over broken roads, but good all-round visibility, automatic gearboxes and a small turning circle make city driving a breeze. The X1 should be at the top of your list for a premium small family SUV, and you can check out Carwow’s BMW X1 deals here.

bmw,ix1,"Is the BMW iX1 a good car? The BMW iX1 is the German brand’s all-electric version of the ever-popular X1 SUV. The iX1 takes inspiration from the bulkier BMW iX flagship, while being the most compact family option of BMW's electric SUVs. It’s like getting the latest phone that’s one step down from the most advanced version but still on trend. Coming with the same exterior design as the latest X1, there are some blue tweaks alongside the kidney grille and angular headlights to mark out the electric version, but it's all very subtle. Sportier models also come with a more aggressive design. You get angular rear lights too with a 3D effect, plus a large rear window and sporty elements, such as the roof spoiler and low-end diffuser. Inside, there are few buttons cluttering the cabin – although that does mean you get fiddly infotainment and climate controls thanks to too many switches being removed. There’s also no iDrive control dial, which means you have to do all major functions through the touchscreen. The design is pleasing on the whole though, with soft materials used up high and on all the main touch points. In the back there’s a decent amount of space, with good head and knee room. Although quality on the whole is fine, it takes a step down from the front part of the cabin. That being said, it still feels like a top product. BMW iX1: Electric range, battery and charging data Range: 267-322 milesEfficiency: 3.5-4.0 miles per kWhBattery size: 67kWhMax charge speed: 130kWCharge time AC: 10hrs, 0-100% at 7kWCharge time DC: 29 mins, 10-80% at 130kWCharge port location: Right rearPower outputs: 201hp / 308hp Practicality-wise, the iX1 also holds its own, with an impressive 490-litre boot – only 10 litres less than the flagship iX. That being said, the boot is marginally smaller than that of the Audi Q4 e-tron, though larger than that of the Volvo XC40 Recharge. The iX1 comes with a pair of model options, both powered by the same 65kWh motor. The more powerful is the 313hp all-wheel drive xDrive30 complete with two electric motors, with one mounted on each axle for all-wheel drive. You get an official range of up to 270 miles, with the top M Sport having a slightly reduced max range of 267 miles. Then there's the front-wheel drive 204hp eDrive20 with a range of up to 294 miles. When you’re driving, it’s odd how much the iX1 feels like driving the much larger iX. The overall experience is refined and quiet, with little disruption from the outside world in terms of noise. It’s comfortable while cruising, but weighing over two tonnes contributes to the fact that you will feel some bumps through the cabin. With iX-style driving dynamics, the iX1 is well-balanced and has a premium feel. xLine has more than enough equipment for everything you need Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Around town is where the iX1 impresses most, as it is super quiet and with great visibility all round, you shouldn’t get caught out. The steering is light for easy manoeuvring, while it also doesn’t feel too big. The 'B' drive mode increases brake regen but doesn’t provide full one-pedal drive. Twistier roads do show up the weight again, as there's some lean through the bends if you’re going at higher speeds. But the steering, although lacking feel, is direct and you have plenty of grip. The iX1 feels remarkably composed and capable, and should be the benchmark if you’re in the market for an electric family SUV. It’s a shame that it’s rather expensive though. You'll want to check out the latest BMW iX1 deals on Carwow, then, to see how much you could save. There are also great deals on used iX1s, as well as other used BMWs.

bmw,x2,"Is the BMW X2 a good car? The BMW X2 marks a dramatic departure from the previous model. The old X2 looks relatively plain and almost hatchback-like, but this new X2 gets sharper styling with a fastback rear and chunky sides, plus a big grille which optionally lights up at night. It won’t be to everyone’s taste, but it’s certainly more striking. Underneath, it’s using the same mechanical bits and pieces as the taller, more practical X1, so swapping to an X2 is a bit like kicking off your wedges and strapping on some stilettos — you can walk in both, but one is much more stylish than the other. There are several other sharply-styled SUVs you could consider, too. There’s the Audi Q3 Sportback, the Volvo EC40, the Lexus LBX, and the incoming Renault Rafale. The X2’s cabin is, of course, largely shared with the X1 and that means you get the impressive-looking curved screens atop the dashboard, which includes a big central infotainment screen and a digital instrument panel. A head-up display is also optional. For the most part, the cabin looks and feels quality, but there are some unpleasantly cheaper materials if you go looking. You do have to get used to operating almost everything through the touchscreen - including the climate controls and even some of the headlight controls, which is really annoying. But that’s a criticism that can be laid at the door of many of the X2’s alternatives. The X2 isn’t a case of style over substance - it’s good to drive and high-quality inside, but the starting price makes alternatives look cheap Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Surprisingly, the X2 doesn’t compromise its practicality too much compared to the X1. Yes, the sloping roof does mean that you can’t pack in big boxes like you can in the X1, but the actual boot volume below the luggage cover is slightly better. Space in the back seats is also fine, although you will notice that there’s less headroom and less light coming in than in the X1. You can choose from two petrol-engined options for the X2. There’s an entry level X2 20i, which uses a 2.0-litre turbo four-cylinder engine driving the front wheels through a seven-speed automatic gearbox. There’s also the X2 M35i, which also gets a four-cylinder turbo 2.0-litre engine, but which is amped-up to 300hp and has four-wheel drive and lower, firmer suspension. There’s also the all-electric BMW iX2, with a choice of two power outputs - we’ve reviewed this separately here.

bmw,ix2,"Is the BMW iX2 a good car? BMW has really made a mark in the electric car market, and the iX2 is the latest addition to its EV stable. As with the petrol-powered X2, it’s based on the same mechanical package as the iX1 electric SUV, but gets sharper exterior styling that comes a little at the expense of practicality. It’s a bit like sports fleece jackets — the iX1 is a roomy and comfy fleece, designed for practicality, while the iX2 is more sporty and form-fitting, with a tailored look to it. The iX2 is entering a pretty crowded marketplace when it comes to stylish electric SUVs and crossovers — there’s already the choice of the Audi Q4 e-tron Sportback, the Volvo EC40, and of course the big-selling Tesla Model Y. On the outside, the iX2 looks very much the same as the petrol X2 — if you’re trying to tell them apart, really aside from the badges the only way to do so is to look at the grille, which is blanked-off for the iX2. If you fancy an electric car but maybe don’t fancy making too big a visual statement about it, that could be a good thing for you. BMW iX2: electric range, battery and charging data Range: 266-282 milesEfficiency: 3.6-3.8 miles per kWhBattery size: 64.8kWhMax charge speed: 130kWCharge time AC: 10hrs 0mins, 0-100%, 7kWCharge time DC: 29mins, 10-80%, 130kWCharge port location: Right rearPower outputs: 204hp / 313hp That sharply-sloping rear roofline certainly marks the iX2 out as being one of the more stylish and dramatic-looking electric SUVs you can buy — it’s definitely more interesting to look at than the slightly blobby Audi or Tesla — but it won’t be to everyone’s taste. Inside, the cabin looks and feels very modern and high-tech, but some of the materials used are too cheap when you’re shopping at the more expensive end of the iX2’s price list. The big, wide, curved-screen layout for the infotainment screen and the driver’s instruments looks great though, and it’s hugely responsive. The layout is fairly easy to find your way around, too, and the on-screen icons are large and easy to press, but there are a few too many complicated sub-menus for some functions. Practicality takes a hit compared to the iX1, as despite the boot being large on paper compared to most alternatives the sloping roof limits the size of loads that you can take. And while the rear seats are really roomy for two adults, the centre seat is almost useless - making the iX2 a four-seater except for very occasional use. With 313hp and all-wheel drive, the BMW iX2 has the performance to back up the car's sporty looks Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer BMW sells two versions of the iX2. Although they use the same size of battery, the more powerful all-wheel drive version doesn’t go as far on a charge as the less powerful two-wheel drive version, which can go 282 miles. The iX2 is as quiet and refined as you’d hope from an electric car, but while it does drive well, and can corner hard, there’s maybe not the gap between it and rivals from Volvo and Audi that there used to be. The steering is satisfying, although a little odd at times, and performance is ample. Like the iX1 it’s up there as one of the benchmarks in the sector.

bmw,x3,"Is the BMW X3 a good car? The BMW X3 is an incredibly popular family SUV - more than 3.5 million have been sold since it launched in 2003. The latest model aims to stand out with its striking exterior design, ultra-modern interior and new plug-in hybrid engine. Both upmarket and eco-conscious, then, it’s like eating at a Nobu restaurant and ordering the vegan option. It’s one of BMW’s core SUV models, being larger than the X1 but smaller than the X5 - a true family SUV, making it an alternative to cars such as the Audi Q5, Mercedes GLC, Volvo XC60 and Alfa Romeo Stelvio. At the same time, many growing families may be looking to increasingly posh offerings from less upmarket brands as a way to get more bang for their buck - think the Hyundai Santa Fe or Volkswagen Tiguan. The old X3 did look a bit like it had been designed by a committee, starting with a generic SUV shape and just pasting on BMW’s signature features such as the kidney grilles and quad headlights. The new model is much more distinctive, with a very clean look helped in no small part by ditching the black plastic cladding that used to adorn the wheel arches. There’s also an eye-catching new grille which has a mixture of diagonal and vertical lines - though racier models get a more conventional look - and which can even be illuminated by a thin LED strip around the outside. The sides are smooth, with faint sculpting giving the suggestion of a wheel arch, and recessed door handles mean there’s nothing to protrude. It’s a similar story at the rear, which has a smooth tailgate and big, angular LED taillights. Inside it’s an even bigger change. There’s a large twin-screen infotainment setup and an interesting knitted texture on the dashboard, though it’s great to see BMW’s retained some of the features we love such as the rotary controller for the infotainment system that makes it much easier to use on the move than a pure touchscreen. The new X3 looks good and drives well - shame it’s not as nice inside as its predecessor Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The most obvious feature, though, is that where BMWs of old may have used tons of chrome trim, in the new X3 it’s largely been replaced with huge hunks of translucent plastic through which sophisticated ambient lighting shines. It’s quite effective, particularly at night, but it’s definitely an acquired taste and does highlight that the interior doesn’t feel quite as luxuriously built as the old car, with some quite cheap and nasty materials around. It’s also not hugely spacious for family life. The front seats are roomy but the rears are only average, and there’s a big hump in the floor which makes the centre seat quite uncomfortable. The boot is a good size at 570 litres, marginally larger than an Audi Q5 or Alfa Romeo Stelvio, but it’s beaten easily by a Mercedes GLC or a VW Tiguan. Storage for smaller items is also a bit limited. There are four engines to choose from in the UK. There’s a 2.0-litre petrol or 2.0-litre diesel, both of which provide plenty of performance for everyday life. The most interesting is the 30e plug-in hybrid, which has up to 56 miles of all-electric range - meaning low company car tax bills and big potential fuel savings. All of these models are fairly pleasant to drive with comfortable suspension and refined engines, though they’re not quite as enjoyable as the old X3 was. At the top of the range there’s a rapid M50 model, which has a 3.0-litre six-cylinder engine and plenty of performance upgrades making it a totally different car to drive. This version of the X3 takes aim at the Audi SQ5 and Mercedes-AMG GLC 43 and does so pretty well, thanks to tidy driving dynamics and plenty of performance.

bmw,ix3,"Is the BMW iX3 a good car? The BMW iX3 is the company’s electric SUVs and an alternative to the Audi e-tron, Mercedes EQC, Ford Mustang Mach-E and Skoda Enyaq. It’s the BMW equivalent of the Monsters Inc story. Until now, the company has used scary old petrol and diesel to generate power, but now they’ve found out that laugh-a-minute electricity actually works a whole lot better for everybody, and makes you smile, too. So the iX3 is new, but just doesn’t look it. Up front, there’s the usual BMW grille, but it’s all a clever ruse because it doesn’t have to cool an engine, so it has been sealed to help reduce drag and give the car’s range a small boost. A dimpled pattern breaks up what would otherwise be a big sheet of black plastic. The 20-inch wheels are unique to the BMW iX3, too. Their heavily sculpted design helps to smooth airflow along the side of the car, improving range, although they look exceptionally vulnerable to kerbing. Assorted blue highlights to designate the electric model dotted around the iX3 – most obviously on the rear bumper where you’d normally spot some exhaust pipes – finish off the styling changes. There are also blue highlights around the ‘grille’, the badges and the sills. EV Range Test: Audi Q4 e-tron v BMW iX3 v Hyundai Ioniq 5 v Kia EV6 v Skoda Enyaq Under the skin is a solitary 286hp electric motor that also generates 400Nm of torque and drives the rear wheels. There’s an 80kWh battery pack that should give a range of up to 285 miles – that’s according to the latest official testing procedure. That’s a bit more than key alternatives such as the Audi e-tron and Mercedes-Benz EQC, but a bit less than the Jaguar I-Pace. In the real world it will be a bit below that, especially in cold, wet conditions. The iX3 should be compatible with almost every kind of charging station or power outlet, including super-fast 150kW chargers, which can give an 80% recharge in just 34 minutes. This means you can add 60-ish miles of range in about 10 minutes. There aren’t many 150kW chargers in the UK, but the network is growing. BMW iX3: electric range, battery and charging data Range: 286 - 290 milesEfficiency: 3.4-3.5 miles per kWhBattery size: 74kWhMax charge speed: 150kW / 250kWCharge time AC: 7hrs 30mins, 0-100%, 11kWCharge time DC: 34mins, 0-80%, 150kWCharge port location: Right rearPower outputs: 282hp Charging from less powerful outlets (such as a home wall-box charger or three-pin plug) will take longer – BMW reckons a full charge from empty will take around 12 hours. While electricity prices have risen lately, they’re not rising as fast as the cost of petrol or diesel, so an electric iX3 will still be much cheaper to run than a conventional X3. All electric cars feature brake regeneration – a system that uses the electric motor as an extra brake that can feed energy back to the batteries that would otherwise be lost as the car slows down. This always happens when you press the brake pedal, but the iX3 joins many of the latest electric cars by giving the system the ability to bring you to a stop when you lift off the accelerator pedal, too. It allows for one-pedal driving, which (once you’re used to it) is an extremely relaxing way of dealing with urban traffic. It’s not the fastest version of the X3, but it’s still pretty quick with a 0-60mph time of 6.8 seconds. Top speed is limited to 112mph, which helps to preserve range. It’s more than enough for UK drivers, anyway. The first thing you notice when you get out and about in your iX3 is how quiet it is. There’s no noise from the engine and transmission, so you only notice a little wind and road noise as your speed rises. A 285-mile range puts BMW right in the ballpark. It's better than a Mercedes EQC but not as good as a Jaguar I-Pace Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Adaptive suspension is fitted to the iX3 as standard, so it’s pretty comfortable, although a Mercedes EQC still trumps it for out-and-out ride quality. However, the suspension stops the iX3’s body from rolling too much during cornering. The iX3 grips strongly, too, and its handling is doubtless helped by the fact that the batteries are stored in the floor, lowering the centre of gravity. Flicking the suspension into Sport model firm things up a lot, to the extent that it makes the ride too firm, but it certainly sharpens the handling and gives the iX3 a distinctly sporty feel. All iX3s are well equipped. The entry-level M Sport comes with a 12.3-inch digital driver’s display and 12.3-inch touchscreen infotainment system, wireless phone charging, electrically adjustable leather seats, adaptive suspension (which lets you choose between soft, comfortable settings and stiffer, sportier ones) and a panoramic glass roof. The top-spec M-Sport Pro car has a Harman Kardon audio system, a head-up display and an automatic parking system.

bmw,x4,"Is the BMW X4 a good car? The BMW X4 is based on the old X3, and it’s a sleeker, sportier-looking SUV that tries to convince you that it’s a coupe. It sits between the X2 and the X6 in terms of size, and while it’s not as practical as the X3, it’s arguably the more stylish car. It’s like a chic tote bag instead of a big, roomy suitcase. Not as useful, but rather more fashionable. Inside, the X4 doesn’t have the high-tech, big-screen setup of the new X3, and nor does it have the latest tech boasted by the Mercedes GLC Coupe, but the quality levels are very high and it’s a well-designed cabin. While the X4 doesn’t get the new X3’s big, sweeping digital screen dashboard, it does stick with the old separate instrument panel and touchscreen, both 12.3 inches across. The big screen in the middle uses older iDrive software that’s still good to use, and it’s easier to control on the move than a touchscreen-only system thanks to the click-wheel controller down on the console. Up front, there’s plenty of space even if you’re tall, and the adjustable steering wheel and excellent sports seats mean that the driving position is both very good and very comfortable. In the back seats, legroom is fine but that sloping roofline means that tall rear seat passengers will find that their heads are brushing the ceiling, and it’s a bit dark and gloomy back there. The boot is actually pretty good — it holds just 45 litres less than the roomy new X3, at least when you measure up to the luggage cover — and the floor is flat, with no loading lip so it’s easy to heft heavy items up and into the boot. The rear seats fold flat, and they split 40:20:40 for maximum practicality, but you do lose a good bit of seats-down space compared to the X3 — a full 200 litres. If you’ve decided you like the looks and don’t mind the BMW X4’s reduced practicality, there’s plenty to like about the way it drives and presents itself inside Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The standard X4’s engine choice is limited to just two diesels now. If you go for a sporty M model, there’s a bit more choice, with a more powerful straight-six petrol and straight-six diesel, and even a full-on 510hp X4 M if you really want to go nuts. All models come with BMW’s xDrive four-wheel drive as standard, and all come with an eight-speed automatic gearbox. The X4 is actually quite frugal, at least in 2.0-litre xDrive20d diesel form. Thanks to that four-wheel drive system being able to disconnect the front wheels to save fuel, 49mpg is theoretically possible, with low-40s being a realistic goal. It’s still quick, hitting 62mph in 7.9 seconds, which is fine unless you truly crave the 3.8 seconds of the X4 M… For a big 4x4, the X4 is decent to drive, and keeps its composure when traversing a bumpy, twisty British B-road. The xDrive four-wheel drive sends a bit more power to the rear wheels than the fronts, allowing for a more enjoyable driving setup, but the steering isn’t as talkative as it ought to be, and so a Porsche Macan (the petrol one, not the electric one) makes a more engaging car on a challenging road. The X4 can be had with optional adaptive suspension, and this is a must. Not only does it sharpen up the handling for twisty roads, in Comfort mode it also makes the X4 noticeably more comfortable over bumps. Without the adaptive springs, it’s just not as comfy as a Mercedes GLC Coupe. The new BMW X3 is far more technologically advanced than this X4, and comes with the option of a plug-in hybrid engine, but if style is what matters, then the X4 is still worth considering.

bmw,x5,"Is the BMW X5 a good car? There aren’t many cars that can do what the BMW X5 can do: it’s like a roomy, comfortable hot hatch on stilts. It’s genuinely enjoyable to drive, much more so than alternatives such as the Audi Q7 and Mercedes GLE. If you want to get something closer, you’ll need to head to a Porsche Cayenne, but that’s a bit like a 100-metre sprinter at a marathon – it isn’t quite as comfortable or practical for families over long distances - which helped the BMW X5 to win the Adventurer's Choice category of the 2025 Carwow Car of the Year Awards. The BMW X5 has most cars very much licked on the luxury front, though. Everywhere you prod there are luxurious materials and soft-touch plastic, from the top of the dashboard to the door tops. Sure, the overall design is slightly more conservative than that of a Mercedes GLE, but for some, that’ll be a good thing, and an update in 2023 brought a much more modern design to close the gap. You get BMW's excellent twin-screen setup on the dashboard. The curved displays look suitably modern, with the one on the right displaying all the relevant driving information and the one on the left for your infotainment. It's a touchscreen and really quick to respond to your inputs, but the menus are quite complicated to find your way around. Group test: Audi Q7 v BMW X5 v Mercedes GLE v Porsche Cayenne v VW Touareg Another important factor in a large luxury SUV is space and the BMW X5 offers plenty of it. Those in the front will have no complaints and the driver gets a supportive seat with full electric adjustment and a memory function. There’s plenty of space in the back seats, as well – two tall adults will sit comfortably behind those in the front, while a third won’t be sounding off on a long journey either. That spaciousness continues to the boot, with the X5 having 650 litres, which is a good chunk less than you get in an Audi Q7 and Porsche Cayenne, though the BMW is a bit more spacious than the Mercedes GLE. There are four engines to choose from. The plug-in hybrid will be the best option for those who can charge regularly, and it also has the lowest tax rate for company car buyers. There's a sporty petrol if running costs aren't a concern, but most people will find one of the diesels offers the best all-round experience. In town, the BMW X5, despite its size, isn’t daunting to manoeuvre thanks to good visibility for the driver through its tall wide windows and standard front and rear parking sensors. In fact, BMW includes its Parking Assistant, which will steer the car into a space for you and you can add rear-wheel steering as an option for better low-speed manoeuvrability. Porsche, Land Rover, Mercedes and Audi all make very good large SUVs, but the X5 is the best all-rounder for us Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer It’s a comfortable experience, too; the X5’s optional adaptive air suspension does a good job of soaking up ruts, potholes and broken Tarmac in its most comfortable setting. That said, the M Competition’s firmer suspension (in the name of going around corners more quickly) isn’t as comfy when the going gets rough. On twisty country roads, the BMW X5 steers with precision and on its standard suspension handles well – particularly in its firmer ‘sport’ setting. The M Competition’s still-firmer suspension props the X5 up even more effectively through bends and the range-topper is more agile to drive. But, calm things down to a cruise on the motorway, and all the engines are quiet, while wind and road noise are kept to a minimum. You do hear more road noise in the M50i and M Competition with their huge alloys and super-wide tyres, though.

bmw,x6,"Is the BMW X6 a good car? The BMW X6 is a bit like Snapchat. When it first appeared, people wondered what the point was. Does anybody need a car that’s part SUV, part coupe? But like Snapchat, the X6 has defied the naysayers to prove quite popular. This large coupe-style SUV has strong engines and seating for five. It’s a sleeker version of the BMW X5 and an alternative to the similarly-styled Mercedes GLE Coupe and Porsche Cayenne Coupe. The X6 has been updated for 2024 but you still get the classic, chunky proportions that you expect from an off-roader, with a rakishly angled roof that echoes the sleek lines of a sports car. As is the trend in recent BMWs, the trademark ‘kidney’ grille is now enormous. It’s also available with illumination, to make it even more, er, eye-catching. Inside the look and feel is very BMW X5, which is a good thing. It has an interesting design but functional button layout and everything feels extremely well put together. It also means you get BMW’s latest twin-screen infotainment system, which looks amazing although some functions are harder to use than before the latest update. There are good and bad points to the X6’s space and practicality. Okay, so you’ll seat four adults just fine inside, but the X6 loses some rear headroom in the name of style compared with the X5, plus its middle seat is quite uncomfortable. The boot is smaller than an X5’s (and the Mercedes’ or Porsche’s) and a more awkward shape thanks to its sloping roofline. You’re paying a premium over the X5 for this, remember. The BMW X6 was the coupe SUV that started the discussion – you either love or hate the way it looks. This one has a light-up grille, which I’ll leave you to make your mind up on… Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer There’s a choice of petrol and diesel engines, but the highlight of the range is the performance-focused M60i. This twin-turbo V8 petrol has 530hp and a 0-62mph time of 4.3 seconds. The X6M Competition gives you more power (625hp) for a 0-62mph time of 3.9 seconds. That’s staggering pace for a car of this size and weight, but it is even more expensive to run than the M60i and requires more compromise to comfort. Even the entry-level engines are extremely strong, and given the diesel is the cheapest and most fuel-efficient of the range it makes the most sense. Whichever engine you choose, the X6 feels bulky but comfortable in town and more agile than it has any right to be on a country road given its size. On the motorway, it’s supremely comfy and quiet with the latest driver assistance tech available. The BMW X6 is a mixed bag, then. It’s superb to drive, has a lovely cabin and an eye-candy infotainment system. You’re better off just spending less money on the more practical X5, though, unless you really prefer the X6’s styling and don’t need the space. If that’s the case, you should check out the latest BMW X6 deals on Carwow to see how much money you can save. You can also browse the latest used BMW X6 stock, as well as other used BMWs. When the time comes, you can sell your current car through Carwow, too.",Carwow
bmw,x7,"Is the BMW X7 a good car? Let’s address the elephant in the room – oh, and this elephant also has a set of comedy gnashers on. Yes, the way the BMW X7 looks will not be to everybody’s taste, but if you like your large luxurious SUVs to be imposing, it doesn’t get much more so than the X7’s whopping great grille filling somebody’s rearview mirror. In fact, the BMW X7 is arguably more imposing than the upmarket SUVs it competes with, the Land Rover Discovery, Audi Q7 and Mercedes GLS. Even a full-fat Range Rover. Think of it as American sports announcer Michael Buffer at a headteacher’s conference. Watch: BMW X7 v Range Rover Inside, things are more restrained, but suitably high quality. You’ll find plenty of piano black, leather and metal surfaces, while adding a (pricey) full merino leather option brings leather lower down and a two-tone shade. Ultimately, you’ll struggle to find any scratchy plastics here and the X7 gives all its alternatives a run for their money inside. The dash is dominated by the curved twin-screen display that incorporates BMW’s latest iDrive infotainment system. It’s stunning to look at, but not quite as easy to use as the previous generation. There are a few functions that are now buried in menus rather than easily accessible with a single button press. It still has a rotary controller with menu shortcut buttons between the front seats, and you can choose to use that, the touchscreen or use voice commands. The second screen behind the steering wheel takes the place of conventional instruments. It’s clear, crisp and configurable, so you can have the information displayed that you want, including things like speed, fuel consumption, navigation info and your radio or media selection. Bluetooth, DAB radio and Apple CarPlay smartphone mirroring is all included, although not Android Auto. All-in-all, it’s better than anything from Audi or Land Rover, although the digital dash and infotainment in the Mercedes GLS is even better. The BMW X7 is a proper seven-seater as standard, which is to say, two adults will be able to sit in comfort in its rearmost seats on a long journey. A BMW X5’s optional third row is much tighter, for example. For not much extra you can swap the X7’s middle row from a three-seat bench to two more luxurious pews. If you can live with six seats rather than seven, it's worth considering Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The X7’s front two rows are even more spacious and the driver is treated to a wide range of electric seat and wheel adjustment. In fact, the middle row can be adjusted and folded electrically, while the third row folds into the boot floor electrically too. Handy buttons in the boot allow you to fold the rear two rows all at the same time for ease. Even with all seven seats up, the X7 still offers 320 litres of boot space, which is about the same as a VW Polo. Fold the rearmost seats down and that grows to a huge 750 litres – that’ll handle pretty much anything a family can throw at it. And you get a fancy split tailgate. You have a choice between one diesel and two petrol engines when buying a BMW X7. The pick of the bunch is the X7 xDrive40d diesel because, with 352hp and an official fuel economy of 32.8-36.2mpg, it has all the power you’ll need, but will keep the bills sensible. The 530hp M60i petrol is much quicker, but also much more expensive in every way, while the 381hp 40i petrol is strong and smooth, but thirstier than the diesel. The BMW X7 is vast, so driving and parking it in town can be a little daunting. Still, it comes with front and rear sensors, multiple cameras for a 3D view of the car and a system that’ll park and even reverse for you. So, no excuses then. Out of town and on meandering country roads the X7 is one of the tidiest SUVs of its type to drive despite its size, but you’ll probably be more interested in just how comfortable its air suspension is over bumps and how quiet it is at a cruise on the motorway. There’s very little wind and road noise at all, and adding BMW’s Driving Assistant Professional optional package brings a system that will accelerate, brake and keep you in your lane for an even more relaxing drive. So, make peace with its looks, don’t get carried away with BMW’s options list and the X7 is a fine luxury seven-seat SUV. Remember, though, that it’s more expensive to buy than a Discovery or Q7, and that if you don’t need seven roomy seats, BMW’s cheaper X5 makes much more sense.

bmw,ix,"Is the BMW iX a good car? This big, striking SUV is the BMW iX, the German brand’s biggest electric model and an alternative to other luxury SUVs, such as the Polestar 4 and Mercedes EQE SUV. You might also consider it as a posher alternative to the Kia EV9 if you don’t need all that space. An electric family SUV isn’t a particularly wild concept these days, but it seems no one told BMW’s designers. Like so many of the brand’s other cars, the iX has a really striking exterior design. It’s a bit like Marmite – you might love it, you might hate it, but it’s hard not to have an opinion either way. From those sharp lines and creases on its bonnet and wheelarches; to its big alloys, massive, toothy grille and squinty headlights – it’s certainly a very busy-looking design. In white in particular, you could say that it looks like someone crashed the Space Shuttle Discovery into the back of some sort of giant robotic beaver. Someone should probably tell NASA… Its dimensions are more conventional, being roughly comparable to the current X5 SUV on the outside, but with an interior that’s closer to the bigger X7 in terms of the space. And while you won’t get the option of seven seats on this new electric SUV, its cabin doesn’t skimp on any sense of luxury, tech or eco appeal. BMW iX: electric range, battery and charging data Range: 259-377 milesEfficiency: 2.8-3.1 miles per kWhBattery size: 74kWh / 108kWhMax charge speed: 250kWCharge time AC: 11hrs, 0-100%, 7kW / 16hrs 15mins, 0-100%, 7kWCharge time DC: 31mins, 10-80%, 250kW / 35 mins, 10-80%, 250kWCharge port location: Right rearPower outputs: 322hp / 516hp / 610hp That tech appeal is emphasised by a pair of huge screens that dominate the cabin. The 12.3-inch instrument panel and 14.9-inch infotainment display combine almost seamlessly to look like one big, curved display – it's an impressive sight from behind the wheel. You get a wireless charge pad, multiple USB-C ports and a range of connected services too. Build quality is top notch, and it’s very practical too with lots of space for five adults to stretch out. Boot space could be a bit more generous, though. With a 500-litre capacity, there’s less room for bags than you’ll find in the Polestar 4. You can choose from three power outputs, depending on whether you are happy with a quick car or you feel the need to warp the fabric of space and time. All three have an electric motor at each axle for all-wheel drive and a battery pack housed low down beneath the floor. The entry-level 326hp xDrive40 model has an official range of up to 264 miles, while the 523hp xDrive50 has a bigger battery that will see it travel up to 383 miles on a charge. If that’s not quick enough for you, the iX M60 has 619hp, a range of up to 349 miles, and a 0-60mph time of under four seconds. The cars have slightly different maximum charge rates (150kW for the xDrive40 and 200kW for the xDrive50 and M60), but the long and short of it is that any iX will be able to use a DC rapid charger to go from 10-80% capacity in less than 40 minutes. Plug in at home with a 7kW charger, and a full recharge will take up to 16 hours. The BMW iX is one of the best electric SUVs to drive, and has one of the coolest interiors, too Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Whichever model you go for, the BMW iX is one of the best electric SUVs to drive. It might be big, but excellent visibility makes it pretty easy to navigate tight city streets, while the air suspension on xDrive50 models smooths out bumps in the road for a comfortable drive. Out on the motorway it's lovely and quiet, making long journeys relaxing, while each of the motor options will get you up to speed quickly. And when you take the iX down a twisty road it swaps serene comfort for surprising agility. This is still a big, heavy SUV, but it's one of the more capable electric SUVs in corners. All models have all-wheel drive, which helps offer reassuring grip as you accelerate out of bends.

bmw,i4,"Is the BMW i4 a good car? The BMW i4 is like a 4 Series from a decade in the future. It shares a very similar outline, but uses all-electric power and has a slightly bolder design, as well as having a more advanced interior. It certainly won’t fade into the background, as BMW has fitted the huge kidney grille from the 4 Series Gran Coupe that the i4 is based on. In the cabin, the i4 has a plush finish to match other BMW models – it definitely feels more upmarket in here than a Tesla Model 3, and can match a Polestar 2. Entry-level models come with cloth seat trim as standard, but leather is also on offer for those wanting a high-end feel. Regardless, it’s a well-built and neatly designed cabin, but the infotainment is the star of the show and features the impressive curved display combining the 12.3-inch instrument and 14.9-inch infotainment screens in one sleek unit. Compared to the 4 Series Gran Coupe, it’s 6mm taller and sits 15mm closer to the road – but remains mostly the same. Taller passengers may struggle to fit in the rear due to the sloping roof line, but knee room is acceptable. As it’s based on a conventional fuel-powered car, there isn’t a flat floor in the footwell, so fitting three adults in will be a struggle. However, the door openings are a good size and it is more than comfortable enough. You’ll be happy to hear that it’s quite spacious in the boot, with the hatchback tailgate opening up to provide a roomy load space. The rear seats fold down to reveal a flat floor, too. The BMW i4 is the all-electric cousin of the 4 Series Gran Coupe. The M50 version is as fast as an M3 to 60mph, just not quite as fun to drive Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The i4 comes in three versions. The entry-level eDrive35 has 282hp and claims up to 299 miles of range, while the eDrive40 ups this to 366 miles courtesy of a larger battery. That version comes with a 340hp rear-mounted electric motor setup that also produces 430Nm. The top-spec i4 M50 version – which was developed by BMW's M division – is fitted with two electric motors. With one fitted on each axle, the M50 comes with four-wheel drive and has a stout 544hp and 795Nm on tap. With the same sized battery as the eDrive40, though, claimed range is reduced to up to 318 miles. Whichever i4 you want, performance isn’t an issue. Even the eDrive35 models can do the sprint to 62mph in 6.0 seconds. But if you want brutal electric acceleration, the M50 gets to 62mph in 3.9 seconds (we bettered that in our video, however). Top speed is 140mph, though, rather than the usual 155, because the range of an EV really suffers at high speed. In town, the i4 feels very comfortable over bumps and cracks in the surface thanks to air suspension at the rear, and it’s pretty nimble as well. M50 models come with adaptive suspension for further comfort, meaning that even the higher-performance model can deal nicely with poorer surfaces. As standard, the i4 features adaptive cruise control and a reversing camera – making driving on the motorway and parking much simpler respectively. Refinement is also excellent throughout the i4 line-up, with only tyre noise making an impression. If the i4 sounds like the model for you, check out our deals page to see what price you can get for this stylish electric four-door.

bmw,i5,"Is the BMW i5 a good car? The BMW i5 is a bit like an alcohol-free pilsner. You still enjoy the refreshing taste of German lager, but it’s better for you – or in this case the planet. You see, the new i5 is the all-electric version of the latest BMW 5 Series. So you can choose a traditional pilsner if you can live with an internal-combustion hangover, or pick the EV if you want to wake up feeling refreshed and virtuous in the morning. If you plan to stick with a conventionally powered BMW for a while longer, have a read of our review of the 5 Series. Here we’re focusing on the all-electric i5, and spoiler alert, it's good. The two models look broadly similar from the outside. With a smaller grille than some recent BMWs, the styling isn’t as divisive as other current Beemers. It’s a bit more understated, but it's certainly not a looker – though we have a feeling that the looks will grow on us as we become more used to the design. A slow-burner, maybe. There are two power outputs to choose from. The less powerful is the i5 eDrive40, which has one 340hp motor powering the rear wheels. Step up to the M60 for two electric motors, one for the front wheels and one for the rears. Being four-wheel drive has to be a good thing when the car has 601hp. The regular eDrive40 is quick, with a 0-62mph time of six seconds. The M60 reaches 62mph in a kidney-bruising 3.8 seconds. Both models have the same battery pack, with an 81.2 kWh usable capacity. In the less powerful, lighter model, that gives an official range of up to 357 miles, dropping to a maximum of 315 miles for the heavier range-topper. That compares with 376 miles for a Mercedes EQE 350, one of the alternatives that could be on your shortlist if you are looking for an upmarket electric saloon. Will you be able to travel that far in the real world? Well, the way you drive will make a big difference. When Mat drove the M60 in Portugal the range was closer to 200 miles, but car reviewers aren’t renowned for driving gently. Assume that’s a worst-case scenario, and the official numbers are a best case. The i5 has a lovely interior and incredible performance, it's just a shame it doesn't go a bit further on a charge Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Plenty of electric cars are fast in a straight line, but BMWs are supposed to be fun around corners as well. The i5 corners with poise, especially cars with adaptive sports suspension and active anti-roll bars. The trouble is, the i5 is heavier than the regular 5 Series saloon, weighing as much as a big 4x4. The M60 is especially heavy, which is a shame as the car doesn’t feel as light on its feet as we’d hope. Get carried away and the front tyres push wide surprisingly early. Drive more steadily and the i5 is remarkably comfortable and super-quiet, with only a murmur of wind and road noise. Inside, the cabin is a high-tech banquet for the eyes, with a huge twin-screen display and an exceptional standard of finish. Even lower down the dash and doors there’s no sign of penny-pinching. Only the brittle action of the indicator stalks feels less than premium. There’s plenty of space front and rear, too, although the big transmission tunnel that exists for the internal-combustion-engined 5 Series gets in the way if there are three passengers in the back. The car is packed with clever tech, although frustratingly perhaps the smartest technology of all isn’t available in the UK. The optional upgrade for the adaptive cruise control available in some markets will change lanes for you. All the driver needs to do is look in their mirrors to check that it’s safe, and the car’s sensors can tell that you’ve looked to the side and will swap lanes. Where legal, the driver can even take their hands off the wheel. The eye activation feature is launching initially in Germany, the USA and Canada. A UK launch date for the automated lane-changing function has not been confirmed. So, clever, quick, and very good to drive – if not quite great compared with BMW’s greatest hits of the past. Next to other electric saloons, though, the i5 is pretty much as good as it gets, and if you need a bit more practicality, a BMW i5 Touring is coming later this year.

bmw,i5-touring,"Is the BMW i5 Touring a good car? The BMW i5 Touring is an electric estate car, which means it’s a very rare thing indeed. You get the same posh interior and silent running as the i5 saloon, but with a bit more practicality. It’s like a North Face duffle bag, because it’s big, practical and has designer appeal. It's also extremely good - so good, it picked up Highly Commended in the Comfortable Cruiser category of the 2025 Carwow Car of the Year Awards. As it stands, the only other electric estates in this price range are the Volkswagen ID7 Tourer and the Audi A6 Avant e-tron, so you might also cross-shop the i5 Touring with electric SUVs such as the BMW iX, Audi Q8 e-tron and Polestar 3. BMW’s modern styling is certainly an acquired taste, but with the i5 we’re either getting used to it or the styling department is finding its groove, because it’s a much more cohesive design than other recent models such as the iX. There are plenty of sharp angles and creases in the bodywork that give it a distinctive appearance, though base models get softer styling that looks a bit plain. There can be no complaints about the interior though, because it’s a lovely place to eat up miles. The seats are soft and there are quality materials throughout, and all trim levels get the same high quality twin-screen infotainment displays. They look great with clear graphics, though the menus can be really confusing to navigate around.

Storage is good in the front and there’s loads of room in the back seats, too. The main advantage of the estate body shape is that the BMW i5 Touring has a big boot – at 570 litres it should be enough space for the vast majority of people, and more space than any of the electric SUVs mentioned above, though the VW ID7 Tourer estate has more space still if you really need it. There are two motor options to choose between, with the eDrive40 being the more affordable car to buy and to run, with a top-of-the-range M60 also available with ludicrous performance at the expense of range. As such, the eDrive40 can go up to 348 miles between charges, compared with 314 miles for the M60, which puts it behind what alternatives such as the Audi A6 Avant e-tron (437 miles) and Polestar 3 (403 miles) are capable of. The BMW i5 Touring is an incredibly comfortable and refined car, and the practical boot is the icing on the cake Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Regardless, the way the BMW i5 Touring chews through those miles is incredibly impressive, because it’s one of the most comfortable, quiet and refined cars on sale today. You feel utterly cocooned from the outside world. That means it’s a great motorway cruiser, but also means pothole-riddled inner-city roads and bumpy B-roads do little to unsettle the car. It’s fairly composed going around corners, with little in the way of body roll, but you really do feel its weight, so it’s not a car that encourages you to drive it like a sports car. However, if you’re looking for a comfortable and refined car to cruise around in, the BMW i5 Touring has very few weak points, most of which are worthy sacrifices for something so comfortable and practical.

mg,mg3,"What Car? says...At a time when many manufacturers are removing their small car offerings from the market, MG decided to give the MG3 a whole new lease of life.Now, that might seem a bit strange but there's actually good logic behind it. You see, with the Ford Fiesta going off sale, it’s the perfect time for a new version of the well-priced MG3 to swoop in and take a piece of the action.Better still, while the MG3 has always been one of the cheapest small cars you can buy and come with plenty of standard equipment, it's now available with hybrid technology to help improve performance and efficiency.MG3 video reviewIn theory, that should in turn help it compete against rivals, including the similarly affordable Dacia Sandero and Suzuki Swift, plus big names of the small-car market, such as the Renault Clio, Seat Ibiza, Skoda Fabia and VW Polo.So, is the MG3 now a worthy alternative to the best small cars?OverviewThe hybrid MG3's low pricing gives it a certain appeal, but a Suzuki Swift is cheaper on PCP finance and more efficient in the real world. Add in disappointing practicality, a poor driving position and the fact that most rivals are better to drive, and you've got a small car that's hard to recommend.

At least most of them are, but the new MG ZS is actually cheaper than a Vauxhall Astra.And before you go thinking: ""Yes, but I bet it's a box on wheels with an engine from a lawnmower"", well the latest ZS is actually a fuel-sipping hybrid car and even the cheapest version comes loaded with creature comforts.The MG ZS is surprisingly big too. Even though it undercuts small SUVs like the Ford Puma and Peugeot 2008 on price, it's actually slightly longer than a Nissan Qashqai.

There is one notable exception, though – the MG ZS EV.The ZS EV is effectively an electric car version of the MG ZS – and that small SUV is one of MG's most rounded models to date. While the EV isn’t quite the bargain the petrol-powered car is, the ethos of value for money remains.That makes sense, because ever since MG was relaunched by a Chinese company, the once-famous British sports car brand has concentrated on building value-focused models, with steadily increasing success.MG ZS EV video reviewYou see, while the ZS EV costs lots less than direct rivals, it comes well equipped and impresses when it comes to range, with a Long Range version that can officially manage more than 270 miles.But is the MG ZS EV really the bargain it first appears to be, or would you be better off paying a bit more for, say, a Kia Niro EV or Peugeot e-2008?

You might remember that the HS was restyled not long ago, but as you can see from the photos, this time the changes are more radical.As well as a new look, the HS has been given an updated infotainment system, more standard equipment and the choice of either a regular petrol or a petrol plug-in hybrid (PHEV) engine. MG has also confirmed that a regular hybrid version is just around the corner, bringing a potentially happy medium between the two current engine options.MG HS video reviewSo can the latest MG HS match a Ford Kuga or Mazda CX-5 for sportiness, or the Citroën C5 Aircross and Kia Sportage for practicality?

Well, the MG4 EV is actually cheaper than many petrol or hybrid equivalents.In fact, it's cheaper even than the other electric car offerings from MG – the MG5 EV and the MG ZS EV – both of which are famously value-focused in their own right.Surely, then, the bargain-basement pricing (in electric car terms, at least) must mean the MG4 has a tiny range between charges, a cramped interior and not much equipment on offer?

And that's exactly what MG has done with its new MG S5 EV.The S5 EV is the direct replacement for the capable but not particularly inspiring MG ZS EV and it’s built using the same underpinnings as the impressive MG 4 electric hatchback. You know, the one that outsold almost everything else in the UK last year when it came to private electric car buyers.Those underpinnings are crucial. Because not only is the rear-wheel-drive MG 4 a decent handling car (unlike the front-wheel-drive ZS EV) but it also allows MG to use the batteries and motors from its dominant hatchback. And thanks to that you can expect a decent range, punchy performance and great value. MG S5 EV video reviewHowever, the S5 EV faces stronger competition than the model it replaces. At the affordable end, you’ve got fresh-faced small electric SUV rivals like the Jeep Avenger Electric, Kia EV3 and Smart #1.

After all, who expects to spot a dolphin while they're passing the time on a long motorway journey?But there’s more to this fish-out-of-water story. The Dolphin is a small electric car that sits alongside the BYD Atto 3, the BYD Seal and the BYD Sealion 7 in the Chinese car maker's range of electric vehicles.And while its name is a little quirky, the Dolphin offers something the car industry is striving towards: an affordable way in to electrified motoring. Car brands from China have pretty much nailed it, and we've seen the same ethos applied to the MG4 EV and the GWM Ora 03 (formerly the Funky Cat).BYD Dolphin video reviewBYD gives you a choice of three power outputs and two battery sizes, with the biggest battery and motor giving you enough range to rival the MG4 Long Range and a hot hatch rivalling 0-62mph sprint time.It all sounds very promising, but the big question remains – is this a fitting addition to the electric car market, or will the name just be an anecdote to alleviate boredom on long trips?

Well, the cheaper versions compete with the likes of the sporty Ford Puma, the affordable Seat Arona and the spacious Skoda Kamiq.Volkswagen T-Roc video reviewPricier examples, with more powerful engines and fancier trims, push into the premium-badge territory of the Audi Q2 and the Mini Countryman.The question is, should you choose the T-Roc over any of those rival small SUVs? What’s more, is it a better car than its Volkswagen stablemates, the VW T-Cross – which is a similar size – and the sleeker-looking VW Taigo?

volkswagen,t-cross,"What Car? says...At first glance, the Volkswagen T-Cross doesn't seem like a model VW really needs in its line-up.After all, alongside the T-Cross you'll find the VW Taigo – which is basically a T-Cross with a sleeker roof – and the slightly larger VW T-Roc. Indeed, you might even find yourself trying to choose between these three small SUVs.Look a little closer, though, and you'll see there are some key differences. The T-Cross is available with less-powerful engines and more spartan trim levels, for example, so it can be significantly cheaper to buy if you select your spec carefully. It also has some clever tricks, including sliding rear seats, so in some ways it's a more versatile car.Volkswagen T-Cross video reviewIf you're trying to find the best small SUV for your needs, you might also be considering the Skoda Kamiq (which shares many of its parts with the T-Cross) or the Nissan Juke. There's also the fun-to-drive Ford Puma to consider.So, is the VW T-Cross the best choice, or would you better off with on one of its rivals? Read on to find out...",Whatcar

You know the one we’re talking about – the iconic Golf.The current Polo is the biggest and best to drive yet, so while it remains a small car, it's far from overshadowed by VW's incredibly popular family car. Add to that a classy, roomy interior and a range of petrol engines to choose from, and it's hardly surprising that it's a huge seller in its own right.Those traits also help the Polo to stand out against a seriously accomplished crowd of rivals, including the very practical Honda Jazz, the sporty Seat Ibiza and the comfort-focused Skoda Fabia.So is the VW Polo still a contender among the best small cars out there? That’s what we’ll tell you in this review – read on to find out how we rate it.OverviewThe VW Polo is a great all-rounder that's smart, comfortable and roomy inside, and good to drive. While it has a higher list price than some small cars, that’s largely offset by competitive monthly finance rates and strong resale values.

Like the Austral, it’s available with a 1.6-litre hybrid petrol engine – but you can also have your Clio as a 1.0-litre petrol.Of course, the Clio isn't the only small car you can get with hybrid tech these days – the Honda Jazz and Toyota Yaris have been using it for years.Renault Clio video reviewThere are also plenty of rivals with non-hybrid petrol engines in this hotly contested class, ranging from the Audi A1 and Skoda Fabia to the Suzuki Swift and VW Polo.

renault,5-e-tech,"What Car? says...The Renault 5 isn’t the first car from a bygone era to make a comeback, but we reckon it could prove just as successful as other efforts (including the reimagined Fiat 500 and Mini). Indeed, the hatchback that took the small car market by storm in the early 70s has been reinvented for the modern era – although just like the original, the new Renault 5 aims to offer stylish, versatile and affordable motoring for the masses.The biggest change, other than perhaps the increase in size and safety provisions, is what powers the Renault 5. The original was designed to sip fuel during the first oil crisis but this latest model doesn’t use any petrol at all – it’s a fully electric car.Renault 5 video reviewThe 5 isn’t the only small electric car with lofty ambitions of course.

renault,symbioz,"What Car? says...The Renault Symbioz name might sound like it was invented to give Countdown players the fear but it makes sense for this hybrid family SUV.You see, it's derived from symbiosis – meaning living and working well together – and that's pretty apt given that the Symbioz needs to flourish in Renault’s busy SUV line-up. It's one of a handful of SUVs the brand now sells, ranging from the Renault Captur to the Renault Austral.In fact, you could think of the Symbioz as a lovechild of those two SUVs: it's built on the same underpinnings as the Captur but is much closer in size to the Austral.What about rivals? Well, the best known is the Nissan Qashqai but there are plenty of others, including the Hyundai Tucson and Kia Sportage. Or if you can do without full-hybrid tech, there's also the Mazda CX-5, Seat Ateca and Skoda Karoq.Is the Renault Symbioz up to the job of challenging the best family SUVs? Let's find out...OverviewThe Renault Symbioz undercuts the likes of the Nissan Qashqai on price and it's hybrid engine delivers impressive real-world fuel economy.

Likewise, while the all-electric Renault Megane E-Tech is like no other Megane before it, its familiar name might attract potential buyers new to electric cars.From photos it can be tricky to judge the size of the Megane because it looks like a hatchback, but one that’s also wearing chunky, SUV-like styling. However, in reality it's actually closer in size to the MG4 than, say, the Kia EV6.That plus the change in power source means that while the previous-generation Megane was a rival to big-name family cars such as the Ford Focus and VW Golf, the latest model is up against the likes of the Cupra Born and VW ID 3.Renault Megane E-Tech video reviewSo how does the Renault Megane E-Tech compare with rivals for range, performance, practicality and so on? Read on to find out how we rate it against the best electric cars...OverviewThe Renault Megane E-Tech is well worth considering if you're looking for an electric car that’s comfortable and quiet to drive on motorways.

renault,austral,"What Car? says...Sometimes it’s refreshing to just have a massive clearout. You know, throw away all the clothes you don’t wear, or give away whatever superfluous tat you may have accumulated over the years to a charity shop so you can start afresh. And it was perhaps similar thinking that led to the Renault Austral.This family SUV is the successor to the Renault Kadjar, retaining almost nothing from its predecessor. Plus, there are no traditional engines in the Austral line-up; all versions get a regular hybrid set-up that allows you to drive short distances on electric power alone.Of course, the Austral is far from the only family SUV that comes as a hybrid. For example, you might also consider the Honda ZR-V and Kia Sportage. Or, alternatively, the latter is available as a plug-in hybrid (PHEV) with a much longer electric range – as is the Hyundai Tucson and Toyota C-HR.So, is the Renault Austral good enough to rank among the best family SUVs available in the UK right now?

renault,captur,"What Car? says...The smallest member of a family often copies their bigger brothers or sisters – and the Renault Captur has done the same. You see, it now looks more like Renault's larger SUVs than ever.Visually, the latest Captur mimics the Renault Rafale and the electric Renault Scenic rather than looking like a jacked-up Renault Clio (a criticism you might have levelled at previous versions of the Captur). It's been updated in other ways too, with the addition of a new Google-based infotainment system and interior materials Renault says are more sustainable. The upholstery in the new range-topping Esprit Alpine trim, for example, apparently contains 26% recycled and recyclable fabric.Renault Captur video reviewThe 2024 updates were definitely needed to help the Captur stay competitive in the dog-eat-dog world of the best small SUVs – but are they enough?Read on to find out how the latest Renault Captur stacks up against rivals ranging from the Ford Puma and Skoda Kamiq to the Toyota Yaris Cross and VW T-Cross...",Whatcar

Okay, it's not exactly a Range Rover but it does offer a higher driving position than a regular hatchback, along with chunkier styling.The Scenic also continues the tradition of being a more practical alternative to the Renault Megane (which is now an electric car too) and the bigger of two batteries it's available with offers an impressively long range between charges.Renault Scenic video reviewThe Renault Scenic is a bit smaller (and cheaper) than alternatives such as the Kia EV6 and Tesla Model Y but it's slightly larger than the Kia Niro EV.

renault,rafale,"What Car? says...Cars inspired by planes are nothing new but the Renault Rafale we're reviewing here has one of the best claims to fame. It’s named after the Caudron-Renault Rafale – a 1934 racing plane that resulted from Louis Renault’s fascination with speed and flying.The winged Rafale broke records and won awards, and we imagine Renault would love to replicate its success with the four-wheeled version we're reviewing here. To help it out, the Rafale (car) has underpinnings part-developed by sports-car maker Alpine and a choice of two hybrid engines.The thing is, though, the Rafale is entering a competitive market and is up against the similarly sleek Cupra Formentor and Peugeot 408 as well as the premium-badged Audi Q3 Sportback and BMW X2. So does it have what it takes to stand out?Read on as we compare the Renault Rafale with its main family SUV rivals...OverviewThe Renault Rafale impresses when it comes to standard equipment, interior quality and efficiency, but it's not as sharp to drive or comfortable as some of its less-expensive rivals.

Yes, there are coupé SUVs with big price tags – but the Arkana isn't one of them.The Arkana gives you slinky styling, a healthy dash of practicality and the raised driving position SUV buyers adore, all at a price that’ll have you slapping your back pocket in appreciation. Plus it's a regular hybrid so your petrol bills should be manageable too.Sadly for Renault, it's not the only relatively affordable family SUV with coupé styling. Potential buyers will also want to check out another hybrid model, the Toyota C-HR, along with the BMW X2, the Cupra Formentor and the VW Taigo.Read on to find out how we rate the Renault Arkana against the best family SUVs...OverviewIf you want an affordable coupé SUV that’s decently practical and efficient, the Renault Arkana delivers, but it's not particularly brisk and the ride is on the firm side.

renault,zoe,"What Car? says...The Renault Zoe Van has several things going for it, chiefly that it’s cheap to run and can take you further than any other electric powered van.Despite those positives, this Zoe isn't really a van as you know it. Like the rival Ford Fiesta Van, this small hatchback is a rear-seats-out conversion from the passenger car, with a mesh bulkhead and flat floor.That makes it a very small car-based van, with a load volume of just 0.51m3 and a maximum payload of just 387kg – by comparison, the Ford Fiesta Van has just under 1m3 and a 530kg payload allowance.Power comes from an electric motor producing 107bhp, while the battery is a 52kWh pack that is capable of taking you up to 245 miles on a single charge. The option of specifying it with a fast charging system of up to 50kW also means that an 80% charge can be added in just 70 minutes. Alternatively the Zoe Van is fitted with a so-called Chameleon charger, which can adapt 3kW to 22kW supplies.Other, larger rivals for the Zoe van include the Fiat Fiorino and the now discontinued but much-missed Vauxhall Corsavan.",Whatcar

Now this third-generation 3008 combines elements of a family SUV with a sleeker coupé SUV roofline for a more eye-catching ""fastback"" look.Initially, the new 3008 is available with a hybrid petrol engine and a choice of two well-equipped trim levels. There’s also an all-electric version for the first time (to read about that see our Peugeot e-3008 review).Of course, the 3008 isn't the only fastback-style SUV on sale so this all-new model will face competition from quite a few well-established rivals. They range from the Audi Q3 Sportback and BMW X2 to the Renault Arkana and Renault Rafale. There’s also the Cupra Formentor and Peugeot 408 to consider.",Whatcar
peugeot,e-3008,"What Car? says...Like Doctor Who, Peugeot's 3008 has been through several regenerations. It started out as an MPV before transforming into an SUV and then its current ""Fastback"" form. An even bigger change is that it's now available in an all-electric version – the Peugeot e-3008.The e-3008 – which Peugeot calls as a Fastback because of its coupé styling – was designed from the ground up as an electric car and sits on a newly designed platform. There's a choice of power outputs and battery sizes (or, if you're not quite ready to go fully electric, you can get the hybrid or plug-in hybrid Peugeot 3008).Of course, the e-3008 isn't the first electric SUV to hit the market, so it will face competition from quite a few well-established rivals. They include the Kia EV6, Tesla Model Y and Volvo EC40.So is the Peugeot e-3008 a worthy challenger to the best electric SUVs out there and would we recommend buying one? Let's find out...OverviewThe Peugeot e-3008 has a smart interior, competitive charging speeds and a good range by class standards. However, it doesn’t perform as well as some rivals in areas such as comfort, space and practicality. If you do buy one, we recommend sticking with the entry-level Allure trim because it has plenty of standard equipment and keeps the costs down.Smart interiorGood rangeFlexible rear seatsUnsettled rideFiddly infotainment systemLimited leg and head room in the backPerformance & driveWhat it’s like to drive, and how quiet it isStrengths+Long range+Decent performance+Quiet on the moveWeaknesses-Fidgety ride-Lots of travel in the brake pedal-Cumbersome handlingThe entry-level Peugeot e-3008 has a 73kWh (usable capacity) battery providing power to a 207bhp motor that drives the front wheels.",Whatcar
peugeot,5008,"What Car? says...The story of the Peugeot 5008 is rather like that of the ugly duckling. Once upon a time, the popularity of this family-friendly seven-seater was undermined by awkward looks, but then it morphed into something more desirable – in this case, from an MPV to an SUV.Now in its third generation, the 5008 is arguably more striking than ever, but it's not just its appearance that’s changed. The conventional petrol and diesel engines it was previously sold with have now been binned in favour of two hybrid options and an electric version that you can read about in our separate Peugeot e-5008 review.While the e-5008 has few direct rivals, there are a lot of alternatives if you’re considering one of the hybrid 5008s. They include two models that are closely related to each other – the Hyundai Santa Fe and Kia Sorento – plus the Skoda Kodiaq.In this review, then, we’ll look at how the Peugeot 5008 compares with those cars in all the key areas – everything from comfort and quality to practicality and costs – to see if it's now the best seven-seater you can buy.",Whatcar
peugeot,e-5008,"What Car? says...Electric cars that can seat seven people are as rare as black rhinos – and that presents the new Peugeot e-5008 with a big opportunity to steal a march on other brands.You see, while there are now electric SUVs in virtually every manufacturer’s car model line-up, very few have seven seats. The e-5008's rivals are either much more expensive – as the Kia EV9, Volkswagen ID Buzz LWB and Volvo EX90 are – or can't go far on a charge (see the Vauxhall Vivaro Life Electric and other electric MPVs).The e-5008, though, has a competitive starting price and is available with a choice of battery sizes, including a version with an impressive official range of up to 413 miles.Peugeot e-5008 video reviewWhile it's based on the Peugeot e-3008, the e-5008 is bigger and comes with seven seats as standard in every trim. You can also buy regular hybrid and plug-in hybrid versions (to read about those see our Peugeot 5008 review).Of course, being a seven-seater isn’t enough alone to make the Peugeot e-5008 a recommendable car.

peugeot,e-rifter,"What Car? says...Considering that the Peugeot e-Rifter has SUV-inspired styling, up to seven seats and is an all-electric vehicle, you’d be forgiven for thinking it’ll be expensive.But no – the e-Rifter is available for a third of the price of the most notable vehicle that fulfils all those criteria, the Tesla Model X. That puts it in the same league as the Nissan e-NV200 Combi, as well as the Citroën e-Berlingo and Vauxhall Combo-e Life.Now, those last two electric van-based MPVs are identical in many ways to the e-Rifter, so you might wonder why we haven't simply written one review for all three and left it at that. Well, there are lots of differences too, and we'll explain them over the next few pages to help you decide which car is best for you.For starters, Peugeot has given the e-Rifter plenty of SUV styling cues to make it the most rugged-looking of the three. All models have lots of black plastic on the outside to shrug off small knocks, and top-spec models even have roof bars on the, er, roof.",Whatcar
peugeot,e-traveller,"What Car? says...Praise be to the Peugeot e-Traveller because you can now drive your extended family through London without burning fossil fuels or having to resort to one of those expensive horse-drawn carriages.Yes, you read that right: this very large eight-seat (or seven, if configured as such) van-based MPV is actually an electric vehicle. The e-Traveller is not only quiet enough to avoid startling the horses trotting down The Mall, but also avoids the congestion charge.Instead of using a diesel engine (as is traditional with van-based MPVs), you get an electric motor with up to 134bhp. The motor gets its juice from a 50kWh battery pack that you can charge at a rate of up 100kW if you can find a charger capable of that speed.The e-Traveller's body and electric tech are essentially the same as you’ll find in a Citroën e-Spacetourer and Vauxhall Vivaro-e Life. If you’re wondering where this Peugeot fits into that hierarchy, just know that both those rivals have stripped-out and rather basic entry-level versions to keep the price low, while the e-Traveller is 'the posh one', aiming to take on the Mercedes EQV.",Whatcar

bmw,1-series,"What Car? says...The design team behind the latest BMW 1 Series seem to have adopted a Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS) philosophy – and with good reason.When the first-generation 1 Series debuted, it was a proudly unconventional family car with a sporty rear-wheel-drive lay-out, bold styling and a wide range of engines, including a punchy six-cylinder petrol.While those features thrilled driving enthusiasts, they didn’t always appeal to the car’s primary target: families. So with the third-generation 1 Series BMW shifted to a more practical front-wheel-drive layout (with the option of four-wheel drive for certain variants).BMW 1 Series video reviewNow, as part of the 1 Series' latest facelift, BMW decided to simplify the 1 Series package further.

In fact, while people carriers used to be the high-rise wagon of choice for families, most now go for something that looks a bit more like an off-roader. To that end, car manufacturers have been focusing on creating SUVs that fit all niches and have taken their eyes off the MPV ball. BMW hasn’t. Instead, it’s looking to tempt families out of small SUVs with its own sporty-looking MPV, the 2 Series Active Tourer. That won’t be easy though, and it’ll take more than just good aesthetics and a premium badge on the nose. So what’s on offer? Well, BMW has equipped it with a class-leading interior and loads of standard equipment.The 2 Series Active Tourer also comes with the choice of a petrol engine with two different power outputs and mild-hybrid assistance or a diesel option.

bmw,x5,"What Car? says...When the BMW X5 burst on to the scene more than two decades ago, it kicked off the craze for sportier SUVs that felt more like saloons than off-roaders to drive.Indeed, with the X5, BMW changed the face of the luxury SUV landscape overnight. The model went on to dominate sales charts (as well as the Best SUV category at our annual Car of the Year awards and its category at our Tow Car Awards).Unsurprisingly, it didn’t take long for rival manufacturers to respond. The Volvo XC90 joined the crowd first, bringing with it seven seats as standard.Then the Range Rover Sport came along, offering a triple threat: sportiness, luxury and proper off-roading abilities. Later, the Audi Q7 impressed us with its blend of seven-seat versatility, remarkable comfort and a truly classy interior.So, how does this fourth-generation BMW X5 rank among the best luxury SUVs? Read on to find out...OverviewThe BMW X5 is a smooth, classy and luxurious SUV. It's not quite as practical as the most spacious rivals out there but it's good enough where it counts, and where it really impresses is the quality of its lavish interior and superb infotainment system. The xDrive50e plug-in hybrid with M Sport trim is the one to go for.Fantastic plug-in hybrid versionGreat to driveClassy, well-designed interiorWide standard tyres generate road noise at speedThird row of seats costs extraThere are more spacious and practical rivalsNew car deals Best price from £62,990Estimated from £890pmAvailable nowFrom £62,990Leasing dealsFrom £764pm Our Pick Bmw X5 xDrive50e M Sport 5dr Auto review Read our version reviewRRP £73,450See the full rangePerformance & driveWhat it’s like to drive, and how quiet it isStrengths+Punchy performance+Smooth engines+Strong battery range in PHEVWeaknesses-Slightly more road and suspension noise than rival-Firmer ride than more luxurious alternativesEngine, 0-60mph and gearboxThe entry-level engine for the BMW X5 is called the xDrive30d.

bmw,x6,"What Car? says...Finding a truly unique car is rare, but the BMW X6 used to be just that. When the original version was launched, we'd never seen a vehicle that combined a chunky SUV body with the kind of sleek, sloping roofline you’d usually see on a sporty coupé.The X6's coupé SUV concept divided opinion from the start, and while it's now in its third generation, it continues to do so today. To some people it's a car that simply makes no sense because it’s more expensive and less practical than the BMW X5 it’s based on. To others, its blend of function and form makes it very desirable.What’s clear, though, is that there are enough coupé SUV fans out there for the X6 to have become a trend-setter, with a host of manufacturers now selling rivals. The Audi Q8 and Mercedes GLE Coupé for example both owe their existence to it, as do the Porsche Cayenne Coupé and Range Rover Velar.Just how good is the latest BMW X6 though, and how does it compare with the best coupé SUVs?

bmw,x7,"What Car? says...The BMW X7 is kind of a big deal. So big, in fact, it lets you arrive at an event in a vehicle that seems larger than the venue – and you can take six people along for the ride.You see, the X7 is the biggest car BMW makes, and it traverses two car classes – seven-seaters and luxury cars. As well as offering seemingly endless interior space, it aims to pamper its driver and passengers as attentively as the BMW 7 Series luxury limo.But is the BMW X7 really good enough to tempt you away from other premium-badged seven-seaters, including the Audi Q7, Mercedes GLS and Range Rover?BMW X7 Video ReviewWell, we've tested it extensively, and in this review we’ll run you through how well the BMW X7 stacks up for practicality, comfort and refinement, as well as how much it costs to buy and run. Read on to find out everything you need to know...OverviewThe BMW X7 is everything a big luxury SUV should be. It's supremely comfortable and quiet on the move, and its huge interior is as practical as it is sumptuous.

bmw,ix,"What Car? says...The BMW iX is unquestionably the most radical and technologically advanced BMW electric car since the i3 was revealed more than a decade ago.In fact, you can see the lessons learned from the groundbreaking i3 all over the iX. For starters, it’s constructed using a generous dose of aluminium, high-strength steel and plastic reinforced with carbon-fibre.The iX, though, is a luxury electric SUV and should prove far more usable because of its much longer electric range, bigger interior and boot, and extensive list of equipment. There’s even a super-fast and sporty M70 version for those wanting maximum performance.BMW iX video reviewDoes all that stand the BMW iX in good stead against electric rivals – including the Mercedes EQE SUV and Volvo EX90 – or traditional luxury SUVs such as the Audi Q7, the Mercedes G-Class and the Range Rover? Read on to find out…OverviewThe BMW iX combines attention-grabbing styling with a soothing and opulent interior. It’s also spacious, quick and extremely quiet. We’d stick with the entry-level xDrive45, due to its standard equipment and decent range, and use the savings over other versions to add the optional air suspension.One of the quietest cars we’ve ever testedSpacious and luxurious interiorGreat infotainment systemAir suspension only standard on top-spec M70Fiddly air-con controlsQuicker depreciation than rivalsNew car deals Best price from £66,900Estimated from £919pmAvailable nowFrom £66,900Leasing dealsFrom £786pmPerformance & driveWhat it’s like to drive, and how quiet it isStrengths+xDrive60 has really impressive official range+Cosseting ride comfort on higher-spec versions+Hushed road mannersWeaknesses-Not the most agile-Regenerative braking can be a bit hit and missThe BMW iX is the result of some complex engineering but the model line-up is refreshingly simple.

bmw,i4,"What Car? says...If you’re eyeing up an electric car but don’t fancy broadcasting it to the world, the BMW i4 could be for you. While BMW’s first proper stab at an all-electric model – the quirky i3 – was all about looking like it came from a sci-fi flick, the i4 is more understated.It's essentially an electric version of the BMW 4 Series Gran Coupé – and that’s no bad thing. The 4 Series and its close sibling, the BMW 3 Series, are pretty much the benchmarks for their respective classes, so the i4 has a solid foundation.BMW’s offering comes in three flavours. At the more modest end, you’ve got the i4 eDrive35, with a 67kWh battery and a rear motor. That version goes up against the Tesla Model 3 RWD and Polestar 2 Standard Range.BMW i4 video reviewThen there’s the i4 eDrive40, which adds a heftier 80.7kWh battery, a more potent rear motor, and squares up with the Model 3 Long Range and the Polestar 2 LR. At the top of the tree? The M50 – with two motors, four-wheel drive, and ready to take on the Model 3 Performance and Polestar 2 LR Dual Motor.",Whatcar
bmw,i5,"What Car? says...While many people dream of being driven around in a luxury limo, few of us will ever be able to afford either the car or a chauffeur. The BMW i5 might be the answer: it promises first-class comfort at a more attainable business-class price.You see, the i5 is the all-electric version of the BMW 5 Series executive saloon. Indeed, the two look almost identical – the i5 wears a few ""i"" badges and has blanked-off front vents that help boost aerodynamics, but that’s about it.The line-up is simple, with a standard eDrive40 model and a sportier M60 xDrive to choose from. Whichever i5 you go for, you get an 81.2kWh (usable capacity) battery that should be good for around 250-300 miles in real-world driving.BMW i5 video reviewSo, what else might you be considering if you want an electric luxury car? Well, the Mercedes EQE is the i5's main rival, but if you can spend a bit more, you could also look at the Porsche Taycan – a sporty take on the electric saloon.",Whatcar
bmw,i5-touring,"What Car? says...Part of the appeal of luxury products has traditionally been their exclusivity, and yet prestige SUVs seem to be everywhere these days. So what do you buy if you want something big and upmarket that isn’t omnipresent? Well, the BMW i5 Touring might fit the bill.As an estate version of the fully electric BMW i5 executive car, this model’s closest rival is the Porsche Taycan Sport Turismo. But they’re far from direct competitors, with the i5 Touring having a less sporting focus and a much bigger boot.If the latter quality is important to you, you might also have the conventionally powered Mercedes E-Class Estate on your shortlist. Plus, it’s worth noting that the i5 will soon be joined in the BMW 5 Series Touring line-up by new 530e plug-in hybrid (PHEV) and 520i petrol variants.Here, though, it’s the i5 Touring we’re focusing on, as we compare it with the main rivals and look at everything from how good it is to drive to how practical it really is.OverviewThe BMW i5 Touring is a practical, hushed and luxurious choice. Plus, it’s surprisingly affordable to run as a company car, thanks to its low benefit-in-kind tax rating. It’s just a pity its high starting price will rule it out for a lot of private buyers.Practical and well builtA very quiet cruiserTidy handlingAn expensive private buyYou’ll want to add optionsRange is good rather than greatNew car deals Best price from £58,084Estimated from £774pmAvailable nowFrom £58,084Leasing dealsFrom £658pm Our Pick Bmw I5 250kW eDrive40 Sport Edition 84kWh 5dr Auto review Read our version reviewRRP £69,955See the full rangePerformance & driveWhat it’s like to drive, and how quiet it isStrengths+Punchy performance+Hushed road manners+Agile handlingWeaknesses-Suspension could be more supple-Unspectacular rangeTwo versions of the BMW i5 Touring are available: the performance-focused M60, with its twin electric motors (for four-wheel drive) and 593bhp output, and the single-motor eDrive40 model that we tested, which is rear-wheel drive and produces a still healthy 335bhp.",Whatcar
