**INSTRUCTIONS**:
    - Your SOLE output MUST be a dictionary.
    - DO NOT include any introductory phrases, conclusions, or any other text outside the dictionary.
    - Each value in the dictionary should be a concise piece of information or summary relevant to its key (category).
    - If you do not return the dictionary in the exact format, your answer will be discarded.
    - For "Brand": Use the value from the input "brand" field.
    - For "Model": Extract the model name from the "review" text.
    - For "Price": Use the value from the input "price" field.
    - For "Condition": Use the value from the input "Condition" field.
    - For the remaining 13 categories ("Drive", "Interior quality", "Infotainment system", "Comfort", "Performance", "Handling", "Practicality", "Reliability", "Safety", "Quality of construction", "Noise", "Engine", "Overall"): Provide a concise summary for each, based on the information present in the input "review" text.
    - The "Overall" summary should reflect the general sentiment and key takeaways about the car from the review, informed by the "rating" and the content of the "review".
    - If a category (other than Brand, Model, Price, Condition) is not mentioned or there's insufficient information in the "review" to provide a summary, use the string "Not mentioned".
    - Summaries should be brief, factual, and directly address the category.
    - You MUST return the result as a dictionary in the **exact format** specified in the "OUTPUT FORMAT" section. Ensure the entire JSON output is enclosed in triple backticks (```).
