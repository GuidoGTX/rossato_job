MG pulled an absolute blinder with the MG4, and much like the lovable underdog in a boxing movie it punches well above its weight division. It’s more affordable than alternatives such as the Renault Megane E-Tech and Cupra Born , costing around the same as the smaller Vauxhall Corsa Electric and Fiat 500e . You’d be forgiven for thinking that MG have taken a ‘cheap and cheerful’ approach to engineering the MG4, but that’s far from the truth. So far from it, in fact, that the MG4 received high commendations in the 2024 Carwow Car of the Year Awards’ Outstanding EV and Urban Living categories. Just look at it, a mix of pointy details, sharp creases and funky shapes such as the lower body cladding and split roof spoiler. It’s a refreshing looking thing; it still stands out against newer MGs such as the MG S5 and MG HS as much as it does its alternatives. Range: 218-331 miles Efficiency: 3.6-3.8 miles per kWh Battery size: 51kWh / 62kWh / 74kWh Max charge speed: 150kW Charge time AC: 6hrs 12mins, 10-100%, 7kW / 7hrs 30mins, 10-100%, 7kW / 9hrs, 10-100%, 7kW Charge time DC: 39mins, 10-80%, 150kW / 35mins, 10-80%, 150kW Charge port location: Left rear Power outputs: 170hp / 204hp / 245hp It’s a shame the interior isn’t quite as novel, with a dashboard layout that’s so simple it verges on boring, but the material quality, fit and finish and standard kit is better than you might expect for the price. A 10.25-inch infotainment display comes as standard on all trim levels of the MG4, and though it comes with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, MG’s own software is rather basic. It’s frustrating to operate too, especially on the move, with too many menus to navigate. There’s plenty of room in the MG4 though; plenty of adjustability for you to get comfy behind the wheel and enough head and leg room for tall passengers in the rear - though it’s a bit of a squeeze when you’ve got three in the back. The 363-litre boot capacity trails the Volkswagen ID3 for space, and puts it well behind the Megane E-Tech. The MG4 comes with two battery options, offering 218 claimed miles of range in its most basic trim through to 323 miles for the Trophy Extended Range model. The top-rung MG4 XPower , which we’ve reviewed separately, offers a big power hike over the rest of the trim levels, but makes do with a 239-mile range. Around town the MG4 is easy to potter about in thanks to its light steering, peppy electric motors and most importantly, its comfortable suspension. It takes potholes, speed bumps and cracked roads in its stride, and the same applies to motorways where the MG4 just soaks up the miles with ease. Yet even with its soft suspension the MG4 is rather fun to drive on a twisty road, feeling agile and grippy with little in the way of body lean. The X-Power is particularly rapid, but it’s different enough that we've reviewed it separately here. For a stonking value for money proposition, have a look at our new MG4 deals as well as our MG4 lease deals . You can also check out used MG4s from our network of trusted dealers as well as other used MGs . When it’s time for a change, you can even sell your current car through Carwow. How much is the MG4 EV? How much is the MG4 EV? While the MG4 is a similar size to the Volkswagen ID3 and Volvo EX30 , it comes in much cheaper without feeling like a compromise. Entry-level SE cars are equipped with automatic LED headlights, tinted windows and a leather steering wheel as standard. Trophy cars bump up the standard kit with a heated sterling wheel, adjustable-height boot floor, 18-inch alloy wheels and a bolstered suite of drivers assistance systems with blind spot detection and lane assist on top of the SE’s adaptive cruise control . You can also get the Trophy spec cars in a rather bold orange paint finish with a two-tone black roof. There’s a £10,000 price difference between the entry-level and top-rung MG4 models, so you need to consider whether the extra range and kit is worth it. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort Comfortable in town and surprisingly nimble in bends, but there’s a bit of wind noise on the motorway One of the first things you notice when driving the MG4 is that it’s very comfortable. EVs tend to have stiff suspension because this helps stop cars with heavy batteries from wobbling around in corners, but the MG4 manages to smooth out lumpy roads and speed bumps with little fuss. It’s pretty agile too, thanks to the responsive motors and light steering. There are multiple steering settings in the menus, but putting it in its lightest mode removes so much feel that we’d recommend leaving it in ‘normal’. The 10.7-metre turning circle isn’t quite as good as the VW ID3, but it’s enough to navigate busy urban areas with ease, while good forward visibility is another boon. Rear visibility not so much, though, meaning it can be tricky to see what’s around when looking over your shoulder. Another complaint is the lack of ‘one pedal driving’. The MG4 will not come to a complete stop if you lift off the throttle and let the regenerative braking do its thing, instead creeping along once you get to low speeds. You’ll get used to it, but it’s mildly annoying that you need to use the brakes to stop in traffic, while other EVs will bring the car to a halt. When you do use the brakes, though, they’re smooth and avoid the jerkiness found in some electric cars. Those punchy electric motors are useful out on the motorway too. When accelerating up to the national speed limit the MG4 pulls quickly and smoothly, getting you up to a cruise with little fuss. Once you’re there, the MG4’s soft suspension again makes itself known by proving to be a comfortable companion on long journeys. Minor road imperfections are barely noticeable so you’ll get to your destination feeling relaxed. The MG4 is not the quietest EV at motorway speeds though, with a bit of wind noise to contend with. Meanwhile, that light steering is less welcome at high speeds, though you can increase the weight a bit in the settings. Again the MG4 impresses, and this time it’s in corners. You might expect that soft suspension to mean it’s not particularly confidence-inspiring on a winding road, because there’s usually a trade off between comfort and cornering ability. However, while it’s no sports car , it’s easy to have fun behind the wheel. Pitch the car into a corner and it doesn’t lean too much , so you don’t feel like you might fall into the opposite lane and can instead focus on enjoying the power from the electric motors. We've tested both power outputs and can happily say that each had more than enough oomph to enjoy and, thanks to sending power to the rear wheels, feel agile as you accelerate out of a turn. Despite this corner carving positivity, the MG4 is no hardcore hot hatch replacement and prefers a more laid back approach, encouraging you to get into a rhythm rather than attack corners with rubber-shredding enthusiasm. Space and practicality Space and practicality Decent space and storage up front, but it’s hit and miss in the rear seats and the boot could be bigger Getting comfortable as the driver in the MG4 EV is easy, thanks to electrically operated seats and great steering wheel adjustability, which has a wide range of movements for reach and rake. Once in position there’s a load of space to store whatever’s filling your pockets, with a large bin beneath the armrest, a shallow, coverable space in the centre console and a phone charging pad that sits on a plinth behind the gear selection dial. There are large door bins, a felt-lined glasses storage box and a reasonably sized glovebox, too. The cup holders are a good size and within arm’s reach, but sitting beneath the aforementioned plinth means that it’s tricky to slot bottles in on the move. It could be easy to knock the top off your coffee while keeping your eyes on the road. This section is also quite close to the driver, meaning those with longer legs might find they're resting their knee on the hard plastic, which can get a bit sore on longer trips. Rear passengers are generally well catered for, with subtle cutouts in the roof helping provide ample headroom, while even taller passengers should have no issues with knees banging the seat in front. Foot space is okay but it’s tricky to get your feet under the seat in front. This can make longer journeys uncomfortable as the seat cushion is quite close to the floor of the car, forcing your legs up so your thighs are not supported. Put three adults in the back and it’s a squeeze for shoulder space, while the lack of central armrest is a shame when you don’t have a third person in the middle seat. The door bins are smaller back here and there’s only one USB slot for those in the back to fight over. The mobile phone holders in the back of the seats in front is a cool touch though, while the ISOFIX points are easy to access. Overall rear seat space is fine, but it doesn’t quite feel as polished as it does up front, with cheaper materials, too. At 363 litres the MG4’s boot is not terrible, but does lag a little behind the ID3’s 385 litres and Nissan Leaf’s cavernous 435 litres. However, it is slightly bigger than the BYD Dolphin's 345 litres, and the similarly priced Fiat 500 Electric is much smaller at 185 litres, giving some context to the value proposition here. Fold the rear seats down and you get a decent 1,117 litres of space. Practicality is also not great, with just the one tie-down hook and no 12V charge slot. However, you can store the charging cables beneath the boot floor so you don’t have to eat into cargo space, unlike in the VW, while folding the rear seats down reveals a flat floor that’s easy to push large, heavy items across. Some EVs have a smaller front boot beneath the bonnet, because there’s no need to slot a big petrol or diesel engine in there. However, the MG4 has no extra space up front, which is a bit of a shame. But then neither does the ID3 or Leaf, so it’s not a deal breaker in this class. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior fit and finish is mighty impressive for the price point, but the infotainment can be tricky to use If you’ve sat in an ID3 and been left disappointed by the interior look and quality, the MG4 is sure to surprise you. Despite costing considerably less than its German counterpart, the fit and finish feels more premium thanks to soft-touch materials throughout. The 10.25-inch infotainment screen perched atop the dashboard has a clear display, but the graphics look a touch dated and its response to inputs is quite laggy. Couple this with climate and drive mode control functions buried in menus, and it can be quite fiddly to use on the move. You also only get sat nav on the top-spec Trophy model, but that’s actually not a big deal because wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are included as standard and work better than MG’s system anyway. While there are a few physical buttons beneath the screen, they feel pretty cheap and let the side down when everything else feels so solid. The digital display ahead of the driver is more impressive though, boasting a crisp, clear display and plenty of customisation options, so you can use the wheel-mounted buttons to show the most relevant information to you. There’s also a storage tray for your mobile phone that sits conveniently above the USB slots in the front. This has a hole to feed the wire through to keep things neat, but it’s very fiddly and some wires don’t actually fit through... Electric range, charging and tax Electric range, charging and tax There are five variations of MG4, spanning two trim levels, three battery sizes, and the separate high-performance model called XPower. Entry-level SE models have a 170hp motor and 51kWh battery with a 0-60mph time of 7.5 seconds and a range of 218 miles. Step up to the SE Long Range and Trophy Long Range and you get 203hp with a 64kWh battery, but the extra weight drops the 0-60mph time a fraction to 7.7 seconds. They have a maximum range of 281 and 270 miles respectively. At the top of the range is the Trophy Extended Range model, which has a 77kWh battery and a 323-mile range. It's also the most powerful version (excluding the XPower), with 241hp and a 0-60mph time of 6.5 seconds. The smaller battery can be charged at a rate of up to 117kW, which will top the battery up from 10 to 80% in 39 minutes. The Long Range battery has a 135kW charge rate, meaning it’s slightly quicker from 10 to 80% at 35 minutes. The Extended Range model takes slightly longer to do the same charge at 39 minutes. When we tested the Trophy Long Range model, we achieved a 0-60mph time of 7.1 seconds, which is a good chunk quicker than the official figures suggest. We also saw efficiency of 3.8miles/kWh, which would equate to a range of 232 miles. Although this is down on the official figure, it’s an impressive number for real world driving. During our time with the entry-level SE version, we saw the same efficiency figures, which would put the range of its smaller battery at just under 200 miles. Again, this isn't too far off its claimed figures and a perfectly useful amount for most. As an electric vehicle, the MG4 is subject to the minimum Vehicle Excise Duty of £10 in its first year, then £195 from its second year onwards. It also benefits from very low benefit-in-kind tax , making it an affordable choice for company car buyers. Safety and security Safety and security Even the cheapest MG4 gets MG Pilot as standard, which is a driver assistance package that includes active emergency braking, lane keep assist, driver attention alert and intelligent high beam assist. Trophy models also get door opening warning, blind spot detection, rear cross traffic alert and lane change assist. Even more impressively, this includes adaptive cruise control as standard. This means the car will adapt its speed when approaching slower cars on the motorway, and will even stay in control in stop-start traffic. The MG4 received the full five stars in Euro NCAP safety testing in 2022, scoring over 80% for occupant safety and over 70% in the vulnerable road users and safety assist sections, though the test has become stricter since the MG earned its stars. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems MG came dead last in the 2024 Driver Power reliability survey, which isn’t confidence-inspiring if you’re a prospective owner. EVs tend to be more reliable than petrol and diesel cars, so could be a good bet if you want to avoid worrying about mechanical repairs. There was a 2022 recall for the MG4 locking itself and shutting off the key and windows at a standstill, though that should have been rectified by now. Giving further peace of mind is MG’s excellent seven-year/80,000-mile warranty, so even if something does go wrong, you should be covered. It’s fully transferable too, so if you’re buying a used example you’ll still benefit, providing it falls within the age and mileage limit. MG4 EV FAQs MG4 EV FAQs"
https://www.carwow.co.uk/mg/5,MG5 EV REVIEW & PRICES,"€37,738",6/10,new,"Is the MG5 EV a good car? Is the MG5 EV a good car? This is the MG5 EV, and it’s one of very few electric estate cars currently available in the UK – the others being the Porsche Taycan Sport Turismo , Vauxhall Astra Sports Tourer Electric and Peugeot e-308 SW . It’s a bit like doing your shopping at Lidl or Aldi. On the face of things, you may dismiss the MG5 as simply being a value option - but if you’re clued up, you’ll know there’s much more to it than that. The MG5 was given a design overhaul in 2022 and it was much-needed, though it also came with a small bump in price. The dowdy car of old has been replaced with a stylish new look, sporting sharp lines in the bumpers and wide, narrow headlights. It’s not quite as striking as the Carwow 2023 Car of the Year, the MG4 hatch, though. On the inside, the MG5 isn’t quite as smart either, but it’s a definite improvement over the pre-revision car. Build quality is really good and there’s a respectable amount of plush-feeling materials. Fabric seats come as standard, though range-topping models get a leatherette set. Sitting at the heart of the dashboard is an updated 10.25-inch infotainment system. It’s certainly a leap from the older, sluggish screen and, if you’d rather mirror your smartphone, it comes with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay as standard. It does retain a part-digital, part-analogue driver’s display, though this feels pretty clunky and would work better as a fully digital unit. There’s lots of knee and headroom in the back seats of the MG5, however a raised footwell does leave your rear passengers angled rather awkwardly. As for boot space, you’ve got 580 litres to work with in the MG5. That’s only slightly down on the Toyota Corolla Touring Sports’ 598 litres, so it’s a useful space that will easily carry large suitcases. Choosing the motor and battery is easy, because, well, there is no choice. Whichever MG5 trim you choose you get a battery with a usable capacity of 57kWh and a 156hp motor. That said, driving range is 250 miles in the entry-level SE version or 235 miles in the higher-spec Trophy model, thanks largely to the bigger alloy wheels. The MG5 is comfortable in town and on the motorway, and you get the MG Pilot safety system as standard, which includes assistance kit such as adaptive cruise control and lane-keep assist. If you like the sound of the MG5 EV you can check out the latest new deals now or browse used stock from dealers near you. You can also take a look at other used MG models . Want to sell your car online ? Well, Carwow can help with that too. How much is the MG5 EV? How much is the MG5 EV? While you used to be able to get an MG5 EV for just under £30,000, the latest updates now mean prices start at just over that figure. It’s not a massive hike, but it’s just enough to be frustrating, especially when you consider the much smarter MG4 starts at about £27,000. With so few alternative electric estate cars to consider, it's difficult to decide whether the MG5 is good value for money. The Peugeot e-308 SW and Vauxhall Astra Sports Tourer Electric both start at about £10,000 more than the MG, but are much nicer inside and better to drive. Then there's the lovely Porsche Taycan Sport Turismo, but it is considerably more expensive again. Which you go for is largely dictated by budget, then. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort The MG5 EV has a comfortable ride that puts more expensive cars to shame, but there’s a disappointing amount of wind noise at higher speeds The first thing you’ll notice when driving around town is just how comfortable the MG5 is. It’s really good over rough surfaces and bumps in the road, and actually puts much more expensive cars to shame in this department. Unfortunately, though, it doesn’t have true one-pedal driving, which means that although you can slow the car by simply letting off the accelerator and allowing the regenerative braking to do its thing, you will have to use the brakes to come to a complete halt. On the plus side, there’s none of the grabbiness you get with some electric car brakes, so you can stop smoothly. Visibility is generally decent, though the rear window is quite small. Still, you don’t get massive blind spots so manoeuvring in tight side streets isn’t too stressful, despite the MG5 being pretty long. And when you want to park up, the reversing camera and sensors help, though the display is pretty low resolution. That comfortable suspension is also evident when you get up to motorway speeds. There’s no crashing into bumps in the road and the car irons out imperfections in a way not many electric cars can match. While 156hp won’t make your hair stand on end with excitement, the MG5 packs a surprising punch from about 50mph to 70mph, meaning overtaking slow-moving traffic is a breeze. Speaking of breezes, that brings us onto the main disappointment with the MG5’s motorway manners. One of the appealing aspects of electric motoring is how quiet and serene it is inside, but there’s quite a bit of wind noise in the MG5, so long journeys aren’t quite as relaxing as you might hope. This is an affordable electric family estate with a soft, comfort-focused suspension, so it’s going to become a wallowy mess at the first sight of a corner, right? Well, actually, no, not at all. If you put the car into sport mode it weights up the steering wheel, but this just feels odd so we’d recommend leaving it in its normal setting. Do so, and the MG5 is surprisingly capable in corners. It’s not that it’s exciting, exactly, it just doesn’t lean too much and grips enough to be pretty good fun. You do have to be careful with the throttle out of tight corners, though, as the power has a tendency to overwhelm the front tyres, so you get a little wheelspin. The traction control catches it quickly but it’s just a touch unsettling. Space and practicality Space and practicality Cabin space is generally pretty good, but the high floor makes long trips a bit uncomfortable for passengers all around Roominess up front is pretty good, but the floor sits quite high in relation to the seats, so your knees are high. It’s not the most comfortable position if you’re doing a long journey and it’s something that will also affect your passenger, as it’s tricky to stretch your legs out. Other than that it's mostly positive, with a big glovebox and door bins, and an average but useful space beneath the armrest. There are two USB charging points under the central screen with a shelf that holds even the largest phones. There’s loads of kneeroom and headroom in the back, but again, it’s let down a bit by that high floor. With your knees up high you can’t rest your thighs on the seat cushion and totally relax on long trips. There’s an arm rest that folds down in the middle with a couple of cup holders, while the rear door bins will take a large bottle and the two USB ports mean there’s less fighting over phone charging than in cars with just the one. Because of the space on offer it’s easy to fit a baby seat in the back. The ISOFIX points are tricky to access but once they’re connected there’s plenty of room to manoeuvre. The MG5 has a 580-litre boot, which is a big, useful size that makes it easy to carry a couple of suitcases or the weekly shop. With no direct competitors it’s hard to compare, but the hybrid Toyota Corolla Touring Sports has an extra 20 litres. The MG5 costs a fraction more than a Nissan Leaf , but that’s a hatchback with 435 litres of boot space. The much pricier Volkswagen ID3 has just 385 litres. Fold the rear seats and you get 1,367 litres, which isn’t amazing (the Toyota has over 1,600 litres) but it should be more than enough for most, unless you’re trying to move wardrobes on the regular and need all the space you can get. This slight lack of litreage likely comes from the fact you can’t fold the seats fully flat, so there’s a bit of a slope when you’re pushing longer items through. It’s also a shame there’s no front boot for a little extra storage space, though on the plus side there is some under-floor storage in the boot for your charging cables and load cover. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories The post-2022 interior update has worked wonders, but there are still cheap materials here and there Before the 2022 update, the MG5 EV had a dull, dated cabin that felt like it explained why the car was so cheap. However, updated cars get a sparkly new look, with the old-school infotainment display removed from the dash and lifted to sit atop it. The 10.25-inch display looks much more modern, has a crisper screen and is more responsive than its predecessor, though that’s setting the bar pretty low. The new display has chunky buttons that make it easy to navigate on the move, though some of the climate controls are fiddly. Pre-update cars had physical buttons for this, which is generally better, if less aesthetically pleasing. There’s a 7.0-inch digital dashboard display ahead of the driver that’s incorporated into the traditional analogue dials. It’s kind of clunky to look at and, considering it’s fairly large, it feels like MG could have just gone for a fully digital dash to simplify things and modernise the cabin further. You get Android Auto and Apple CarPlay as standard, and there’s a nifty little shelf beneath the infotainment where you can plug your phone in and keep it secure. Material quality is hit and miss, with some scratchy plastics to be found as you might expect, but there are also some squishy plastics here and there. It’s certainly not utilitarian, and while you get fabric seats in the standard version, there’s perforated synthetic leather upholstery on Trophy models. Electric range, charging and tax Electric range, charging and tax Whatever trim level you opt for you get a 156hp electric motor and a battery with a usable capacity of 57kWh. However, if you want maximum range you’ll need to go for the SE model as that will get you up to 250 miles. Want some extra kit? Opting for the Trophy drops range to 235 miles. The maximum charging speed is 87kW, which will get you from 10-80% capacity in about 35 minutes on a public fast charger. Going from 10-100% on a 7kW home charger takes about 10 hours. Official figures suggest efficiency of 3.6mi/kWh in the SE and 3.5mi/kWh in the Trophy. With zero emissions, you’re paying no vehicle excise duty . Company car drivers will also enjoy the 2% benefit-in-kind rate until 2025. Safety and security Safety and security The key safety feature on the MG5 is MG Pilot. It would be a great standard feature on a car twice the price, and really helps cement this as an excellent family car worthy of consideration. The full suite includes adaptive cruise control with traffic jam assist (so it will stop and start for you), automatic emergency braking, intelligent speed limit assist, lane-keep assist, lane-departure warning and intelligent high beam headlights. Unfortunately, Euro NCAP has not put the MG5 through its rigorous safety testing yet. However, the MG4 got full marks in 2022, while the MG ZS EV scored the same in 2019. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems Because the MG5 hasn’t been on sale too long, it’s difficult to score its reliability as no major issues have cropped up yet. MG has a fairly hit and miss reputation for things going wrong, but its electric cars appear to be proving a hit with buyers, which should be reassuring. As is the warranty. MG offers one of the best available in the UK new car market with its seven-year/80,000-mile coverage. That’s beaten only by Kia, which also offers seven years but covers for up to 100,000 miles."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/mg/zs-ev,MG ZS EV Review & Prices,"€38,616",7/10,new,"Is the MG ZS EV a good car? Is the MG ZS EV a good car? The MG ZS EV is an electric SUV that goes up against the likes of the Hyundai Kona Electric and Kia Niro EV – both of which are now well-established options at the affordable end of the electric car market. It’s a bit like going for a pair of cheap Bluetooth headphones. It might not be from the obvious choice of brands, but it promises to do a similar job at a lower cost. Since its revival as a mass-production manufacturer, MG’s models haven’t been the most exciting to look at. The new ZS EV is in a similar vein, but this updated version now comes with a blanked-out grille and LED headlights as part of a tweaked front end. There is also a new rear bumper with altered lights. MG has also improved the interior design, with the main addition being a new 10.1-inch infotainment touchscreen that has updated software to make it much smoother than before. A 7.0-inch driver display has also been added that offers efficiency and safety information. But where alternatives may offer slightly more comfort and refinement, you’ll find a lot of scratchy plastics alongside the new carbon fibre-effect upholstery finish on the dashboard and leather trim on the seats. In the back, you have decent legroom behind even the tallest of drivers. But as the batteries are mounted under the floor, your knees end up quite high. Headroom is also not the best, with the panoramic sunroof on Trophy models eating into the space even more. Taller passengers may struggle to get comfortable in the back. With an adjustable boot floor as standard, you get 470 litres. This is on par with the Kia Niro EV 's 475 litres, but is 140 litres more than the Hyundai Kona Electric 's offering. Folding the seats down creates a 1,100-litre space, but the seats don’t quite fold flat. The ZS EV comes with two battery options. The 51kWh Standard Range and 72kWh Long Range options offer up to 198 and 273 miles respectively. When driving in the real world across multiple conditions and in all three driving modes – Eco, Normal and Sport – you get closer to 240 miles. But leave it in Normal mode and you’ll get nearer to the claimed figure. Around town, the steering feels light and accurate. It also doesn’t allow many bumps into the cabin at slow speeds, with the suspension setup in normal mode helping it out. On the motorway, you’ll notice a lot of tyre noise and, if you go for the top-spec Trophy version, the roof rails do make a slight whistling noise. It feels comfortable on the whole, but the seats don’t have as much cushioning or support as you might like. When applying Sport mode and tackling a country road, the ZS feels pretty stable. It isn’t the most engaging car in the world and it can scrabble for grip in damper conditions – but for most that won’t be much of an issue. With its competitive pricing and practicality, the ZS EV is a model you should consider. It may not be as refined as alternatives, but it can certainly be a useful option if you’re in the market for an efficient SUV .

How much is the MG ZS EV? How much is the MG ZS EV? MG is much like Dacia in the fact that it's a value brand, and the ZS EV is one of the more affordable EVs around. It successfully undercuts both its main rivals, the Hyundai Kona Electric and Kia Niro EV, while providing more practicality than electric models more expensive than it, like the Volkswagen ID.3 and Cupra Born . Between trims, there's a jump of £2,500 between SE and Trophy models. Choosing the longer range 72kWh battery over the standard range car also incurs a price leap of £2,500. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort It’s not the most exciting electric car to drive, but the ZS EV is comfortable and refined enough for most Since making a return to the market, MG models haven’t been the most thrilling to drive - and it’s the same story here. It’s not bad by any means, though. Where it majors is in town. The light steering helps you manoeuvre through traffic well, while the suspension soaks up many of the bumps you come across. It might feel a little wide down narrower streets, but it feels pretty good most of the time. The ZS comes with battery recovery settings, so you can alter how much the car slows down on its own to recharge. On its highest setting, you can basically drive around town using only the accelerator. When you're on the motorway, the ZS does start to feel a bit unrefined. The roof rails fitted on Trophy models start to whistle at higher speeds. A lot of tyre noise is also created and that does make an impact in the cabin - even with some music on. But saying that, the ZS manages to be comfortable enough on longer trips. All versions come with 17-inch aerodynamically optimised wheels, and they help to keep the car reasonably comfortable on longer journeys. The ZS EV in Sport mode doesn’t feel too top-heavy when you attack a corner, and it’s reasonably stable. That being said, the suspension becomes a little sharp and it does drain the battery quite quickly. One area of annoyance is the placement of the drive mode selection. You have the gear selector as a wheel in the middle of the centre console, with the toggles for drive modes, battery recovery and status. For UK models, the drive mode select is on the wrong side and you’re stretching to choose between Eco, Normal and Sport modes. The ZS also lacks some driver adjustment. You can only move the wheel up and down, with no reach alteration. That can also mean the view of the driver display can be slightly obscured. Space and practicality Space and practicality With a class-leading boot, the ZS EV is super useful. Taller passengers may struggle to get comfortable though As a result of the ZS’ boxy shape, you get a decent amount of headroom in the front and you can stretch your legs out more than enough even with people in the back. With grab handles on the centre console, you can feel supported enough when driving around quicker corners. MG has ensured that the ZS has plenty of cubby holes and spaces throughout the cabin. You have a wireless charging pad for your smartphone in the centre console, as well as cup holders and a storage bin under the armrest. The door bins up front are also a decent size. In the back, taller passengers may struggle a little - especially with the sunroof fitted. The roof slopes quite a lot towards the rear, and with the batteries mounted under the floor, the seats are quite high. Legroom isn’t bad, but a taller driver will restrict knee room slightly. You get seat pockets and door bins, while the cup holders in the middle armrest are covered, which is quite helpful for comfort. You also get two USB-C sockets to charge phones and keep kids occupied with their devices. Compared to alternatives, the MG ZS EV has a well-sized boot. The 480-litre space is slightly smaller than the Kia Niro EV's by five litres but is considerably better than the Hyundai Kona Electric's - by 120 litres. The variable boot floor helps too, with the space underneath keeping the charging cable safe. By folding the rear seats down, you get 1,100 litres to work with. That’s weirdly not as much as some alternatives, but it’s more than enough for most people. The seats also don’t fold completely flat. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories The ZS’s cabin isn’t the most exciting, but the infotainment is much improved and equipment levels are pretty decent The interior finish of the ZS isn’t all that exciting, but it features leather and carbon fibre-effect upholstery throughout. In the top-spec Trophy version, you get contrast stitching against the black leather. You don’t get much else in the way of colour, as the black leather, plastics and trim make it quite a dull interior. The panoramic roof and light headlining do help bring some light into the cabin, but it could be better. With this updated version of the ZS, MG has revamped the infotainment system completely. You get Apple CarPlay and Android Auto , but even if you don’t use them, the setup works very smoothly. The Trophy Connect version we drove features the top version of the iSmart system with live services, such as weather and traffic updates. You can also pre-heat your car, as well as check battery levels and service intervals through the iSmart app. Models also feature a wireless charging pad, six-speaker audio system and Bluetooth connection. Electric range, charging and tax Electric range, charging and tax The sole electric motor is mounted on the front axle and is paired to either a 51kWh or 72kWh battery pack. The smaller battery option provides up to 198 miles of range. For the larger 72kWh option, MG claims a return of 273 miles of charge. Using all three driving modes on a route close to 100 miles for this test, it returned an average of 3.4 miles per kWh – averaging out at 232 miles of range. Most people won’t be flinging their ZS EV down a country road to test how grippy it is and pushing the throttle hard to make the most of its power, so in more restrained driving you can expect close to the claimed mileage. The claimed mileage of similar options on the market is slightly better, with the Niro EV having a supposed range of 285 miles. The Kona Electric has 300 miles available. As you only have a single motor and the car weighs 1,620kg, performance isn’t as rapid as other EVs. But it definitely isn’t slow. The ZS EV can get from 0-60mph in 8.2 seconds, which is more than fast enough for most. Until April 2025, you'll be saving money on tax compared with a petrol car, as EV owners don't need to cough up for it. Beyond that date though, you'll need to be paying the same annual cost as everyone else. Safety and security Safety and security Although the updated ZS EV hasn't been put through its paces by Euro NCAP , the original version scored five stars on its safety tests, performing the best on the occupant metrics (90% on adults and 86% for children). It didn't perform as well on the pedestrian and safety assist tests, but was still good enough to give the ZS EV a good rating. As standard, it comes with adaptive cruise control, lane keep assist, traffic jam assist and intelligent high beam - with the Trophy version also receiving blind spot monitoring and rear cross traffic alert. You also get airbags all round, emergency braking assist, rear Isofix mounting points and an immobiliser. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems The ZS EV hasn't been subject to any recalls since its launch. But the quality of some of the interior materials and finishing touches don't feel too sturdy, so you may need to look out for features breaking or falling apart. MGs registered now will get a 12-month, unlimited mileage warranty. Up to a further six years, you get 80,000 miles under warranty, with the policy transferring to any new owner in that timeframe. For the fourth to seventh years of that warranty, you need to have a full service history to qualify for those additional years."

The MG3 used to be a bit of a joke - the old one was the lowest-ranked car on Carwow - but the new model aims to change all that. Now, instead of being antiquated, it’s right up there with the best small cars for performance, efficiency and equipment. Like an air fryer from the middle of Lidl, the MG3’s feature set is as good as any of its alternatives and it’s not immediately clear where the money’s been saved to bring it in at such a low price. Now that it’s a full self-charging hybrid car , the MG3 no longer targets the very cheapest on the market like the Dacia Sandero or Citroen C3 Origin . Instead, it’s more like a cut-price alternative to the Renault Clio E-Tech or Toyota Yaris - a halfway house for people who want the most efficient small car possible, but either don’t want or can’t have a fully electric model. The MG3 won’t win awards for its practicality - it’s not cramped, but it’s no better than average in this regard with a boot that’s about halfway between the Yaris and the Clio in capacity. Rear seat space is moderate, too, though annoyingly the rear seats don’t split when they fold which does limit overall versatility. The front of the cabin looks great, and very modern - in stark contrast to the car it replaces. Poke around and you can find a few places where MG’s saved money - there’s a sliding cover for one of the storage compartments that feels comically flimsy, and the top of the dash and the door cards are made of hard plastic - but the Clio and the Yaris have areas that feel equally cheap. More importantly, MG’s given the 3 its best touchscreen infotainment system yet, and it’s loaded with equipment - climate control, a digital dashboard, sat-nav and a full suite of assisted driving features are standard on every model. The MG’s hybrid system is brand-new, and puts out an impressive 191hp - versus 140hp for the Clio and up to 130hp for the Yaris. That means it’s easily got any of them beat in a drag race, and makes mincemeat of overtakes or motorway sliproads. It’s not quite as efficient as the alternatives, but you might decide that the additional performance makes the small drop in mpg worthwhile. The real surprise is what happens when you reach a twisty road. The old MG3 was always shockingly good fun in the corners, but unexpectedly MG has managed to repeat the trick. The new MG3 handles brilliantly for a small car, and that makes it one of the most enjoyable small cars to drive. Sound interesting? Check here for our best MG3 deals , or look for a used MG3 on Carwow here. You could also check out other used MGs here, and remember that Carwow can even help you sell your car online too. How much is the MG3? How much is the MG3? The MG3 starts at less than £18,500, which is slightly more than a basic petrol Renault Clio - but undercuts the comparable Clio hybrid by several thousand pounds, and the Toyota Yaris hybrid by even more. Even the top-spec Trophy trim level, a £2,000 uplift over the basic SE, costs less than either of those two cars. Opting for Trophy doesn’t just get you a shinier badge, as it comes with some really tasty equipment upgrades. A full 360-degree camera system is perhaps overkill for a car this small, but LED headlights, keyless entry and heated seats are all worthy additions. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort Hybrid system can be a little clunky, but it’s powerful and reasonably efficient In town The MG3’s hybrid system is more electric than most - by that we mean it uses a comparatively powerful electric motor, and relies on that rather than the petrol engine most of the time. In fact, the MG’s electric motor on its own is more powerful than the Toyota Yaris’ entire hybrid system, and that means that most of the time its engine acts more like a generator, just keeping the battery topped up. Thanks to this, driving round town is extremely smooth because for the most part, it’s done on electric power alone. That doesn’t mean it’s silent like an electric car, though, because the engine needs to be on to keep the battery charged - and it often revs higher than you’d expect with quite a coarse sound. It’s not unbearable, but it is noticeable. The MG3 has quite firm suspension but it’s not uncomfortable round town. It deals well with lumps and bumps, and the steering is light enough although it does feel a little remote. It also has significantly more regen braking than any other hybrid car. On its highest setting it’s almost a one-pedal driving mode, though the on-again, off-again nature can make low-speed manoeuvres a little jerky. On the motorway The extra power you get over a Clio or a Yaris here is a boon when it comes to joining the motorway - where those cars would need quite a lot of throttle to get up to speed on a slip road, leaving their engines at high revs and making a racket, the MG can do it in a relatively relaxed fashion. If you do put your foot down, you can feel where the hybrid system starts to get clunky. With just a three-speed gearbox on the engine, gear changes feel like they take an age, so the power delivery has pronounced dips as the electric motor tries to fill the gap. During normal driving though, you won’t notice it. It feels stable and comfortable, and the engine settles down unless you’re really going for it. All MG3s include adaptive cruise control and a suite of safety equipment to make motorway driving more relaxing. The adaptive cruise works okay, but it’s a bit hyperactive, slowing you down miles before you get close to another car. The lane-keeping aids can be rather eager, too. And a word to the warning that you’ll want to turn off the average speed camera alerts in the sat-nav menu - they’re ear-splittingly loud. On a twisty road The old MG3 handled corners absolutely brilliantly - and despite its bigger frame and additional complexity, the new car does so too. It has oodles of grip when cornering hard, so you really feel confident to fling it into bends with gay abandon, and have a lot of fun while doing so. You can flip the car into Sport mode, which makes the powertrain feel even more eager but does add some unnatural-feeling weight to the steering. Even when you’re giving it some beans, the MG3 tackles bumps pretty well, and it’s more likely to put a smile on your face than either the Renault Clio or the Toyota Yaris. Space and practicality Space and practicality Comfortably average in the space department but with a few practicality niggles Front seat occupants have a pretty good time in the MG3 with fairly comfortable and supportive seats. There’s not much adjustment for the driver, though - while the seat does have height adjustment, there’s no variable lumbar support and nor is there reach adjustment for the steering wheel, which is particularly disappointing. Storage is good, though - there’s a big glovebox, a tray in front of the gear selector plus two large cupholders. Under the arm rest there’s a big storage compartment too, though the cover for this is extremely flimsy. Space in the back seats Two adults can just about get comfy in the back of the MG3, though like all of its alternatives there really isn’t space for three except for very short journeys. There’s more legroom and headroom than in a Toyota Yaris, and it’s about on par with the Renault Clio - but a Honda Jazz is the king for back seat space. Rear passengers get a pair of air vents and small door bins, but they have to share one charging port and there's no fold-down armrest for a bit of extra comfort. The rear windows are nice and big, though, so there’s a good view out. ISOFIX points are present in both outer rear seats Boot space With 293 litres of boot space, the MG3 is on the lower end of average here. It has more room than the Toyota Yaris with its 286-litre boot, and just a snip less than the 300 litres of the Renault Clio hybrid. If you want a bigger boot, look to non-hybrid Clios which have 391 litres. What’s more disappointing is that the MG’s seatbacks don’t split-fold - it just flops down as one unit. That means if you want to extend the boot to carry larger items, you can’t have any rear occupants at all. Even the Dacia Sandero has split-folding rear seats, so this is pretty poor from MG and limits the car’s versatility. When the seats are folded, you do have a reasonable space, though there is a big load lip and the floor isn’t left totally flat. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories A huge upgrade over the last MG3, but does feel cheap in places The new MG3’s interior is similar to the MG4 EV’s , which means it’s pretty minimalist and feels quite well-built. It’s much more stylish than the last MG3 - you get some nice touches like a cute tartan-patterned plastic section as well as some fake leather padding. It’s much more high-tech too, with almost everything controlled by the 10.3-inch touchscreen infotainment system in the centre. This is similar to the one on the MG4, but feels a little easier to use in places. However, it’s still dominated by menus with tiny, difficult-to-press buttons which makes life annoying if you’re trying to alter functions on the move. It’s best, then, to ensure you’ve made most of your corrections before you set off. In particular, you’ll probably want to adjust the safety and assisted driving functions - they’re pretty irritating. There are some hotkeys below the screen, including one to get you directly to the climate control menu - though annoyingly this doesn’t work if you’re using the Apple CarPlay or Android Auto smartphone connectivity. Both of those work well, incidentally, though it’s a shame they don’t connect wirelessly. The driver display is big and clear, but a little busy. Some functions like the cruise control info are constantly visible, even when you’re not using them, whereas for everything else you need to cycle through a small menu on the right side. You don’t get a rev counter unless you’re on the power display screen - not that you need one in an automatic, but some people do like to have one. Material quality is a mixed bag. We would have liked some more soft-touch plastics on the door cards in particular, as this is where your arm naturally rests, but you can definitely forgive a few cheap-feeling areas - this is a very inexpensive car compared to the alternatives and it doesn’t feel much more downmarket inside than a Toyota Yaris. MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax During a week of mixed motoring with the MG3 we averaged just over 50mpg. That number tends to go up to around 55mpg in town driving and around 48mpg on a long motorway trip. This isn’t bad, but compared to the Renault Clio Hybrid or Toyota Yaris it’s a bit disappointing - both of those cars will average much closer to 60mpg. The MG’s additional power and performance does go some way to justifying the decrease, though - but if you’re buying one to lower your running costs, it’s possible to get better economy out of an even cheaper pure-petrol hatchback like a Dacia Sandero. CO2 emissions are good, though, at just 100g/km - only a few g/km more than a Clio or a Yaris. That puts it just one bracket above them in terms of company car tax, and the same band for first-year road tax. Safety and security Safety and security The MG3 hasn’t yet been tested by Euro NCAP . The old model scored just three stars when it was tested way back in 2014, but the new car has almost no relationship to it and therefore shouldn’t be compared. Instead, it’d make more sense to compare the 3 to MG’s more recent models - the MG4, MG HS and MG ZS EV all scored the full five-stars, admittedly quite a few years ago for the latter two. Safety equipment includes the usual - autonomous emergency braking, lane-keep assist and various speed limit aids. You can turn most of these off easily enough, but if you forget you’ll soon be reminded by a set of intensely irritating bongs - some of the worst we’ve heard. We also found the lane-keeping to be a bit hyperactive, alerting us when we were nowhere near the white lines. The adaptive cruise control and assisted driving functions work well, though. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems It’s far too early to tell if the MG3 will be a reliable choice or not. MG typically returns a mid-table ranking in reliability surveys, though the cars themselves don’t usually suffer much with mechanical maladies. MG’s seven-year, 80,000-mile warranty should give peace of mind here - it’s better than the three years of coverage you get on a Renault Clio, though the Toyota ‘Relax’ warranty with up to ten years of coverage makes the Yaris an even more compelling proposition."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/mg/gs,MG GS Review and Prices,"€21,561",5/10,new,"The MG GS is a medium-sized family SUV that’s a little larger than the likes of the Nissan Qashqai and Renault Kadjar, yet costs a little less. Unfortunately, some of the MG’s penny-pinching is all too obvious, such as the brittle interior plastics and second-rate infotainment system. From the outside, the MG GS looks more like a jacked-up hatchback than most family SUVs. It sports all the black plastic bumper trims you’d expect of a chunky pseudo-off-roader, but the MG GS’ curvy bumpers, slim brake lights and raked roofline look sportier than the comparatively boxy Kia Sportage and Hyundai Tucson. Unfortunately, the MG GS’ interesting exterior only serves to show how dull and drab its interior is. It’s neatly laid out and all the buttons are grouped together so they’re easy to reach, but almost every surface comes with a hard plastic finish and the optional brushed-metal effect trims don’t feel anywhere near as robust as they look. You can have contrasting inserts fitted to the dashboard and doors, but these do little to spruce up the GS’ interior. Equally middling is the touchscreen infotainment system. It’s easy to read but nowhere near as intuitive as the systems you get in most alternatives. What it loses out in technology, the GS claws back (albeit only slightly) in terms of practicality. There’s just as much room in the front seats as you get in the likes of the Nissan Qashqai and there’s more space for carrying three adults at once in the back. The MG GS might appeal if you’re looking for something practical and likely to stand out, but it isn’t particularly good to drive and doesn’t feel as well built as most other family SUVs. It’s a similar story when you need to load the MG GS’ boot. It’s bigger than the Nissan’s and there’s no load lip which makes it easy to slide in heavy boxes. You can fold the back seats down if you need to carry seriously bulky stuff, such as a bike. It’s a shame you can’t get the MG GS with a diesel engine to help you carry very heavy luggage or tow a trailer, though. Instead, it comes with a 1.5-litre 166hp petrol unit. At least it feels fairly spritely and trundles along at motorway speeds relatively quietly – if not particularly economically. Head off the motorway and you’ll find the MG GS doesn’t feel particularly relaxing to drive. Its suspension is firmer than in the likes of the Nissan Qashqai so you’ll feel more of a thud each time you hit a pothole around town. At least you get a decent view out and the optional automatic gearbox you can get in top-spec models means you don’t have to make endless gear changes in heavy traffic. Unlike most SUVs, you can’t get the GS with automatic emergency braking, lane-keeping assistance or driver tiredness detection. As a result, you’ll be better off looking elsewhere if safety is your number one priority. But, if you’re after a sporty-looking yet practical SUV on a shoestring budget, it could be worth a look. Check out our MG GS deals to see how much you can save on one."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/mg/zs,MG ZS Review & Prices,"€26,319",7/10,new,"Is the MG ZS a good car? Is the MG ZS a good car? The previous-generation MG ZS was a small SUV that you’d buy because it was cheap - and then spend the rest of your time apologising for it. It was unattractive, thirsty, poor to drive and had a really cheap-feeling interior. However, the second-generation model has had a true Cinderella-style glow-up, and should push the old car right to the back of everybody’s minds - it’s a huge improvement in every way. Based on the same mechanical underpinnings as the excellent MG3 hatchback, the new ZS gets an up-to-date hybrid engine, techy interior and a smart - if not stunning - new look. It’s like trading in your old Nokia for a new smartphone. Probably not the latest Apple iPhone, as MG is still firmly a budget brand - more like one of those off-brand Android phones that gives you lots and lots of bang for your buck. As a small hybrid SUV , there are alternatives to the MG ZS coming from every corner. Some of the best include the Renault Captur , the Hyundai Kona Hybrid , the Peugeot 2008 or the Carwow award-winning Toyota Yaris Cross . MG does things a bit differently to those cars, though. First of all, there’s the way the hybrid system works. It’s far more powerful than any of those alternatives - with 191hp beating out 140hp in the Captur or a measly 115hp in the Yaris Cross. MG’s done this by fitting a more powerful electric motor and a bigger battery, which means that most of the time it drives like an electric car with a petrol generator. However, if you put your foot down both power sources will give their all, making this quite a rapid little SUV. The comparison is also pretty favourable when it comes to interior space. The ZS has enough room for a six-foot adult to sit behind a driver of the same size in comfort, which means it’s also great for child seats or lanky teenagers. The 443-litre boot is also bigger than the hybrid Renault Captur or the Toyota Yaris Cross, and only marginally smaller than the Hyundai Kona hybrid. It’s in the cabin where you notice evidence of MG’s cost-cutting, though - there are plenty of low-rent material choices, and infotainment software that despite being a huge improvement on the old ZS isn’t as easy to use or as intuitive as the best systems out there. You do get loads of equipment, though. The top-spec Trophy model is still inexpensive but comes with climate control, sat-nav, smartphone connectivity, leather upholstery and a full suite of driver assistance tech including the semi-autonomous MG Pilot system. To drive, it’s another huge leap from the old car, which was pretty dire on the road. The ZS isn’t as satisfying to drive as a Renault Captur or Toyota Yaris Cross, despite its superior power output - but it has light controls and good visibility, making it great around town. Only poor refinement on the motorway and quite crashy suspension let the side down. If lots of power and equipment for a low price capture your imagination, check out our best MG ZS deals right here. You can find a used MG ZS for sale here, or search other used MGs for sale . And remember that Carwow can even help you sell your old car when the time comes. How much is the MG ZS? How much is the MG ZS? The new ZS starts from just under £22,000, which seems a big jump from the old car until you take into account the hybrid engine and ample standard equipment. Compared with a top-spec, automatic variant of the old car, it’s not a big increase, and the two are pretty comparable. It’s also cheaper - both in terms of cash price and monthly payments on a PCP - than a Renault Captur hybrid, Toyota Yaris Cross or Hyundai Kona. If you want to pay less for a compact SUV , you’ll have to look to things like the Dacia Duster or nearly-discontinued Citroen C3 Aircross . Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort Lots of power, but firm suspension means it’s a bit lumpy over bumps - and refinement is an issue The MG ZS uses the same hybrid system as the MG3. It pairs a 1.5-litre petrol engine with around 102hp to a powerful, 136hp electric motor. It also uses a 1.84kWh battery - more than double the size of most alternatives. The result of this system is that, around town, the ZS mostly uses its electric motor, with the petrol engine kicking in as a generator rather than driving the wheels. This means it’s easy to make smooth progress, as you’re basically driving an electric car. Don’t expect the silent progress of an electric car, though, as the engine comes in and out as needed, and has quite a coarse edge to the sound and often seems to rev higher than you might expect. It’s not obtrusive, but it’s moreso than the petrol engine of a Toyota Yaris Cross. The ZS has good visibility out of the front, and you sit quite high up. The suspension is quite firm, which means you feel more of the road’s bumps and lumps than you do in a Renault Captur - even when the latter’s on its largest alloy wheels. With so much power at your disposal compared to a Renault Captur or Toyota Yaris Cross, the MG ZS feels like it gets up to speed with much less effort and that there’s more in reserve when you need overtake. However, it’s not quite as smooth under heavy acceleration - the gearbox only has three ratios, which means there are quite large gaps between them, and if you’re putting your foot down the power surges quite disconcertingly. If you drive more normally, it’s not quite so big an issue, and the alternatives are guilty of similar things - like the Yaris Cross and its CVT which often holds the revs very high for long periods. The ZS’s suspension still feels firm on the motorway, and you can definitely notice things like expansion joints on bridges. But it’s not quite as irritating as it is around town. What’s more annoying is that the ZS has quite a lot of wind and road noise at speed, where alternatives are much more refined. Every ZS gets MG Pilot as standard, which is a full suite of assisted driving options including adaptive cruise control and lane-keeping aids. It works quite well, though even the closest following distance is very generous. The ZS has light steering that doesn’t give you very much feedback, and so it’s not particularly satisfying to drive quickly. There’s plenty of grip and you never feel like it’s incapable of taking corners fast, but there’s no pleasure to be had in doing so - a Renault Captur or Yaris Cross are both better to drive on a twisty road. The powertrain does have a Sport mode, which makes it feel even more eager but adds unnatural-feeling weight to the steering. We’d leave it in Normal mode most of the time, especially given the driving mode switch is positioned quite far back on the centre console and not the easiest to press without looking. Space and practicality Space and practicality Not particularly clever, but lots of space in the boot and back seats Up front the MG ZS is a mixed bag. The glovebox is a good size, as are the door bins, and there’s a decent cubby under the central armrest too. However, the cupholders are tiny. There’s a tray ahead of the gearlever which looks like it should have a wireless charging pad - more on that later - and another one to the side which is a little useless because it doesn’t have raised edges and the surface isn’t very grippy, so items you put on there are liable to slide off. There’s a reasonable level of adjustment in the seat, including lumbar support for the first time on an MG. It’s quite narrow, though, so larger people may find themselves sat on the seat bolsters rather than between them. There’s also currently no reach adjustment for the steering wheel - MG assures us that this issue only affects very early-build cars and will soon be rectified, but worth checking that you can actually get comfortable before buying. There is a USB-A and a USB-C port up front, though annoyingly the latter is only for charging devices and you have to use the older standard to connect your phone. Considering it’s a small SUV the MG ZS has loads of room in the back seats. There’s space for a six-foot rear passenger to stretch out behind a driver of a similar size, and there’s even room under the front seats to slide your feet. It’s not the widest cabin, so it won’t be the best or three, but two adults should be able to get very comfy. It’s a shame there’s no fold-down centre armrest, though you do get air vents and a USB-A port in the middle console. There are ISOFIX points for mounting a child seat on the outer two rear seats, and there’s enough space and the doors open wide enough to make fitting even a bulky rear-facing car seat quite easy. With 443 litres of space, the ZS has more room in the boot than a Toyota Yaris Cross (397 litres). The Renault Captur has more space with its rear seats slid forward, but with them in the rearmost position it has only 348 litres on offer. The ZS gets a movable boot floor, so you can choose between maximum volume and a flat loading floor. Fold the rear seatbacks and you do get loads of space as well as an almost totally unobstructed load bay - good for trips to the flat-pack furniture store. It’s a little short on clever features, though - underfloor storage is limited, bag hooks are pretty puny, and there’s nowhere to store the large, rigid parcel shelf. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories Not the most stylish interior, but it seems well built and the touchscreen is MG’s best yet MG’s latest cars - the MG3, HS and ZS - all have a fairly cohesive exterior design, but you can’t say the same about the interior. Though the switchgear is shared, the ZS has a totally different interior design to MGs other cars, and that brings some positives and negatives. It’s more traditional than the MG3, with a 7.0-inch digital instrument cluster in a recessed portion of the dash rather than a pod on the steering column. The infotainment screen is integrated into the dashboard too, and it sits lower than it does on other MG models - making it a bit easier to interact with. That screen is 12.3-inches across, and it runs an updated version of MG’s interface. So while it’s similar to the screens on the 3, 4 and HS, it’s quite a lot more responsive and the controls have been made larger and easier to hit. That’s great news, as the fiddly interface of the infotainment systems was a key complaint of these other models. It’s still not as easy to use as the Android-based infotainment system of a Renault Captur, but compared to the screen in a Yaris Cross it’s actually a little better. There’s a row of shortcut keys under the screen which give quick access to a few functions, but we’d love to see a couple more given dedicated climate controls. It’s also a shame that, while Apple CarPlay and Android Auto functionality is included, it’s wired-only - most new models have wireless integration. There’s also no wireless charger, though you probably won’t need it much if you’re using the smartphone integration as plugging in will keep your phone topped up. But it’s a pity that it’s not even an option. Quality is a mixed bag. The ZS feels relatively solidly built, though not as good as the bank-vault quality of a Yaris Cross. But lots of the materials are much cheaper than they appear, such as tinny-feeling fake chrome and scratchy plastic atop the door cards. MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax Officially, the ZS will return 55.4mpg and emits 115g/km of CO2. That’s a little down on the Yaris Cross and the Captur, both of which claim over 60mpg - and driven carefully, can in fact deliver it. In the real world we got 48mpg out of the ZS over about 100 mixed miles, not driving very carefully - with a lighter foot over 50mpg would be possible. So it’s not as efficient as its main alternatives, but that’s to be expected given it’s so much more powerful than they are. Its emissions put it two BIK bands higher than the Yaris Cross or Captur for company car tax, but they’re still appreciably lower than any of the purely petrol-powered competition. Safety and security Safety and security The new MG ZS scored four stars when tested by Euro NCAP. That's an improvement on the old ZS, which scored just three stars way back in 2017 on a much less stringent test. For a budget model, four stars isn't bad, and its 75% and 82% ratings for adult and child occupant safety are reassuring. Safety equipment is all present and correct including the obligatory speed warnings and driver monitoring tech, all of which is quite easy to turn off through the menus should you want to - though it’s a shame there isn’t a way to map these functions to one of the steering wheel shortcut buttons. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems MG came a flat last in the 2024 Driver Power owner satisfaction survey , with motorists rating it poorly for reliability. MG is much more optimistic that its latest cars will be more reliable than those which came before them, though, and has invested heavily in its dealer network as well as parts supply to hopefully improve the speed and service when it comes to fixing problems which might arise. At least you shouldn’t be put out of pocket for issues with the ZS - MG covers all of its cars with a 7-year, 80,000 mile warranty, which is one of the longest around. MG ZS FAQs MG ZS FAQs"
https://www.carwow.co.uk/mg/zs/2018,MG ZS Review & Prices,"€24,965",5/10,new,"Is the MG ZS a good car? Is the MG ZS a good car? If you’re looking for a small family SUV that’s practical, affordable and reasonably well-equipped, the MG ZS is well worth considering. Okay, it might not feel quite as upmarket as the likes of the Mazda CX-3 but it’s significantly cheaper to buy and much roomier inside. The standard fabric seats come with enough adjustment to get comfortable and the buttons you’ll regularly use are easy to reach and laid out in a logical, uncluttered fashion. Both the Excite and Exclusive trims come with a 10.1-inch colour touchscreen as standard for the infotainment system. You get Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and the Exclusive also has integrated sat nav. The MG’s system is easy to use and responds quickly to your finger on the screen, but some of the menus can be tricky to go back a page, so it’s not quite as intuitive to use as that in a Ford Puma . The back seats don’t get so many nice touches. Although you’ll find there’s much more headroom and legroom than in a Renault Captur , Mazda CX-3 or Nissan Juke , there are no cupholders or centre rear armrest. The 448-litre boot’s roomy too – it’s more than 90 litres larger than the Mazda (350 litres), and 26 litres more than both the Renault or Nissan (422 litres). It's more than big enough to carry a large baby buggy and some big soft bags at once. Flip the back seats down and there’s just enough space to carry a bike with its wheels attached. You can get the ZS with two petrol engines. Pick the 1.0-litre turbo petrol if you spend lots of time driving around town or the 1.5-litre petrol model if you do lots of motorway miles. Both are relatively quiet – if not particularly quick – and will return around 35mpg in normal conditions compared to MG’s claimed 44.9mpg and 49.6mpg respectively. There's also the MG ZS EV - one of the most affordable electric SUVs on sale - that we've reviewed separately. Here we're focused purely on the petrol model. Whichever engine you pick, the ZS is easy to drive thanks to its adjustable steering that provides extra assistance at slow speeds. Unfortunately, the view out the back isn’t great, which can make squeezing into tight parking spaces a bit tricky – but at least rear parking sensors as standard. You even get cruise control on all models to help make long drives a bit more relaxing. Unfortunately, the ZS is quite noisy at motorway speeds and you’ll hear quite a bit more wind and tyre noise than in the likes of the Mazda, and it isn’t as comfortable over bumpy roads as the Citroen C3 Aircross. Unlike these alternatives, the MG doesn’t come with the option of automatic emergency braking to help stop the car quickly if it senses an obstacle ahead. As a result, it has only managed a three-start score from Euro NCAP . If this isn’t a dealbreaker for you, the MG ZS makes a strong case for itself as an affordable, yet spacious, small family car. Avoid the rather spartan entry-level models and it’s an SUV that’s well worth considering.

MG has kept the steps between the trim levels, two engine choices and pair of gearboxes on offer very simple. With the Excite, you can have either engine but to jump from the 1.5- to the pricier and more powerful 1.0-litre motor costs £2500 as this also adds the automatic gearbox. In the Exclusive trim, going from 1.5- to 1.0-litre engine adds £1250 to the bill for a manual, and the same again if you want the auto ’box. ZS prices compare very keenly with others in the class like the Nissan Qashqai or Skoda Karoq , with the MG undercutting them by thousands rather than mere hundreds of pounds. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort Plenty of peppy performance for the MG ZS from its turbocharged 1.0-litre petrol engine, but the driving experience is below par for the class The MG ZS delivers the raised driving position that makes this type of car ideal in town traffic. You get a good view to the front and sides of the MG, but the view over the driver’s shoulder is hampered by the sweep of the window line and thick rear pillars. Countering this are standard reversing sensors on both trim levels. The Exclusive also comes with blind spot monitoring and rear cross traffic alert to make life simple driving on multi-lane roads or when backing out of a space. A comfy and easily adjusted driving position makes a good case for the ZS, and the Exclusive has heated front seats and electric adjustment. There’s lots of room for the driver’s head, legs, elbows and shoulders, while the gear lever in manual cars is an easy reach. You’ll also find the pedals are weighted to be light on the feet for use in the city. For those who prefer an automatic gearbox to take the stress out of town driving, the MG’s is decent enough in town, but struggles for smooth shifts on faster roads. The 1.0-litre turbo petrol engine is no quicker than the larger capacity 1.5-litre petrol, but the smaller unit feels livelier and is more refined, so it’s the one to have. It’s just a shame you can only have it with the auto ’box in the Excite trim, which adds to the overall price of the car. If the MG ZS is decent around town, it comes a bit unstuck on the motorway. The ride that deals well enough with urban potholes becomes choppy and unsettled at faster speeds, whereas a Dacia Duster is much more compliant over bumps. On the motorway, there’s also a lot of road noise that makes its way into the cabin of the ZS, so it can be a loud place to spend a journey if you’re on a coarse grain of road surface. The engines both pull well up to the national speed limit and cruise happily, helped by standard cruise control with speed limiter in both trims. However, neither engine is particularly hushed and definitely not as quiet as you'll find in a Nissan Qashqai or Skoda Karoq. Take the MG ZS on to a country road and it feels much more in its element than on the motorway. There’s a good amount of grip from the front-wheel drive set-up into and through corners, so you can press on more than in a Dacia Duster. Steering feel in the MG is also a highlight of its driving manners, offering plenty of feedback and just the right amount of weight as you turn it. The MG isn’t as agile or as much fun as a Ford Puma, but it acquits itself well enough in this area to be worth considering for anyone who lives out in the sticks. Space and practicality Space and practicality Comfort and space are both excellent in the MG ZS, though the rear seats and boot are not as versatile as some You’ll find it easy to get comfortable behind the wheel of the MG ZS as all models come with driver’s seat height adjustment. The steering wheel also moves for height and depth, while the seat slides back and forth a long way to accommodate drivers of all heights. Should you opt for the higher Exclusive trim, you also get heated man-made leather front seats with electric movement. The view out of the MG to the front and sides is unhindered, but you will find vision over your left shoulder not so good due to the thick rear screen pillars and the way the window line sweeps up. Still, all ZS models come with rear parking sensors as standard, and the Exclusive adds rear cross traffic alert to warn you of vehicles approaching from the side as you reverse. In most ZS models, you get a proper handbrake lever, but 1.0-litre cars with the automatic transmission come with an electronic parking brake instead. Next to the normal handbrake, you’ll find a pair of cupholders moulded into the transmission tunnel. That’s about your lot for storage in this area of the car as the space in front of the gear stick is small, though there are a couple of USB chargers in the dash console. The glovebox is small, but the door bins can cope with a typical water bottle. There might not be any clever tricks to the MG ZS’s back seat, like sliding bases or tilting backs, but you do not go short on space. In fact, the ZS provides the sort of rear seat room you’d normally expect to get in cars that are a size up from this small SUV. The result is it’s easy to lift kids through the rear door entrance into their seats, which are secured with a pair of ISOFIX mounts in the two outer rear chairs. Adults will find loads of leg, head and shoulder room, and the seat offers decent comfort and padding on longer trips. Three triple-point seat belts are included with the ZS and there’s enough breadth in the cabin for a trio of adults to sit for short journeys. On longer adventures, it’s a bit tight and the seat base will pinch on the central passenger’s thighs. Storage comes courtesy of small door bins and a pair of soft pockets in the front seat backs. With 448 litres of luggage capacity in the MG ZS, there's more than enough space to deal with most shopping or holiday needs. That's a few litres bigger than a two-wheel drive Dacia Duster has to offer, but in four-wheel drive form that drops to 411 litres, making the MG ZS more appealing if you don't need the extra 4x4 grip. The Renault Captur has 422 litres of space, but you can push the rear seats forward to increase this to a healthy 536 litres. A height-adjustable boot floor also lets you vary the load bay to a small extent, with the floor in its higher place sitting flush with the load sill. The rear bench is split 60-40 and tips easily enough to free up a maximum of space. However, there is a step in the load floor, so it’s not as easy to slide in longer loads than in, for instance, a Ford Puma. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories The MG’s cabin and build quality give no hint of the car’s budget prices, though the infotainment isn’t the slickest If the keen price of the MG ZS range makes you suspect corners will have been cut inside the cabin, think again. There is no hint of the car’s affordable prices on show, even when you let your hands wander to the plastics lower on the doors and dash where sharp edges and hard plastics often lurk. There are some scratchy plastics in the MG, but the ZS does a good job of using them where your hands tend not to go very often. Even the centre console’s cupholders that are moulded into the plastic still feel quite substantial and strong. In the Excite trim, the only thing to really give the game away that it’s the lower of the two trims are the standard analogue main dials. They use a simple white-on-black design that’s easy to read even in bright sunshine, plus there’s a digital information display in the middle. The Exclusive upgrades to a fully digital main dash display that can be configured in a number of ways to suit your preferences for style and how the data is presented – all very mid-level management meeting! In front of this, the thick-rimmed steering wheel gives a pleasingly sporty feel to remind you this is an MG, while buttons on the wheel work the stereo and cruise control . A few small buttons on the centre console take care of some of the heating controls, but almost every function is worked through the 10.1-inch infotainment screen. For some, this will be a techy delight, while others will rue not having physical buttons for the heating and stereo operation. At least with this infotainment set-up, MG has banished the previous smaller screen and gives us big on-screen icons. It’s simple to scroll through the menus, though trying to go back a page can be harder than it should be if you want to change your mind about something. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto take care of hooking up your phone to the infotainment, but there’s no option of wireless charging for your device. You’ll have to make do with plugging in a cable to one of the USB charge points. The Excite comes with four speakers for the stereo, while the Exclusive has six speakers and 3D sound. With the higher trim model, you also get a 360-degree parking camera on the infotainment screen, as well as integrated sat nav. MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax Given there are two engines and two gearboxes to pick from in the MG ZS, you’d reckon on a bit of variation for the fuel economy and emissions figures. Not so with this MG. Instead, it comes with the same official combined economy number regardless of which trim, engine, or gearbox you choose. That number is 42.7mpg, which is some way behind the best a Nissan Qashqai or Skoda Karoq can offer. It’s the same story with carbon dioxide emissions, where the MG ZS emits a low of 149g/km. Again, that trails the class leaders in this sector. These figures also mean the MG falls into the £230 first-year bracket for road tax with the lowest emitting versions, but some others stumble into the much more expensive £585 category. At current company car tax rates, that means the MG ZS business driver will pay car tax at anywhere between a steep 34-37%. Safety and security Safety and security The MG ZS has scored only a poor three-star result in Euro NCAP tests. It does well enough for adult occupant safety, recording a 71% score, but child safety is down at 51%. What really holds the MG back from a better Euro NCAP result is its limited amount of safety assistance technology. It doesn’t have automatic emergency braking, or lane departure warning or lane keeping. Many of the others in this sector come with this tech included. However, the MG does have six airbags, and the Exclusive version has blind spot monitoring and rear cross traffic alert as standard. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems The car scores well with owners for satisfaction and reliability is cited as one of the main reasons for this. MG provides a seven-year/80,000-mile warranty with every one of its cars, which is among the best cover for new cars in the UK. There have been no recalls issued for the MG ZS, so there’s nothing to worry about on that front."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/mg/hs,MG HS Review & Prices,"€35,387",8/10,new,"Is the MG HS a good car? Is the MG HS a good car? The MG HS has at points been the best-selling car in the UK and it’s easy to see why. It’s a big, practical family SUV with a posh-looking interior, loads of standard equipment and a headline-grabbing plug-in hybrid engine option - but it costs about as much as most small hatchbacks . While the old HS was definitely in the ‘cheap but not very cheerful’ category, the new model actually feels like something you wouldn’t mind driving around - it has redeeming features other than its price tag. It’s a bit like a Harvester - nobody’s ever going to look at it as a high-end option, but if you’re looking to feed the whole family on a budget, it’s tasty enough that you don’t feel punished for your penny-pinching. The HS is a similar size to family SUVs such as the Ford Kuga , Kia Sportage and Nissan Qashqai - but with its low price tag, you might consider it on the same shortlist as much smaller SUVs such as the Volkswagen T-Cross or Ford Puma . Two more direct alternatives are the Citroen C5 Aircross or BYD Seal U - both big SUVs that put affordability first, and have plug-in hybrid engines available. If your main concern is space for the money, the MG HS is a great option. Despite a price tag close to something like a Volkswagen Polo hatchback, it has space in the back for a six-foot adult to stretch out, plus a 507-litre boot that’ll accommodate the whole family’s kit and clobber. You also get a dashboard that looks pretty posh, with a dual-screen setup just like you get on a BMW X3 . You don’t have to press very far to find out where MG’s saved money, though, and materials and build quality aren’t really up to the standards of more expensive cars. It’s also not the easiest to use, with very few physical switches, an awkward touchscreen interface and not much storage for smaller items. As far as engines go, there’s a choice of two. You can have a bog-standard petrol, available with manual or automatic gearboxes - these are the more affordable options, and though they’re not particularly offensive to drive they are a bit thirsty. The headline-grabber is the HS plug-in hybrid, which can do up to 75 miles on a charge. That figure is up there with the best PHEVs on sale, and it gives you tons of flexibility - it’s enough to do even the longest of commutes without troubling the petrol engine once. It also nudges the HS into the lowest-but-one band for Benefit-in-Kind tax, making it hundreds of pounds a month cheaper than the equivalent Kia Sportage or Ford Kuga for company car drivers. Both of those cars are better to drive, mind you - they steer more sweetly and handle bumps better, as well as being more responsive and reassuring in the corners. The gap is narrower if you’re just cruising round town or on the motorway, though, where the HS is impressively refined and difficult to dislike. If the new MG HS seems like the SUV for you, check out our best MG HS deals on Carwow. You can see our other MG deals here, or search for a used MG for sale here. And remember, Carwow can even help you sell your old car . How much is the MG HS? How much is the MG HS? The MG HS starts from just a few hundred pounds more than a Citroen C5 Aircross - though it gets a long list of standard equipment making it very good value on paper. That makes it a significant amount less than any other SUV of this size, though - the Kia Sportage, Ford Kuga and Toyota RAV4 all seem very pricey by comparison. The pricing is simple to understand, too. It’s a £1,500 jump if you’d like an automatic gearbox, and a £2,500 jump to go from basic SE trim to the range-topping Trophy. The HS PHEV, meanwhile, does the same trick of being far cheaper than alternatives - it even undercuts the Citroen C5 Aircross PHEV by almost £4,000. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort A decent engine and impressive plug-in hybrid - but the HS doesn’t handle corners or ride bumps as well as the best family cars The HS has pretty soft suspension, so it can handle bigger bumps without too much thudding - at the expense of feeling a little uncontrolled. Hit a speed bump too fast and you’ll feel the car bouncing a little. The steering is quite heavy right off the centre before becoming very light, which is a little disconcerting but doesn’t take too long to get used to. Visibility isn’t amazing - the windscreen pillars are quite thick, and you can’t easily see the front corners of the bonnet. There’s also a big blind spot over your shoulder thanks to very chunky C-pillars. However, all models get a reversing camera and the Trophy spec comes with a really useful 360-degree monitor which can even give a ‘transparent chassis’ effect - using the camera feeds to show you what’s underneath the car as well as around it. The plug-in hybrid is the best engine to choose for town driving. With up to 75 miles of pure electric range - and plenty of power from the electric motor - it truly feels like driving a regular electric SUV, making it very smooth and pleasant. The automatic petrol, by contrast, is a bit jerky, while the manual has a light action albeit with a slightly rubbery shift. Both the regular petrol and the plug-in hybrid HS are impressively refined on the motorway, with very little engine noise allowed to penetrate the cabin. Wind and road noise is quite well-contained as well, making the HS much quieter than many budget SUVs. There’s ample power from either engine, but the petrol’s 169hp does rather trail the 371hp on offer from the plug-in hybrid. The former feels adequate to haul this large family SUV up to speed, but it does need working quite hard on a sliproad or to execute decisive overtakes. The PHEV, meanwhile, has loads of power in reserve - with more than 200hp from the electric motor alone, even when it’s running as a pure EV it feels impressively peppy right up to the legal limit. The HS’s soft suspension irons out bumps on faster roads well, but like at lower speeds it has a tendency to bounce around if it hits a sharper pothole or crevice. MG’s full suite of driver assistance aids come with the HS, and the adaptive cruise control is a pretty good system - it works well and the alerts aren’t too annoying. More on the rest of the car’s safety assists later, however… The HS isn’t much fun to drive on a twisty road. You can go for the manual gearbox for maximum driver involvement, or the PHEV for the most power - but both have dead, lifeless steering that doesn’t communicate what the front wheels are doing, and limited grip that leads to the car washing wide in fast corners. The body can lean quite a bit in bends, too, so for the sake of your family in the back it’s probably better to take it easy on a twisting road. A Ford Kuga is much more fun to fling about in the corners. Space and practicality Space and practicality Lots of space in the back, but limited storage for small items and alternatives have bigger boots Front-seat occupants in the MG HS are quite well-treated. The seats get electric adjustment and are wide and reasonably supportive. It’s a shame that they don’t adjust for tilt, though, as long-legged drivers will feel like they need a bit more under-thigh support. There are a pair of cupholders ahead of the gear lever and a wireless phone charger ahead of it, plus a small space under the armrest. The glovebox is a reasonable size, as are the door bins - the only thing that’s really missing is a quick place to stash keys or wallets that isn’t out of sight. It’s also a shame that, while there are two USB ports, they’re USB-A and not the more modern and universal USB-C that more and more cars are including. A six-foot passenger can sit behind a six-foot driver with room to spare, so it’s fair to say that rear seat space in the MG HS is easily on par with a Citroen C5 Aircross or Kia Sportage in this regard. The centre seat is quite narrow, but the bench is pretty flat so it doesn’t feel like you’re uncomfortably perched way up. Rear passengers get a totally flat floor with plenty of foot room, large rear windows for a good view out and a fold-down centre armrest with a couple of cupholders. There are also door bins which can accommodate a bottle of water, plus a couple of USB-A ports in the centre for keeping gadgets charged. With a 507-litre boot, the new HS has addressed one of the issues of its predecessor - and impressively, despite the large battery, the plug-in hybrid doesn’t lose any boot space. That means that while the petrol’s boot is smaller than a Citroen C5 Aircross (580 litres) or Ford Kuga (526 litres), the PHEV’s is actually bigger than the equivalent version of either of those cars, which only get 460 and 475 litres of space respectively. It’s roomy, but not very clever - you don’t get any bag hooks or tie-down points, and while the seats do fold down totally flat you have to walk around or reach through to do so. There’s a small space under the floor which can accommodate a few bits and pieces, such as the hybrid’s charging cable. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories The most luxurious MG interior yet, but software still leaves a little to be desired The HS’s dashboard looks like a million dollars compared with the old car’s - it’s modern and uses some pretty high-quality materials in places. The dash is dominated by two 12.3-inch screens, one for driver information and the other for infotainment, while other physical controls are limited to those around the steering wheel and a row of shortcut switches underneath the central display. You don’t have to prod around for long to find cheap materials - the door cards, glovebox lid and lower part of the centre console all feel hard and scratchy, but that’s to be expected in a car as cheap as this. The infotainment software is the same as you’ll find in the MG3 and MG4, which is to say it’s not bad but could be improved. There are too many fiddly menus to contend with, some of which don’t feel like they’re well optimised for a touchscreen. While there are physical shortcut buttons to demist the front and rear windscreens, plus one to turn the climate control on and off altogether, we’d prefer if these took you to the car’s various menus instead as they don’t really save you too many button presses. The driver display isn’t as good as alternatives, either. While it can display a full-screen map - which is nice - you can’t get a proper analogue rev counter, which can be annoying in manual models. There’s quite a lot of wasted space, too, with tiny readouts surrounded by big swathes of nothing. MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax Starting with the regular petrol HS - we achieved around 44mpg on a mixed road route, which is pretty good for a car of this size. Expect that to dip to less than 40mpg if you’re just driving through town, but prolonged motorway use might see it creep up a little further. CO2 emissions of 168g/km for the manual and 173g/km for the automatic mean you’re unlikely to recommend this as a company car, however, as tax bills will be quite high. The PHEV, however, has the potential for extremely low running costs indeed. Official tests peg the fuel consumption at a remarkable 672.6mpg, a product of its huge 75-mile electric range. That’s among the highest range of any PHEV on sale, beaten only by the Mercedes GLC 300e and Range Rover Sport P460e - both of which cost far, far more than the HS. This is thanks to a battery that’s actually bigger than the one you got in a first-generation Nissan Leaf - an impressive showcase of how far PHEVs have come. It endows the HS with official CO2 figures of just 12g/km - punting it into the 5% band for company car tax. This means it’ll be a good couple of hundred pounds per month cheaper as a company car than the equivalent Sportage or Kuga PHEV. Fuel economy obviously depends on how you drive it, but 75 miles of EV-only range is enough to encompass the overwhelming majority of journeys without ever having to use the petrol engine. And with impressive performance from the electric motor, you won’t feel the need to call on the engine just so you can keep up with traffic, either. When we get a chance to test the HS PHEV on a longer route we’ll tell you how efficient it is (or isn’t) with a discharged battery. One slight shame is that you can’t fast-charge the HS, like you can with some other large-capacity PHEVs. At a maximum rate of 7kW from a wallbox charger, it’ll take more than four hours to charge - not a problem if you’re topping up overnight, but it means you can’t really take advantage of public charge points to replenish your batteries on a long run. Safety and security Safety and security The MG HS - like the previous score - holds a full five-star safety rating from Euro NCAP . A particularly impressive rating of 90% for adult occupant protection is great to see, as is 85% for child occupants, and should quash outdated notions about MG models being behind the back in terms of safety. The usual roster of safety equipment is all standard - autonomous emergency braking, speed limit assist, lane-keeping aids and more. Some of these systems work better than others, though. We found the lane-keeping to be unobtrusive and we were happy to keep it on, however the driver attention warning was so annoying that it actually reduced the attention we paid to the road as we frantically tried to shut it up by turning it off. With all these systems in slightly fiddly menus within the touchscreen there’s actually more risk you might hit something while trying to get rid of them. Best to do this before you set off, then - but we wish MG would fit a shortcut button, like some manufacturers have started doing. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems MG has enough faith in its cars to offer a seven-year, 80,000-mile warranty with all of them. However, the brand performs poorly in the Driver Power owner satisfaction survey, with more than a third of MG owners reporting a problem with their vehicle. It’s too early to make a definitive call on MG HS reliability, though. The engines used in this model are all-new - which can be a good or bad thing, either remedying the problems of older engines or introducing a whole host of new ones. Time will tell.

https://www.carwow.co.uk/mg/s5-ev,MG S5 EV Review & Prices,"€36,264",8/10,new,"Is the MG S5 EV a good car? Is the MG S5 EV a good car? The MG S5 is the sequel to the MG ZS EV - it’s a compact, all-electric SUV , and like the rest of MG’s range majors on value-for-money - putting it right in the firing line of really excellent electric cars such as the Volvo EX30 , Kia EV3 and Skoda Elroq . It’s also the first MG we’ve reviewed that doesn’t really have any caveats - no ‘it’s great for this, but…’ modifiers need to be added. While that does mean it’s not quite as standout as MG’s other cars, like the cheap-as-chips MG 4 or the BIK champion MG HS , it also means that it’s easier to recommend for more people. It’s like a chef who starts their career out with wild and divisive combinations like salmon teacakes with a candyfloss mousse, but matures into making a really solid sea bass with risotto. Like some of the most reliable dishes, the new S5 EV doesn’t exactly shout about its prowess. The styling is the first thing to get past - or the lack of styling, you could say. The S5 EV looks as though MG’s design team started with a normal SUV and then Photoshopped out any of its distinguishing features. While this definitely means it blends into the crowd, you’ll have to be a really magnolia kind of person to be excited by its featureless front end or lower grille ‘inspired’ by the Cyberster sports car. Range: 211 - 298 miles Efficiency: 4.3 - 4.7 mi/kWh Battery size: 49kWh/64kWh Max charge speed: 120kW/139kW Charge time AC: 7hrs / 9hrs 15m @ 7kW Charge time DC: 24min / 28min 10-80% Charge port location: Left rear Power outputs: 170hp / 228hp Things start to look up when you get inside, though. The S5 EV has MG’s best interior to date. Just about everything you touch is covered in soft-touch material, and you really have to look quite hard to find any cheap, nasty plastics - that’s not something you could say about the MG 4, which shares its underpinnings with the S5 EV. Better yet, MG’s listened to feedback from reviewers and journalists, and implemented a few features to make life just that little bit easier. There are physical climate controls underneath the screen so you don’t have to go rootling round in touchscreen menus just to change the temperature, and there’s an easy shortcut to switch off the more annoying driver assistance features too. The S5 EV is great for families as well, as it has bags of rear legroom and a 453-litre boot - nearly matching the roomy Kia EV3. There are two models available - a Standard Range car that can do up to 211 miles on a charge and a Long Range variant which claims up to 298 miles of range. It’s a shame MG has no plans to introduce an Extended Range model, as that could really take the fight to the Kia EV3 which has up to 375 miles of range. So behind the dull looks, the MG S5 EV is really quite a good electric car indeed. If you’re interested, you could check out our best MG S5 EV deals here, or find a great MG S5 leasing offer.

The MG S5 EV may not be the total bargain you’d expect from MG. While a starting price of just under £28,500 is still very reasonable, and cheaper than the Volvo EX30 or Kia EV3, when you move up to the Long Range version there’s more overlap - and so your choice is between a top-spec MG or an entry-level model from a more established and premium brand. At least the S5 EV’s interior now feels posh enough to justify that, and there’s no shortage of equipment either. All versions get a 12.8-inch infotainment screen with wireless smartphone connectivity, full LED lights, a reversing camera and 17-inch alloy wheels. Step up to the Trophy, meanwhile, and an electric tailgate, heated seats and steering wheel, 360-degree camera and 18-inch alloys all come as standard. All versions also get the MG Pilot suite of assisted driving features too, though they do miss out on some nice-to-have features such as a glass roof or head-up display. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort Quite good in the corners and even a little bit fun - but the payoff is that the MG S5 EV is quite firm over bumps in town You’ve no shortage of pep around town, regardless of which MG S5 EV you go for. There’s the usual electric car surge of acceleration, though it’s better controlled in the S5 EV than it was in the old MG ZS EV - you won’t find yourself spinning your wheels out of every junction. Visibility is good, especially over the shoulder thanks to a large rear window and relatively slim rear pillars. And you get parking sensors on all models - plus a 360-degree camera on Trophy cars - to make parking in tight spaces a doddle. There are several levels of regenerative braking available, and though there are no paddles to adjust these you can set the shortcut button on the steering wheel to do just that. There’s also a one-pedal drive mode, but this feels a bit clunky to use. The only real criticism around town is that the S5 EV’s suspension can feel a bit uncultured over bumps - it doesn’t iron out poor road surfaces very well and can feel quite firm and bouncy over bigger obstacles like speed bumps. The MG S5 EV settles down quite nicely at a motorway cruise, and there’s still loads of power in reserve - though it’s not anything like as effortless as a Tesla Model 3 . Long motorway trips will tank the car’s range, but during mixed mileage we saw around 240 miles indicated, which suggests at least a good 200 miles between charging stops on the motorway. The ‘MG Pilot’ suite of safety aids are pretty good - better than a lot of premium manufacturers can manage, in fact. The adaptive cruise control works well and the car’s lane-keeping aids aren’t too irritating - and there’s a quick and easy menu to turn them off, which is an improvement over MG’s other cars. The S5 EV isn’t noisy, but there’s a touch more wind and road noise than you get from a Volvo EX30 or Kia EV3. The S5 EV is rear-wheel drive, which gives you quite a satisfying feeling on a fast, twisting road - the sense that you’re being pushed out of the corners, rather than dragged through them. The steering is nicely weighted and accurate, too. Engage Sport mode and you could even say that the S5 EV is a little bit fun to drive, which isn’t something you can say about many small electric SUVs. Don’t expect a Hyundai Ioniq 5 N in miniature - but if you’re comparing it to the front-driven Kia EV3, or even the rear-wheel drive Cupra Born , the S5 EV is a bit entertaining. At more relaxed speeds, you will still notice that the suspension is a little too firm to be comfortable, though. Space and practicality Space and practicality A large boot and loads of rear seat space, though storage for smaller items isn’t fantastic The front seats in the S5 EV aren’t as supportive as they could be, but they do have plenty of adjustment for drivers of all shapes and sizes - as does the steering wheel. It’s a shame, however, that you have to opt for the Trophy model before you get adjustable lumbar support. In terms of storage, you get a pair of cupholders and a wireless phone charging tray, as well as a long storage cubby under the centre console and one under the armrest. The door bins and glovebox are on the small side, though, and when it comes to smaller items you’ll find yourself missing a tray or cubby to sling things like keys or wallets in. In the rear of the S5 EV, passengers will find plenty of room to stretch out. A six-foot passenger can luxuriate behind a driver of similar size - and unlike some alternatives, the floor isn’t so high that their knees will be around their ears. There’s even space under the front seats to slide your feet, as well as a totally flat floor so it’s easy to slide across and there’s space for the middle passenger’s feet too. A Skoda Elroq or Kia EV3 have more supportive seats, while the S5 EV’s are more like a flat bench - it’s likely that it wouldn’t be quite so comfortable on a long journey. And they’re not as flexible as some alternatives, either - while there’s a nice comfortable central armrest, there’s no through-loading or ski hatch, nor do they fold in a 40:20:40 arrangement to allow for different arrangements of passengers and luggage. The MG S5 EV’s boot space is 453 litres, which is pretty good - it’s easily comparable to the 460-litre Kia EV3 and 470-litre Skoda Elroq, while eclipsing the Volvo EX30’s 318-litre space. There’s a little bit of underfloor storage ideal for keeping cables, and there’s no load lip with the adjustable floor in place so it’s easy to slide items in. It’s a shame there’s no front boot, though. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories MG’s best dashboard yet - clear, easy to use and higher-quality than before, though still not perfect It really feels as though MG’s been reading Carwow’s reviews of its existing models - where we complain about its awkward touchscreens and plasticky interiors. The S5 EV addresses almost all of our complaints with previous MG models, and is a much nicer place to sit as a result. Starting with the touchscreen - it’s larger in size than on the MG 3 and MG 4, with a taller aspect ratio. This means the interface doesn’t feel as cramped as the letterbox-style arrangements on those cars. The screen itself is bright and very responsive, and the menus make a lot of sense. We’re particularly enamoured by the pull-down bar at the top, which houses a shortcut key to disengage the speed limit warning - that’s a function that took at least ten button presses on the previous MG 4. Speaking of buttons, MG’s also added a full panel of climate controls under the touchscreen, which is a great addition - it allows you to change the temperature or fan speed without having to dive into a touchscreen menu. Wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto come as standard, with a wireless phone charging pad on Trophy models. The biggest surprise, if you’ve sat in an older MG before, is the quality. Materials feel solid to the touch rather than flimsy, and almost every surface gets swathed in supple artificial leather which makes it feel considerably more premium than the ZS EV it replaces. It also feels quite a lot nicer than the base-spec Kia EV3 Air, which gets harder plastics than the rest of its range. Electric range, charging and tax Electric range, charging and tax The basic MG S5 EV has a claimed range of 211 miles, while the Long Range version offers up to 298. During our time with the car, we saw an efficiency figure which suggests around 240 miles is achievable in the real world from the Long Range model. Those figures are on a par with the Volvo EX30 - which claims 209 miles from its regular version and 295 miles from its Extended Range variant - but both are eclipsed by the 270 or 375 mile claimed range of the Kia EV3. The S5 EV does get a heat pump as standard, so its cold-weather performance should be a bit more repeatable than the Kia’s, but it’s a pity that MG currently has no plans to introduce an Extended Range model like it has with the MG 4 EV, as that would give the S5 EV greater flexibility for those who regularly travel further afield. Charging times for the S5 EV are on par with the competition, and you should be able to get a 10-80% top-up in less than 30 minutes from a sufficiently powerful public charger . As an electric car, the S5 EV pays the lowest rate of road tax and company car benefit-in-kind tax, too. Safety and security Safety and security The MG S5 EV has been given a full five-star rating by the safety gurus at Euro NCAP . Reassuringly, it scored 90% in the adult occupant category and 82% for child occupants. This should give you the peace of mind that the S5 EV is a safe family car. You get all the basic safety features plus the MG Pilot assisted driving features bundled in, and they seem to work quite well. The addition of some more physical switchgear to the cabin can’t have hurt safety, nor can the quick shortcut to turn off some of the more annoying beeps and bongs. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems MG’s record on this front is poor to say the least. Though the S5 EV gets the same impressive seven-year/100,000 mile warranty as the rest of MG’s cars, the brand finished stone dead last in the 2024 Driver Power owner satisfaction survey, with owners reporting not just problems with their cars but unhelpful dealers and problems with long lead times for repairs."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/mg/4-xpower,MG4 EV XPOWER REVIEW & PRICES,"€42,699",7/10,new,"Is the MG4 XPower a good car? Is the MG4 XPower a good car? This is the MG4 XPower, and it’s a bit like a supermarket's own-brand vindaloo – packing plenty of heat at a value price. It’s a car you’d consider if you’ve been waiting for the dawn of the electric hot hatch , but the higher-power variants of the Cupra Born or Volkswagen ID3 just don’t offer enough punch for you. Not that the looks of the XPower would suggest it’s the exciting version – not a great deal of change has been made over the base MG4. Orange brake callipers and new 18-inch wheels give the game away if you know what you’re looking for, as do a few polished trim pieces, but the bodywork is otherwise untouched. The stealthy vibe may appeal, but there’s a case to be made that MG could and should have done more to shout about the car’s performance. Similarly, there’s very little difference inside compared with the standard MG4 . Aside from some Alcantara seat and door inserts, as well as a touch of red stitching, there’s nothing to scream XPower here. Material quality continues to impress for the price, but a dull selection of colours and a basic design does nothing to add to the excitement the car’s power promises. Also retained for the XPower is the 10.25-inch infotainment system, packed with sat nav along with support for Android Auto and Apple CarPlay . A few welcome quality-of-life improvements have been made to the software, as well as a basic ‘Track Mode’ app that gives you real-time access to G-force and acceleration data. As with the base MG4, rear passenger space is impressive, with a decent amount of head and legroom even for taller adults. Boot space is also untouched at 363 litres, which is marginally behind the Volkswagen ID3’s 385 litres. The big changes for the MG4 XPower lie under the skin. As well as more power for the rear motor, a second motor has been added to the front axle too, combining to produce 435hp and 600Nm of torque. The result is 0-60mph in a mind-boggling 3.8 seconds (for context, that’s quicker than a Porsche 911 Carrera 4) and an increased top speed of 124mph. It’s not just the off-the-line performance that’s so impressive either, with a real gut-punching kick from 30-70mph too. To help cope with that extra power, MG has made some mechanical tweaks as well. An electronic locking differential has been added alongside a torque vectoring system, which combine to manage how power is distributed to the wheels through corners. The suspension is the same as the base MG4, though with new tuning for the springs and dampers. Though the result is a car that’s certainly capable when you throw it through the bends, it’s not particularly involving. Dull steering makes it difficult to feel how much grip the front wheels have, and even the mechanical upgrades can’t hide the fact this is quite a heavy car. You may outrun a Honda Civic Type R or Hyundai i30 N , but you won’t have as much fun in the twisty stuff. On top of that, because of the suspension tweaks, the MG4 XPower crashes over bumps in the road more so than the regular car, though otherwise remains pretty comfortable around town. At motorway speeds though, you do really notice the wind noise as well as a slight whine from the new front motor. Official range figures from the 64kWh battery dip from 270 miles in the Long Range car to 239 miles for this sporty XPower model. A mixed driving route with the car for this test returned 2.9 miles/kWh, equating to around 185 miles of real-world range. For stomach-churning, sports-car troubling performance at a value price, the MG4 XPower delivers big. That said, traditional hot hatch buyers may struggle to be won over by quite a muted driving experience beyond the numbers. Looking to make this electric hot hatch your next car?

Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort Acceleration is hilariously punchy in a straight line, but the XPower doesn’t deliver on hot hatch driving fun in corners As with most electric cars , the XPower is easy to drive in town. If you make one of the buttons on the steering wheel your brake regeneration adjustment, you can easily cycle from heavy deceleration when you lift off the throttle, to none at all. You will have to dive into the car settings in the infotainment to switch to one-pedal drive though. Using that mode does make slow-speed traffic much easier to drive in. The regeneration effect is pretty severe and you make smooth progress navigating in slower speed limits as you don’t have to touch the brakes. It’s a pain to activate so better to only use it when it’s necessary though. Visibility is good on the whole, although some may find the rear window to be a bit on the narrow side. The XPower gets blind-spot monitoring to make sure you don’t miss cars, bikes or other traffic. With the sportier setup than normal, the XPower doesn’t have the lightest steering, nor the tightest turning circle, but at 11.7 metres it’s more than good enough to get you in and around tight streets and car parks. The standard cameras and rear sensors help a lot too, with the rear sensors even telling you how far you are from an obstacle. As is typical for EVs, the XPower’s efficiency on the motorway does take a hit. Doing so means the 239-mile claimed range does drop a fair amount on a long journey, so make sure you know the best chargers on your route. You do get some wind and tyre noise at cruising speed, but getting there is no trouble at all. The dual motors give you plenty of kick in whatever mode you’re in, and if you choose to be in Sport mode, you’ll find that kick to be even more impressive. Long-distance comfort is pretty good as well, with the cushioning in the seats keeping you comfortable even after long periods behind the wheel. Where hatchbacks with this kind of performance usually perform best is on a twisty backroad. However, while the XPower has a lot of power on offer, the driving dynamics aren’t up to the same level. The steering feels pretty vague at the best of times, so it’s not easy to know how much grip the tyres have, and although it does turn into a corner quite quickly, it never feels fun – something a hot hatch really should. You’ll also find the suspension to be on the firmer side which means there's less body roll than you would expect for a higher riding hatchback such as this, but that can mean some bumps and potholes send a fair jolt into the cabin. You’ll also hear those noises echo around the cabin a little as well. Space and practicality Space and practicality There’s ample room for most in terms of cabin storage and passenger space, but the boot could be bigger For those in the front, the MG 4 XPower has more than enough room. You can easily get comfortable on the electrically-adjustable Alcantara and leather seats, while the steering column for the driver offers rake and reach adjustment. Although the surfaces are quite dark, you have pretty large windows to make it feel light and airy enough – making it feel more spacious inside. You’ll also find plenty of storage for all your things. You have a grippy wireless charging pad for your smartphone, cupholders below that are next to a bin with a sliding cover and there’s a useful space underneath the armrest. The doorbins are a good size too, although as they’re unlined, you’ll find that metal bottles or keys can rattle around. As with the standard 4, the XPower has a good amount of room for passengers in the back. Most adults have enough space, although taller people may find headroom a little tight. There's a good amount of legroom, while the flat floor means you’ll have enough space to fit three sets of feet across the back. The storage space isn’t too bad either, with doorbins, seat pockets and even a small area for your smartphone also on offer. While the 363-litre boot space is likely big enough for most, you’ll find that other high-powered EVs of a similar size offer more room. The Volkswagen ID3 and Cupra Born have 385 litres, but the Smart #1 Brabus offers a fair bit less at 273 litres. The space itself is a useful shape, as it’s mostly square and you don’t have much of a load lip to lift things over. There are also small bins either side and a space under the floor, but not enough to keep your charging cables. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories There’s little excitement in terms of the MG’s design and the infotainment can be glitchy, but the displays are clear enough While the exterior design of the MG is sharp, interesting and – in a bright colour – cool to look at, the interior doesn’t quite live up to that level. Sure there are some cool angles and different tones, but you’ll find that it’s mostly black and dark grey surfaces with some small touches of red. The higher levels of the cabin are covered in squishier materials that feel nicer to the touch than the scratchier plastics further down, while the leather steering wheel with gloss plastic trim pieces is nice to hold – but those bits of trim can smudge very quickly. With the two star buttons on the wheel, you can choose to switch between the drive and brake regeneration modes easily. Mounted under the 10.25-inch infotainment touchscreen is the silver gear selector, which you press to engage Park and twist to switch between drive or reverse. It’s intuitive to use but you can find that there are times the car doesn’t respond and you need to give it a minute before the gear selector responds. It doesn’t happen often thankfully. Coming back to the screen, it’s fairly easy to use, with day and night modes just like on a smartphone. It isn’t the most responsive and can be quite glitchy. You’ll find that it kicks you out of Apple CarPlay and Android Auto while you’re driving sometimes, and that means you’ll have to pull over to get it working again. If you use the infotainment system’s built-in sat-nav you’ll be fine, though. The driver’s display could be brighter, but the graphics are easy to read and toggle through using the controls on the steering wheel. Electric range, charging and tax Electric range, charging and tax From the 66kWh battery pack, the 239-mile claimed range isn’t the most impressive on the market. What we can give MG credit for is that you will consistently be near that figure when you fully charge it up, even when the conditions are on the colder side. To achieve that mileage figure, you’ll need to average 3.6miles per kWh, which you can get pretty close to in normal driving conditions. You can charge at up to 150kW on a rapid charger, meaning a 10-80% charge takes just 35 minutes, while doing a 10-100% charge from a 7kW wallbox takes eight and a half hours, meaning an overnight charge is simple As an EV, you won’t need to pay car tax on the MG4 XPower until 2025, and for those looking for a good company car tax break, the MG sits in a low benefit-in-kind bracket. Safety and security Safety and security The XPower comes with the same Euro NCAP rating as the standard MG4. That means a five-out-of-five-star score, with high ratings across the four parameters. As standard, you get MG’s Advanced Driver Assistance Systems, which mean the XPower gets active emergency braking, lane keep assist, traffic jam assist, blind spot detection, rear cross traffic alert and adaptive cruise control. You’ll also find airbags all around, ISOFIX points on the outermost rear seats, hill start assist, emergency brake assist and an immobiliser. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems As the MG4 is still relatively new to the market, there isn’t much news in terms of reliability or major faults. With each new MG, you get a seven-year warranty from the manufacturer, which is one of the best in the business and only beaten by Kia , Toyota and Lexus . You can also get roadside assistance and servicing."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/mg/cyberster,MG Cyberster Review & Prices,"€67,269",7/10,new,"Is the MG Cyberster a good car? Is the MG Cyberster a good car? The MG Cyberster is, arguably, the first drop-top electric sports car . It joins a vanishingly small cohort of electric convertibles that includes the short-lived Mini Electric Convertible , colossally expensive Maserati GranCabrio Folgore and the hardly-a-convertible Fiat 500e Cabrio plus its Abarth sibling. The Cyberster represents the meeting of MG’s past and future. The brand’s history is in building convertible sports cars, but the last few years have been all about electrification. It’s like a Silver Cross buggy - inspired by the baby carriages of the past but definitely a product of the present with all the modern features buyers expect. MG’s also been sure to include a few features that nobody was expecting - hardcore MG fans or otherwise. The Cyberster looks like nothing else on the road, with insectoid headlights, squat proportions that make it look quite a lot smaller than it is and a wild rear featuring arrow-shaped taillights and a full-width lightbar. The wow factor increases with the doors, which are electrically-operated scissor doors that open up and away rather than outwards. It’s fair to say that if you arrive somewhere in a Cyberster, you’re guaranteed to make an entrance whether you want to or not - in fact, get used to being stopped in car parks, or having people’s heads turn in traffic. The flip side is that you can’t really arrive anywhere discreetly - and those party piece doors can be frustratingly slow to operate. The interior isn’t short of issues either, most of which come from its eye-catching quadruple-screen layout. That’s right - four screens, with three pivoted towards the driver and a fourth in the centre console for climate controls. Range: 276 miles / 316 miles Efficiency: 3.3-3.7mi/kWh Battery size: 77kWh Max charge speed: 144kW Charge time AC: 10hrs 30mins, 10-100%, 7kW Charge time DC: 38mins, 10-80%, 144kW Charge port location: Left side rear Power outputs: 340hp / 510hp If it sounds confusing, that’s because it is - the outer screens are constantly blocked by the steering wheel, and it’s never particularly clear which functions you control via which screen. At least the driver’s display is clear and concise. The rest of the interior is largely successful. It’s roomy enough, and storage consists of a glovebox, a big shelf behind the seats useful for bags or coats, tiny door bins and a couple of cubbies in the centre console. Material quality is excellent, and build quality isn’t too bad either - not up to the standards of a Porsche , but then the Cyberster makes even the petrol-engined Porsche Boxster look like a bargain. One potential issue rears its ugly head for tall drivers, though, as the seats are set very high. You never really feel as if you’re sat ‘in’ the Cyberster - more like you’re perched on top of it - and if you’re over six feet tall or have a long torso you may find your head brushing the roof. The roof, incidentally, is an electrically-operated fabric affair. It goes down swiftly and can be operated at speeds up to 28mph, which is really useful if you’re hit by a sudden rainstorm, and when it’s up it does a good job of keeping the heat in and the noise out. Not that there’s much noise to be heard. It’s quite disconcerting being in a convertible car that makes nothing more than a soft whirr on acceleration. Like most electric cars, the Cyberster is swift - even the basic rear-wheel drive model will give hot hatchbacks a run for their money, while the fastest dual-motor version has supercar pace. Despite this, it doesn’t feel sporty to drive. The Cyberster is comfortable, quiet and reasonably relaxing, but if you push it into a set of corners you soon feel that it’s a very heavy car with relatively uncommunicative steering. Despite appearances, it’s more of a boulevard cruiser than an out-and-out sports car. You’ll even be able to cruise for a decent distance, with an official range figure of more than 300 miles in the entry-level car. As a package, there’s a lot to love about the MG Cyberster. It’s not a pedigree performance car, but if you’re looking for a drop-top cruiser it does a fantastic job of being comfortable, offering punchy performance when you need it, and feeling largely high quality inside.

How much is the MG Cyberster? MG Cyberster prices start at around £55,000 for the Trophy and rise to nearly £60,000 for the high-performance GT version, which feels pretty good value given the big hike in power. It’s tough to compare it to anything on price, but that’s a bit more than the starting price of a petrol-powered Porsche 718 Boxster, but less than an all-electric Porsche Taycan . Aside from the extra motor that increases the power output and provides all-wheel drive, equipment levels are identical between the two trims, apart from the fact that GT models get 20-inch alloy wheels compared with 19 inches on Trophy cars. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort Comfortable and rapid, but the MG Cyberster is easily unsettled by bumps when you’re attacking a twisty road The MG Cyberster is composed and relaxing to drive around town. You get the EV-typical instant response of the electric motors and near-silent propulsion, as well as a one-pedal mode to make traffic even easier. The Cyberster also handles bumps well at lower speeds – sure, it jiggles about a bit, but you never get any wince-worthy pothole crunches. It’s low, though, so large speed bumps can hit the bottom of the car, which never feels nice. Because of the battery pack beneath the car, you sit fairly high. This can be annoying when you’re going for a sporty drive, but around town it’s great because the low dashboard means you have good visibility ahead of you. Rear visibility is poor, but standard-fit parking sensors and a 360-degree reversing camera help in a tight spot. That comfortable suspension, soft seat upholstery and relatively spacious cabin mean that long distances are no trouble in the MG Cyberster. It’s a bit noisy at 70mph, with wind and road noise naturally higher than you’d get in a non-convertible car, but it’s nothing unbearable. MG Pilot is included as standard, which brings kit such as lane-keeping assistance and blind spot detection, while adaptive cruise control is also fitted to both versions. This maintains your speed as well as distance to the car in front, and takes the strain out of long motorway drives. When you look at the sleek, sporty styling and 510hp output of the GT model, it’s easy to think this is a proper performance car. However, the MG Cyberster never feels happy being driven hard – there’s loads of grip, particularly in the GT with all-wheel drive catapulting you out of corners even in the wet – but the suspension struggles with bumpy roads at speed and the steering doesn’t tell you much about what the front tyres are doing. As a result, it’s better to rein it in and just enjoy the scenery, at which point the Cyberster feels much more enjoyable to drive and less seat-of-your-pants. If you want something to attack a twisty road, a Porsche 718 Boxster is still your best bet, or you can wait for the imminent electric version… Space and practicality Space and practicality The cabin is spacious by two-seater standards, though the boot is quite small The MG Cyberster isn’t as small as it looks, which means it’s actually fairly spacious inside. Even taller drivers should be able to find a comfortable driving position, though the seat doesn’t go very low, which is mildly frustrating. The door bins are hidden behind covers, but they're tiny and largely pointless, though you do get a couple of cupholders between the front seats, as well as a small glovebox and an area beneath the armrest. There’s nowhere for a wireless charging pad, but you do get USB-A and USB-C slots for phone charging and infotainment connection. The MG Cyberster is a two-seater, but there is a shelf behind the seats with a net to hold your items in place. It’s just about big enough for a couple of backpacks, handbags or somewhere to put a light shop. It’s also designed to hold the wind deflector when you don’t want to use it. The boot isn’t particularly big at 249 litres, though there’s enough space for a weekly shop for a small family, or some bags for a weekend away. Access isn’t easy though, with the opening not being particularly big and sitting up high meaning you have to lift items over the rear bumper. Convertibles such as this never have huge boots, but the Cyberster does have a bit less than the Porsche 718 Boxster (275 litres) and BMW Z4 (280 litres). Disappointingly for an electric car, there's no front boot either. However, unlike some convertibles, the boot is the same size whether the roof is up or down, and it's quite deep - so you can get larger bags in without too much of an issue. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories Quality is decent overall, but there are some cheap switches and the screens are poorly positioned On the whole, interior quality is great and feels like a big step up on anything you’ll have seen from MG before. Dashboard materials and seat upholstery look and feel just about posh enough for the price tag, and the design is simple with a hint of classic roadster. It’s far from perfect, though. The upswinging doors are cool, but they’re not particularly quick and it can become tiresome if you want to quickly jump in or out, while the chunky switches for this and the fabric roof feel a bit cheap and plasticky. It’s the array of screens that are the bigger complaint, though. All have a clear resolution and respond quickly to your inputs, but they’re a bit of an ergonomic mess. The central climate screen is positioned well, but the process of scrolling through different temperatures is wholly unintuitive. There are no complaints about the 10.3-inch instrument display ahead of you, but the 7.0-inch displays either side are partially obscured by the steering wheel. The one on the right has some largely uninteresting information about your charge state and energy flow etc, but the one on the left has your maps, so you’ll often find yourself leaning to the side to see when the next junction is or check your ETA. It's never particular clear which screen you should use for which function - some settings are on the right screen, for instance, while others are hidden in the climate control screen. The one to the left is also where you'll see your smartphone mirroring through Apple CarPlay or Android Auto , and it's quite a cramped display for these purposes. You also only get a wired connection, and there's not much space under the armrest to keep your smartphone - so it'll have to be wedged down the side of a seat or balanced on the centre console. Electric range, charging and tax Electric range, charging and tax There are two versions of the MG Cyberster – an entry-level single-motor version and a more powerful dual-motor. Single-motor Trophy cars make 340hp, which is sent to the rear wheels. The 0-62mph time of 5.0 seconds proves this is hardly a ‘slow’ version though, being near enough identical to an entry-level Porsche 718 Boxster. If you want the performance-focused GT, you get all-wheel drive from the dual-motor setup, providing 510hp and a 0-62mph sprint of just 3.2 seconds – that’s proper supercar pace. To keep the Porsche comparison alive, that’s not far off a £130,000 911 GTS… Both Cyberster models get the same 77kWh battery, so as you’d expect all the GT’s extra power limits range somewhat. The official distance between charges for Trophy cars is 316 miles, compared with 276 miles for the GT. Those are respectable figures, though if you’re regularly enjoying all 510hp you can expect the range to drop quickly – on a spirited drive in the Scottish Highlands we saw efficiency of 2.5mi/kWh in the GT, which would equate to a range of about 200 miles, though you could probably eke another 10-20 miles in more typical driving scenarios. The maximum charge rate is fairly good at 144kW, which MG claims should take you from 10-80% in 38 minutes, while a 7kW home charge will top the battery up in just over 10 hours. Like all new EVs as of April 2025, first year road tax for the Cyberster is £10, with the standard rate applying after the first year onwards. If you’re lucky enough to get a Cyberster as a company car, the benefit-in-kind rate will be 3% until the 2026/27 financial year, when it goes up to 4%. Safety and security Safety and security The MG Cyberster has not been safety tested by Euro NCAP , though the MG4 EV scored the full five stars when it was tested in 2022, which should be reassuring, particularly as the Cyberster gets a lot of assistance kit as standard. Whichever model you go for you get all the same safety and security systems, which includes MG Pilot (lane-keeping assistance, blind spot monitoring and more) as well as tech that disengages the keyfob’s signal for keyless entry when not in use, making keyless car theft impossible. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems MG came stone-dead last in the 2024 Driver Power reliability survey, which isn’t exactly confidence building. However, with the Cyberster being an EV, it should be more reliable than a petrol equivalent sports car, although those scissor doors might be problematic in years to come. It’s fortunate that the Cyberster gets the same warranty as MG’s regular models, which means you get seven years or 80,000 miles of cover, which is one of the best in the business.

https://www.carwow.co.uk/omoda/omoda-9,OMODA Omoda 9 Review & Prices,"€52,638",7/10,new,"Is the Omoda 9 a good car? Is the Omoda 9 a good car? The Omoda 9 is a roomy SUV that offers big car space for small(er) car money. You get loads of technology for the price as well as a smooth, efficient hybrid engine, but it’s not great to drive and the infotainment is a pain to use. Buying the Omoda 9 is a bit like choosing a Tesco Finest ready meal. It doesn’t have the instant appeal of an established brand name, but that doesn’t mean it’s not tasty. There are plenty of established names to consider alongside the Omoda 9. There’s the Kia Sportage , the Volkswagen Tiguan , the Toyota RAV4 and the Cupra Terramar , all offering something slightly different depending on your wants and needs. The Omoda 9 has an imposing front end design, with vertical daytime running lights not dissimilar to those on the Rolls-Royce Cullinan , and a high bonnet line that will fill the rear-view mirror of the car ahead. Inside there’s a hint of poshness with sleek lines running across the dashboard from the doors, along with synthetic leather upholstery. It doesn’t totally stand up to scrutiny; the leather feels a bit thin and some of the plastics feel a bit cheap, but quality is about on par with the likes of the Kia Sportage overall. The bulky centre console and limited steering wheel adjustment mean it’s a touch cramped for the driver, but every other seat has plenty of room, and at 660 litres the boot is bigger than most alternatives can offer. The infotainment system responds quickly, but the menus are confusing to navigate and trying to get your head around the various drive modes and settings is baffling. It comes with loads of kit, though, such as standard-fit heated and ventilated seats – front and rear. But while the semi-autonomous driver assistance might sound appealing at this price point, it's so badly implemented you’re better off sticking to the standard adaptive cruise control so it doesn’t feel like you’re constantly fighting the car to stay centred in your lane. Despite this frustration, in general driving the hybrid engine is excellent. The electric motors power the wheels, with the petrol engine acting more like a generator most of the time to keep the battery topped up. The result is the smoothness of electric driving more of the time, making it easy to drive around town, with none of the range concerns if you venture out onto the motorway. By plug-in hybrid standards it has a massive electric-only range of over 90 miles – double what some alternatives can manage. That means if you have home charging and don’t do massive journeys, you’ll rarely need the petrol engine at all. If you do head out on long motorway journeys the comfort-focused suspension makes the Omoda 9 a refined thing to while away the miles. However, this does have the knock on effect of making the body roll around quite a bit, which is particularly noticeable on winding country roads. It takes a lot to topple the likes of the Volkswagen Tiguan and Kia Sportage among family SUVs, but the Omoda 9 makes a case for itself if you really need the extra space. Some annoying quirks mean it’s not quite as polished overall as those alternatives, though. Still, if its value for money appeals you can check out the latest Omoda 9 deals on Carwow, or browse Omoda 9 lease deals. You can also check out used Omoda cars from our network of trusted dealers, and when it’s time to sell your current car , Carwow can help with that, too. How much is the Omoda 9? How much is the Omoda 9? The Omoda 9 has a very simple pricing structure – the car starts at around £45,000 and you get all of the kit included, with the only optional extra being paint. That means you get loads of standard equipment, from the usual Apple CarPlay and Android Auto , to more impressive kit such as parking cameras, adaptive cruise control and heated and ventilated seats all round. Plug-in hybrid-engined alternatives, such as the Volkswagen Tiguan and Toyota RAV4, start at a fraction less than the Omoda, but similarly-specced versions cost more. The Kia Sportage has the lowest starting price at about £40,000 for a PHEV, with top-spec models around the same as the Omoda for a car that’s a bit smaller but almost identically equipped. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort Smooth and economical engine is a highlight, but the suspension is too bouncy Around town the Omoda 9 drives like an electric car , because the motors drive the wheels most of the time. That means it’s quiet and smooth at low speeds, with plenty of performance for when you need to nip into gaps in traffic. The suspension is a mixed bag, because it’s generally comfortable, but sharp impacts – such as potholes and speed bumps – create an uncomfortable jolt. The view is fine looking forward, but the rear pillars and small rear window make visibility out of the back quite poor. Fortunately you get a surround-view camera system to help navigate tight spots, and it even shows what’s under the car. Motorway speeds are where the Omoda 9 is at its best. The suspension settles down to be pretty comfortable at higher speeds, and there’s not a huge amount of wind and road noise to annoy you on a long drive. Unfortunately though, some of the driver assistance tech frustrates. It’s great that the Omoda 9 comes with a semi-autonomous driving aid for motorway driving as standard, but the steering wheel constantly feels like it’s fighting you to position the car where it wants in the lane, switching on and off every few seconds when it senses you correct it. Fortunately you can hold the button on the wheel that activates the system, and it switches to a more traditional adaptive cruise control, which maintains your speed and distance to the car in front with no steering input from the car. This works perfectly well. Away from smooth motorways the suspension becomes noticeable again. The constant lumps and ridges common to British B-roads cause the car to bounce around a bit so it’s never really settled. There’s plenty of power on offer, so it can be fun to accelerate hard out of corners, but couple the bouncy suspension with the light, city-friendly steering and this is not a family SUV that encourages you to take the scenic route home. That’s largely true of alternatives too, to be fair, though most feel a bit more planted and confidence-inspiring. Although the Cupra Terramar isn’t as comfortable the rest of the time, the trade off is that it’s one of the more fun family SUVs on a country road. Space and practicality Space and practicality A big boot and spacious cabin are good, but the front seats don’t have much adjustability Although you get the appealing tall driving position of an SUV, the seat doesn’t go very low at all, meaning tall drivers can feel like they’re sitting on top of the car rather than in it. There’s also not a great deal of steering wheel adjustment, so you have to sit a bit closer than you would perhaps like. Again, this impacts taller drivers more because the centre console is large and high, so doesn’t give you much space for your left leg. This is unlikely to be a huge issue for anyone under six-foot, though we did also find that the seat cushion wasn’t particularly wide, so your right hip is resting on the side bolster, which becomes annoying on long drives. Storage is excellent though, with a huge covered area beneath the armrest, two cup holders – which are removable to create even more storage, all of which is also covered – and a space under the main screen for two phones. The glovebox is a useful size and it’s damped so it opens smoothly, while the door bins have room for a big water bottle. Those travelling in the back have loads of space, with plenty of kneeroom and lots of headroom, while the seats can recline a little too. The floor is a touch high, so you don’t get great support under your thighs, and it’s a touch tight for three abreast, but we’re nitpicking – it’s comfortably above average among alternatives. This has the added benefit of meaning you have loads of space for even the bulkiest child seats, and the ISOFIX mounting points are easy to access. They’re also under flip-up covers, so you won’t lose them. Practicality extends to the boot, with the Omoda 9 having one of the bigger boots of similarly priced SUV. At 660 litres it’s slightly bigger than the Volkswagen Tiguan, though it does fall behind the five-seater Skoda Kodiaq ’s massive 910-litre boot, or the 952 litres you get in the Peugeot 5008 if you fold the third row of seats. Everything else is well behind – you get 591 litres in the Kia Sportage, 540 litres in the Cupra Terramar and 520 litres in the Toyota RAV4. The space is usefully square, though it’s not particularly tall so carrying larger items could be a bit tricky. A good amount of underfloor storage means you can store valuables out of sight, though. Folding the rear seats opens up loads of storage space, and there’s no ridge in the floor to worry about, so you can push heavy items through easily. There’s no release in the boot though, so you have to reach in or walk around to fold the rear seats. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories The Omoda 9 looks pretty posh inside, but the infotainment system is a pain to use Jump aboard the Omoda 9 and first impressions are good. The large, sweeping dashboard and synthetic leather upholstery has a more upmarket appearance than a Kia Sportage, and the bulky centre console makes the car feel more solid and substantial than alternatives. Poke and prod around and it’s not up to the standards of the posher machinery it apes from the likes of Volvo and Mercedes – the climate dials aren’t sufficiently weighty and the plastic button for the armrest feels a bit basic, for example – but it’s at least on par with the likes of Kia and Toyota, which it is priced in line with. You get two displays housed within a large black bezel. Both are 12.3 inches, with the one behind the wheel displaying driving information such as your speed and fuel economy, while the one to the left is your touchscreen infotainment. It’s really quick to load menus and respond to your inputs, but navigating your way around the menus and various settings is borderline infuriating because they’re not particularly logically laid out. And if you use Apple CarPlay and Android Auto there are no quick shortcuts in and out, meaning any changes you want to make require multiple presses to switch between these and the native system, which requires regular glances away from the road. And then the driver monitoring system will shout at you for not looking straight ahead. The large dials in the centre control the climate settings, which is really useful so you’re not digging around in menus to change the temperature, while the middle one changes your drive mode. MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax The engine is the stand out feature of the Omoda 9. Under the bonnet sits a 1.5-litre petrol engine paired to a battery-powered electric motor. You get a combined 449hp, which is a hilariously huge amount of performance for a family car. Pop the car into ‘sport’ mode and it certainly feels quick enough, if not as whipcrack rapid as the numbers suggest. But it’s best to leave it in ‘normal’ or ‘eco’, where the system runs primarily on electric power, meaning it’s quiet and smooth. If you do call on the petrol engine it’s so smooth you’ll barely notice. After a few hours with the car it was hovering around 45mpg, which is impressive for a hybrid-powered car of this size, though this was in the setting that forces the engine to keep the battery above 70%. In its intelligent hybrid mode, expect over 50mpg even on longer trips. That’s helped by the massive range – officially you can travel up to 93 miles on electric power alone, which is about double what most alternatives offer. If you have home charging and don’t travel too far too often, it’s reasonable to suggest you could go days without even calling on petrol power… The other advantage to this is that having such a long electric range makes the Omoda 9 incredibly tempting for company car choosers, with a Benefit-in-Kind rate that’s not much higher than electric cars. It also falls into the second cheapest bracket for first year Vehicle Excise Duty , though it does incur the expensive car supplement for years two to six. Safety and security Safety and security Although the Omoda 9 has not been safety tested by the experts at Euro NCAP , it shares some of its technology with the Jaecoo 7 , which scored top marks. Further hinting at a good score for the Omoda is the extensive assistance kit that comes as standard, including emergency lane departure prevention, rear cross traffic braking and advanced cruise control. You also get four ISOFIX mounting points for child seats. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems Being so new to the UK, it’s difficult to know how reliable the Omoda 9 will be, as there aren’t too many owner stories to go on and the brand hasn’t appeared in the Driver Power survey yet. However, reassuringly it comes with a massive seven-year/100,000-mile warranty, which is one of the longest in the UK. Omoda 9 FAQs Omoda 9 FAQs"
https://www.carwow.co.uk/omoda/omoda-e5,OMODA E5 Review & Prices,"€39,564",6/10,new,"Is the Omoda E5 a good car? Is the Omoda E5 a good car? If you’re looking for an electric car that’s anything but the obvious choice, the Omoda E5 could be the SUV for you. This, and the petrol-powered 5 , are the first models to be sold in the UK by Chinese car maker Omoda. It’s a bit like saying no to a Microsoft Surface laptop and picking a Huawei MateBook instead. While you might not have heard of Omoda, the E5 is an alternative to lots of similarly priced electric SUVs from companies you probably have heard of, including the Volvo EX30 , Smart #1 , Hyundai Kona Electric and Skoda Enyaq . The Cupra Born is another option if you’re not totally committed to the SUV body shape. The Omoda E5 isn’t the most stylish thing to look at. The electric version gets a smoother front end than the petrol model’s mega-grille, and you get narrow daytime running lights that look pretty cool at night, but it’s a largely bland and inoffensive design. Range: 257 miles Efficiency: 3.8 miles per kWh Battery size: 61kWh Max charge speed: 80kW Charge time AC: 8hrs, 0-100%, 11kW Charge time DC: 28mins, 30-80%, 80kW Charge port location: Front Power outputs: 204hp It’s much better inside. The overall design is smart, the materials look good quality, and largely feel pretty premium to the touch. The massive twin-screen setup works pretty well – both displays have sharp, bright graphics and are pretty snappy to respond to your inputs, though some of the menus are really confusing to find your way around. Funnily enough, it’s a similar story with other Chinese brands , BYD and MG . Ergonomically it’s less positive. The steering wheel and driver’s seat don’t have enough adjustment, and the pedals are quite close, so it’s a struggle to find a comfortable driving position. The centre console is also too big and intrudes into your personal space, so it’s difficult to relax your left leg on long journeys. And when it comes to practicality, the E5 is a bit of a reverse Tardis, because when you look at the outside you’re expecting it to be a bit more roomy inside than it is. Space in the back is limited in particular, and it can be a bit of a faff to fit a child seat, while storage throughout is fine but about the minimum you’d expect. The boot is smaller than alternatives, too. At 380 litres it’s only a fraction down on the Cupra Born, but that car is a hatchback . SUVs like the Hyundai Kona Electric and Skoda Enyaq have massive boots by comparison, though the Smart #1 lags well behind all here. You have one choice of battery and motor in the Omoda E5, with a 204hp output and an official range of 257 miles, which is about the same as you get from entry-level versions of the alternatives we’ve been looking at here, all of which are a bit more expensive than the Omoda. Fast charging speeds are pretty poor, which can be annoying on long trips, but efficiency is decent, so it’ll be a bit cheaper than your average EV to run. The recurring theme with the Omoda E5 is that it’s fine, but others do it better, and that’s also true of the way it drives. The suspension is soft so it soaks up bumps pretty well, and the steering is well-tuned so it’s easy to place the car on the road, but there’s quite a bit of tyre noise at higher speeds. It’s not particularly fast, but it goes round corners without feeling like it will fall over. It’s good enough if you don’t care about how a car drives, but the Cupra Born and Hyundai Kona Electric in particular feel more satisfying to drive at any speed. As a first entry to the UK market this is an intriguing electric SUV. It’s packed full of technology for the cash, and looks pretty upmarket inside, but it falls behind other options in most of the key details. It’s a bit cheaper than those cars, but budget-allowing, they’re worth the extra cash. If you want to get a great price, check out the latest Omoda E5 deals on Carwow. You can also browse used Omoda models from our network of trusted dealers, and when it’s time to sell your current car, Carwow can help with that, too. How much is the Omoda E5? How much is the Omoda E5? The Omoda E5 is priced temptingly. Of the best electric SUVs at a similar cost, only the Smart #1 undercuts it, and even then only just. That car is a bit more spacious in the back seats but has a much smaller boot. Otherwise the Hyundai Kona Electric is a bit more expensive, and the Skoda Enyaq more expensive still. The Cupra Born is a little pricier than the Omoda, and isn’t an SUV, but it offers similar practicality and is much more enjoyable to drive. The Omoda E5 does get some great kit as standard, though. There are two trims, with the entry-level Comfort model getting LED lights all round, the twin-screen setup inside, and all the same assistance kit as the top-spec Noble, such as adaptive cruise control and lane departure warning. Noble models get full synthetic leather seats with heating, a power sunroof, and a Sony sound system. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort The Omoda E5 is pleasant to drive and handles bumps pretty well, but it’s a bit noisy on the motorway and not much fun on a twisty road The Omoda E5 is fairly easy and relaxing to drive around town, and it’s nicer than the petrol-powered 5, because you don’t have to deal with the clunky gearbox. The electric motors are smooth, and the brakes are pretty good once you’re on the move, but when you’re travelling at slow speeds they’re really difficult to judge. It’s almost like they’re fully on or off, meaning crawling in traffic or manoeuvring around your driveway can be quite a jerky experience. The suspension deals with bumps pretty well though, so it’s comfortable on rubbish road surfaces. Visibility isn’t great, because although the view out the front isn’t too bad (unless you’re tall, because the seat position forces you to sit quite high), the view out of the back isn’t great. You get front and rear parking sensors and a rear-view camera as standard, while top-spec models get a 360-degree camera. Motorway cruising is where the Omoda E5 is at its best. The electric motors are just about punchy enough that overtaking and getting up to speed on a slip road are no drama, and it’s generally pretty quiet, apart from some noticeable road noise. The seats are comfortable, but the intrusion of the centre console means it’s difficult to really relax your left leg, which can become annoying on longer journeys. The Hyundai Kona Electric is a more relaxing car to take on a long journey. Assistance kit is useful, with adaptive cruise control fitted as standard, along with systems to keep you from drifting out of your lane, though it can feel like the car is fighting you if you get too close to a white line. Twisty roads are not the best place for an Omoda E5. The soft suspension means the body leans quite a bit, and it never really gives you confidence to drive quickly. However, the steering is nicely judged, so it feels natural and easy to place the car on the road. Some of the lane-keeping kit can be intrusive on particularly narrow roads though, which can be a bit unnerving in the face of oncoming traffic. To be fair to the E5, few affordable electric SUVs are great fun on a winding B-road, but the Volvo EX30 is the pick of the bunch. If you can stretch your budget the Tesla Model Y is worth a look, too. Space and practicality Space and practicality There are some useful storage spaces inside but the rear seats are a squeeze and the boot isn’t very big Space in the front isn’t too bad, with electric adjustment for the driver’s seat as standard, and included for the passenger seat on the top Noble trim. However, there’s not as much adjustability in the seat and steering wheel as you might want, which makes it difficult to get a comfortable driving position. The centre console feels a bit too big, which makes the space for your legs a touch cramped. Storage is okay though, with a good-sized glovebox and door bins, and a big space beneath the armrest. You also get a large area beneath the centre console that’s ideal for storing a handbag or small backpack. There’s a 12V socket as well as two USB-C slots, though these are on the passenger side, which makes them a bit fiddly to get to. There’s less space in the rear seats than you’re expecting of a car this size. Kneeroom is okay, but headroom is a bit tight, and the floor is high so your thighs don’t rest on the seat cushions. It’s a bit narrow for three, too. Storage is a bit less impressive in the back than it is in the front, with door bins and seat pockets being about the minimum you could want. There are USB-C and A slots in the back so rear passengers can charge their devices. Fitting a child seat is possible with ISOFIX mounting points in the outer rear seats, but because space isn’t great you might find bulkier rear-facing seats don’t fit too well. The doors don’t open particularly wide either. The boot capacity is 380 litres, which is fine if the most you carry is the weekly shop, but even the Cupra Born hatchback has a bit more space at 385 litres. The Hyundai Kona Electric is massive by comparison though, at 466 litres, and if you’re able to spend a bit more the Skoda Enyaq outshines even that at 585 litres. The Smart #1 and Volvo EX30 have less boot space at 273 litres and 318 litres respectively. It’s not like it makes up for a lack of space with some nifty tricks to make the most of the area on offer, as there’s no underfloor storage or hooks for holding bags, but you do at least get a 12V socket. Folding the seats isn’t too difficult because you can reach in from the boot to do it. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories The interior design looks pretty posh and the screens are crisp and clear, but it’s lacking in the finer details First impressions of the Omoda E5’s interior are good. You get two large screens – one for the infotainment and one for the instruments – and the design is classy with materials that all look pretty premium. There are some neat strips of colour and ambient lighting to lift the interior, and generally material quality feels about right for the price, but it’s easy to find some cheaper plastics in the cabin. Those prominent screens work really well, though. The 12.3-inch infotainment screen has sharp graphics and it’s quick to respond to inputs, but its menu layouts are confusing so it can take some time to learn where everything is. It’s not always particularly logical, and some of the buttons are small, making them tricky to tap on the move. The 12.3-inch instrument screen is similarly crisp in its appearance and has all the information you need. Electric range, charging and tax Electric range, charging and tax You have a single motor and battery option in the Omoda E5. It uses a 204hp motor to power the front wheels, and a 61kWh battery with a range of 257 miles. Official tests put efficiency at 3.8 miles per kWh, which is pretty good and actually exactly what we saw during our time with the car. That measures up pretty well with alternatives, but where the Omoda E5 is let down slightly is its fast charging. It has a maximum charge speed of 80kW, which isn’t great, and is likely why Omoda claims a 30-80% fast charging time of 28 minutes. Most manufacturers show a fast charge time of under half an hour, but this is usually from 10-80%... Still, being an electric car means that your company car tax will be very low, and the Omoda E5 has no road tax associated with it either. Safety and security Safety and security The petrol-powered Omoda 5 scored five-out-of-five in Euro NCAP safety tests, and its ratings in each category should translate to the electric model, too. The vast majority of driver assistance kit is included as standard on the Omoda E5, which is nice because you don’t have to pay extra for safety and security. It comes with adaptive cruise control, front and rear collision warning, lane departure warning and prevention, and rear cross traffic alert. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems It’s impossible to predict the Omoda E5’s reliability because the brand is so new to the UK. However, reassuringly the company offers a seven-year, 100,000-mile warranty, which puts it up there with the best available, such as Kia and MG . You also get a separate eight-year, 100,000-mile warranty for the main battery, and Omoda offers roadside assistance support. Omoda E5 FAQs Omoda E5 FAQs"
https://www.carwow.co.uk/omoda/omoda-5,OMODA 5 Review & Prices,"€31,374",6/10,new,"Is the Omoda 5 a good car? Is the Omoda 5 a good car? In the early 2000s it was Hyundai and Kia that were offering cheap ‘n’ cheerful cars with loads of standard equipment and small price tags - in the 2020s, it’s the Chinese. Omoda is the latest Chinese car brand to hit the UK, and it’s doing so with this - the Omoda 5 SUV. And in the same way that a Greggs opening up shop next to a local bakery will cause some raised eyebrows, the Omoda aims to offer customers the same stuff they’re used to, but at a lower price. Other budget SUVs it’s taking aim at include the MG HS , Skoda Karoq and our favourite, the Citroen C5 Aircross . A quick word about Omoda. While the brand is new to the UK, it’s been on sale in Asian territories for a while and is an offshoot of one of China’s biggest manufacturers - Chery, which sells about as many cars worldwide as Tesla. So don’t go thinking this is a bit player. There’s certainly nothing surprising about the styling. The Omoda 5 could charitably brand itself as ‘inspired’ by existing SUVs rather than straight copying them - this does mean it’s pretty bland and inoffensive to look at, though the glitzy grille is a little brash. Sculptured flanks, ‘upside-down’ headlight arrangements and a full-width element joining the rear lights is all pretty par for the course. It’s smart, but you won’t stand out in a crowd. For interior space, the Omoda 5 lags behind the competition. It’s not a particularly small car, but rear legroom is quite poor and headroom in both rows of seats is pretty dreadful. Small rear doors also make loading child seats a pain, and the boot is a cramped 380 litres in capacity - about the same size as a regular family hatchback’s. The 5 does win back some points when you look at the standard equipment list, though. Even the base-spec ‘Comfort’ model gets all-round LED lights, a twin-screen dashboard setup, heated and electrically-adjustable front seats, and wireless smartphone connectivity. You also get a powerful 190hp engine and an automatic gearbox. If you went to Volkswagen with the same amount of money burning a hole in your pocket, they’d be able to sell you a basic-spec T-Cross with a five-speed manual. Despite the powerful engine, the Omoda 5 isn’t sporty to drive, or particularly satisfying. It’s quite quiet out on the road, but the soft suspension gets easily unsettled on poor road surfaces and the gearbox has a tendency to be dimwitted, especially around town. And what you save in purchase price, you’ll pay for at the pumps. Fuel economy from the Omoda 5 is very poor compared to most alternatives, and high CO2 emissions means it’s not going to make it on many company car lists. For a more appealing alternative here, you could try the all-electric Omoda E5 instead. If the allure of a powerful engine and loads of standard equipment for not much money gets you, then check out our best Omoda 5 deals here. You can check out our other favourite family cars and SUVs too, and remember Carwow can even help you sell your old car when the time comes. How much is the Omoda 5? How much is the Omoda 5? The Omoda 5 range kicks off at a little more than £25,000. That’s very competitive indeed - a Skoda Karoq starts at more than £28,000, or more than £40,000 if you want one with a similar level of power and equipment. In fact, the Omoda 5 starts at a couple of hundred pounds less than a basic Volkswagen T-Cross, which has far less equipment and exactly half the horsepower. If you want the better-equipped Noble variant of the Omoda 5, even that will only set you back £27,000. It's easy to see why the Omoda 5 could be a really compelling proposition, looking at the specs and equipment versus the cost. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort A powerful engine, but dimwitted gearbox and wallowy suspension spoil matters The Omoda 5 is a bit annoying to drive in town for a few reasons - but there are some positive points. Every model comes with a reversing camera, and top-spec Noble cars get a 360-degree surround-view monitor which even activates at junctions to help you avoid clipping kerbs. Noble models also get air purification in the climate control to help take those inner-city nasties out - a nice touch usually reserved for upmarket cars. However, the gearbox can be a pain. At junctions it can be hesitant, refusing to pull away without first girding its loins - and then it has the tendency to do so with rather more gusto than needed. All of this makes for jerky progress. It’s all too easy to accidentally select Manual mode on the gear lever, leaving you stuck in first gear until you realise and rectify this. The suspension is a bit wallowy, too. It’s soft enough to iron out bumps, but you soon notice that the car’s body keeps moving for a little bit after you’ve been over a big pothole or speed hump. This can be a bit nauseating. Visibility is also quite poor, especially for taller drivers whose heads will almost be touching the ceiling, meaning you have to lean forwards to get a good look at traffic lights. As for the rear-view mirror - it’s bizarre, being wide-angled enough to see not just the rear window but both front-seat passengers at the same time. It gives the sensation of looking down a tunnel and isn’t really very useful for judging distance. The Omoda’s 190hp engine is a boon on the motorway, especially when you compare it to the rather gutless SUVs you can usually buy at this price point. It makes short sliproads and overtaking much easier, and combined with the seven-speed gearbox which keeps revs low it’s quite relaxing. Wind, road and engine noise are well contained and the suspension is a bit less irritating on smoother roads - though if you hit a bump or a crest the car does still bob about for a while after. The Omoda has a full suite of assisted driving features, with adaptive cruise control standard on both models. These work fine, though even the closest following distance is rather hesitant. The lane-keeping aids are fairly unobtrusive though the obligatory driver attention monitor and speed limit assist are very irritating - and require quite a bit of searching through menus to turn off. Despite the powerful engine the Omoda is not a sporty SUV, and you’ll be able to show it a clean pair of heels in a similarly powerful Skoda Karoq or Nissan Qashqai as they’re just much more reassuring to drive. The Omoda’s steering is very remote, giving you no real idea what the front wheels are up to, and it leans a fair bit in bends too. Even in ‘Sport’ mode the gearbox can be hesitant, and there are no steering wheel-mounted paddles to take control yourself - you have to do that from the central selector, which isn’t particularly fun. Space and practicality Space and practicality A small boot and cramped rear seats, but storage spaces aren’t bad The Omoda’s front passengers sit in fairly comfortable seats, with the driver’s adjustable electrically as standard. Electric adjustment for the passenger seat comes with the Noble trim level. However, neither seat can be set low enough for even a moderately tall driver - our 6’2 tester’s hair was brushing the headlining, so if you’re taller than that you should definitely test-drive the Omoda before buying to check you fit. Storage space consists of a reasonable glovebox and door bins, a centre cubby and a pair of cupholders. There’s also a big space under the centre console suitable for things you want accessible but out of the way. And up top, you get a pair of spaces to store your phone, one of which is a wireless charger - though it’s a shame this is the one positioned furthest from the driver. Though the Omoda 5 isn’t a particularly small car, space in the rear is quite limited. Sat behind a six-foot driver, there’s limited legroom, and though the centre seat is flat and there isn’t too much of a hump in the floor the cabin is still a bit too narrow to accommodate three adults comfortably. The real issue is headroom, though, which is very poor. A six-foot adult will find their head brushing the roof, and the door line is quite a bit lower than the roofline so you really have to duck your head to get in or out. ISOFIX points are on both outer rear seats, but there’s not a lot of room for a bulky rear-facing car seat and the doors make getting one in quite tricky. With just a 380-litre boot on tap the Omoda 5 doesn’t offer much of a practicality boost over a standard family hatchback such as a Golf. Certainly all of its main SUV alternatives have more space on offer - the Citroen C5 Aircross has 580 litres, the MG HS has 507 litres, and even the dinky VW T-Cross has 385 litres of space. While the Omoda’s boot is quite long, it’s also shallow, and the rigid parcel shelf means you’ll have to remove it to carry larger items. There’s also nowhere to store it inside the car. The rear seats fold down easily, though you may need to remove the bulky headrests first to stop them fouling on the front seatbacks, and then they leave a reasonably flat load area for bigger items. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories Generally very posh-feeling for the money, but lacks the final polish The Omoda’s interior looks very premium when you first step in. The dashboard has two 10.3-inch screens across the top for driver information and infotainment, set under a single housing a lot like a Mercedes. The phone charging pads look very like what you get on a Tesla Model 3 , the climate controls look straight out of a Nissan Ariya and the gear selector has Audi written all over it. Not literally. So, like the exterior, it’s a bit of pastiche of lots of other cars. Some of Omoda’s design decisions are more successful than others. We like the minimalist centre console, the strip of climate controls separate from the touchscreen and the straightforward steering wheel and column stalk controls. Less good is the interesting pairing of matte chrome AND rose gold trim - pick one - the busy driver information display, and some of the more oddly-placed controls. The infotainment is a lot like the systems on other Chinese cars like BYD or MG - it’s clearly powerful, with a sharp, clear screen, but the menu system is a bit labyrinthine and based too much around tiny virtual buttons that are very hard to hit on the move. There are some clangers, too - if the system detects you’ve looked away from the road for too long, it flashes up a warning in the cluster saying ‘You have been distracted!’ - ironically very distracting in itself. Quality is a mixed bag, but you’d expect that in a car this price. Some of the plastics feel quite cheap and there are some really poor areas, like very ill-fitting floor mats, but most of what you touch feels posh and premium. It definitely appears to be much more expensive than its price tag, and compared to similarly priced cars from other brands it comes out rather well. MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax The Omoda’s 1.6-litre petrol engine is extremely thirsty compared to most alternatives. Omoda claims about 31mpg, though we got an average of 34mpg over a lot of mixed mileage. That’s really poor for a car of this size - any comparable SUV, even much larger ones, can get over 40mpg with their petrol engines. An equivalent VW T-Cross will get over 50mpg without much difficulty. That’s a difference of around £600 a year in fuel bills based on 10,000 miles - not insignificant. The Omoda’s tank is quite small, too, so you’ll struggle to get 400 miles from a fill necessitating lots of visits to petrol stations. With CO2 emissions of 170g/km, the Omoda falls into the most expensive band for company car Benefit-in-Kind tax , and attracts a beefy £680 first year’s tax bill. Safety and security Safety and security No arguing with Omoda here - the 5 achieved a full five-star Euro NCAP safety rating when it was tested for the European market back in 2022. Scores of 87% for both adult and child occupants are pretty good. The usual glut of standard safety systems are fitted - lane-keeping aids, adaptive cruise control and speed limit assist. These have to be turned on and off through quite a fiddly menu, while alternatives have shortcuts set up - a useful touch that we’d love Omoda to implement. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems It’s a bit early to say if Omoda will prove to be a reliable brand or not. Chinese brands have mixed reputations in the UK - MG, for example, came flat bottom in the 2024 Driver Power owner satisfaction survey . Omoda’s parent company, Chery, has never sold cars in the UK but is a vast brand globally, Omoda is offering its cars with a 7-year, 100,000 mile warranty - the equal of a Kia or MG - which should be reassuring."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/volkswagen/id7,Volkswagen ID.7 Review & Prices,"€66,763",8/10,new,"Is the Volkswagen ID7 a good car? Is the Volkswagen ID7 a good car? The fourth model in Volkswagen’s electric car line-up, the ID7 is a family saloon with a sporty design that should appeal to you if you haven’t succumbed to the SUV fever that has taken hold of buyers in the last decade or so. As a left-field alternative to the SUV, it’s a bit like sticking with skinny jeans when the on-trend fashionable types have moved on to baggier ones. First impressions are strong, with the long ID7 (it’s a shade under five metres from bumper to bumper) looking like a modern family car, with a swooping roof that makes it look slick and sporty. Inside, there’s plenty of space throughout, with a lot of legroom and headroom – despite the fact that the ID7 has the lowest roof of any of VW’s electric models. The boot has a 532-litre capacity, increasing to 1,586 litres if you lower the rear seats, so it should be enough for most family uses. If not, the more practical ID7 Tourer could be worth waiting for. Helping to make the cabin more airy is an optional full-length glass roof with smart glass, where the layers of glass in the sunroof can be electronically switched between opaque and clear, using a slider in the roof or voice control (which we’ll come to in a minute). Car manufacturers are very keen on introducing new technologies in their shiny, new zero-emissions vehicles: in this case, Volkswagen’s nifty innovation is an augmented-reality head-up display (HUD) , which comes as standard on all ID7s. The HUD is some pretty clever tech, but it’s also significant because it has a knock-on effect on the layout of the cockpit. The traditional instruments become smaller (because the driver won’t need to look at them as much) which is an innovation that works well, while Volkswagen has also given the infotainment system a more intuitive menu structure on its 15.0-inch touchscreen. Another way in which the ID7 hints at what will be the norm in future cars is the voice control feature. Voice controls aren’t new, by any means, but systems like the ID7’s are now more like the ones on smartphones, responding to commands or questions that are spoken more naturally. Whether that means it will interrupt the conversations between the driver and front-seat passenger (awkward!) remains to be seen. In the future, it'll even be integrated with AI functionality from ChatGPT. As the ID7 is a relatively large car, there’s plenty of room under the floor for a battery pack – and the first versions of the model to go on sale have a 77kWh battery. This bigger-than-average battery means that the ID7 has a range of up to 386 miles, with its 286hp motor enabling a respectable 6.5-second 0-62mph time. A version with an even larger battery will arrive later in 2024 with a range of about 430 miles – enough to drive from London to Edinburgh without stopping (theoretically, although your bladder might have something to say). The onboard charging system is pretty state of the art, too. You can charge an ID7 on one of those fancy (and expensive) ultra-rapid chargers at the motorway services, taking enough electricity in 10 minutes to cover 126 miles: you can also charge a battery at 10% up to 80% in 28 minutes. If all this sounds good, keep reading for our full take on the ID7. You can take a look at our latest VW ID7 deals here, or take a look at used examples of some of the other Volkswagen ID models , such as the ID4 and ID5 . Want to sell your car ? Well, Carwow can help with that, too. How much is the Volkswagen ID7? How much is the Volkswagen ID7? There's currently only one model of ID7 available. Named the Pro Launch Edition, it comes extremely well-equipped. On the outside there are 19-inch alloy wheels and LED lights all round, while inside you get heated and massaging seats, three-zone climate control, adaptive cruise control , and the 15.0-inch touchscreen loaded with features. At around £55,000 it's about £6,000 more expensive than a Long Range Tesla Model 3 , though it's a significantly larger car. It's close in size to the BMW i5, which it undercuts by around £20,000. There are a couple of options packs. The Exterior Pack adds LED Matrix headlights , privacy glass, and an electric hatchback, while the Exterior Pack Plus adds Dynamic Chassis Control (DCC) which includes adjustable suspension. The Interior Pack adds ventilation and more massage functions to the front seats, upgrades the sound system and brings more colours for the ambient lighting. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort Not too unwieldy around town and comfy on the motorway, but a Kia EV6 is more fun to drive The Volkswagen ID7 is a very long car, so you might think it’s going to be quite a challenge to drive around tight city centres. However, it’s really not too bad. Visibility at the front is good, with only moderate blind spots round the windscreen pillars, and a whole suite of electronic safety aids help you manoeuvre. A 360-degree camera system comes as standard, helping you thread your way through width restrictions or park without kerbing your alloys. It copes well with speed bumps, potholes and pockmarked surfaces, though it’s not as soft as a Nissan Ariya . And as the ID7 is a saloon car, rather than an SUV, you don’t get the high-set driving position and imperious view out over other traffic. The ID7 only has one level of regenerative braking - switched on by twisting the drive selector into ‘B’ mode. It’s quite strong, but it doesn’t go all the way down to a full stop like the Kia EV6 , so you can’t drive around town with just one pedal. The ID7 is extremely comfortable at a fast cruise - it’s very quiet and relaxing, with the slippery shape of the body meaning wind noise is minimal. It’s definitely as good as a Kia EV6 on the motorway, or even the much more expensive BMW i5 . The ID7 claims 386 miles of range according to official test procedures. Obviously you’ll get less than that at a constant 70mph, but 300 miles should still be achievable if you’re not too liberal with the accelerator. The standard electric motor produces 282hp, which is plenty, but many other EVs have a lot more power in reserve. A Kia EV6 or Hyundai Ioniq 5 feels easier to execute decisive overtakes with. Head out onto an undulating back road and the ID7 does its best to keep things neutral. You aren’t encouraged to carve up the corners, and the car’s safety systems step in before even very exuberant steering inputs result in things getting hairy. Opt for the more sophisticated Dynamic Chassis Control and you can adjust the suspension by 13 levels of firmness. At its softest it’s extremely pillowy - great for motorway cruises - but firm it up and the ID7 corners with almost no lean. A Kia EV6 or BYD Seal are still more rewarding than the ID7 on a fun road, thanks to steering that tells you a little more about what the front wheels are doing. But the ID7 doesn’t embarrass itself given its clear bias towards comfort. A high-performance ID7 GTX will join the range later in 2024, and will fill the niche of a sporty variant. Space and practicality Space and practicality A big boot and lots of legroom - but headroom could be better The ID7 has pretty sophisticated front seats. They’re certified by the German campaign for healthy backs (AGR) and are very adjustable - with four-way lumbar support and an extendable seat base to help support longer legs in addition to the usual fore/aft, backrest and seat height adjustments. They’re also heated, and come with a massage function as standard. Specify the Interior Pack and you get more choices of massage, as well as seat ventilation. Unlike many cars, you can have the seat heating and ventilation on at the same time - there’s even a function called ‘Dry Boost’ which is supposed to help if your clothes are slightly damp. Storage up front isn’t bad. The door bins are large, and felt-lined so that items you place in them won’t rattle. There’s also a large cubby under the central armrest, while the two hideaway covers in the centre console conceal a pair of cupholders, two USB-C ports and a wireless charging pad. The glovebox is quite small, though. There’s loads of room in the back of the ID7, especially legroom - even tall passengers can stretch out. There’s also enough space to slide your feet under the front seats, which isn’t always a given in an electric car where that space might be occupied by batteries. Headroom is not so generous, and anyone much over six feet tall might have to slouch a little bit to avoid their hair brushing the headlining. The outer two seats are quite sculpted, making the centre seat quite a narrow perch - the ID7 is better as a comfortable four-seater. There are two ISOFIX points on the rear bench, though loading a child seat isn’t quite as easy as it would be in an SUV with a higher roofline and larger doors. Boot capacity is a generous 532 litres with the rear seats in place. That’s bigger than a Kia EV6 (490 litres) or a Tesla Model 3 (425 litres). Plus, unlike the Tesla, the ID7 has a full-height hatchback boot instead of a narrow saloon opening, making it much easier to load bulky items in. Fold the rear seats down and there’s a 1,586-litre space. The rear seats split 60:40, and there’s a ski hatch in the middle to allow you to carry long, thin items between two rear passengers.There’s also an adjustable boot floor - in its higher position it leaves a totally flat floor when the seats are folded, but you can lower it for a little more height in the boot. Underneath, there’s a compartment ideal for storing charging cables, which is useful as the ID7 doesn’t have a front storage compartment (or ‘frunk’) like the Tesla Model 3 or BYD Seal do. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories New infotainment system is a huge improvement - shame the cabin environment is a bit dark and dingy The highlight of the Volkswagen ID7’s interior is its infotainment system . This new generation of touchscreen will be rolled out across Volkswagen’s whole ID range, and it’s been developed according to a lot of customer feedback. It uses a 15.0-inch screen, mounted high up on the dash. Underneath are some touch-sensitive buttons, which are now backlit so you can see what you’re doing at night. The software now operates a lot like a smartphone - there’s a configurable homepage with various widgets, and two rows of shortcut keys that can be swapped out to give you quicker access to the functions you most want to use. It is still firmly a touch-sensitive system, though - the only physical switchgear in the cabin, besides the column stalks, is the button for the hazard lights. While it’s not particularly difficult to adjust things like the climate control through the ID7’s touchscreen, it’s not as easy to do on the move as it would be with a discrete panel of switches. One or two functions, such as changing driving modes, require you to take your eyes off the road for just a little while too long for our liking. There is a fairly sophisticated voice assistant baked in, which doubles most functions of the infotainment system. You can even change the activation word to your own custom one - which is useful if you find yourself accidentally activating the system with the name of a family member. While the ID7’s touchscreen is a huge improvement over the existing system used on the ID3, ID4 and ID Buzz, it’s still not the best around. A Kia EV6 or Hyundai Ioniq 6 use more straightforward software, backed up by physical switches for the climate control. Meanwhile, a Tesla Model 3 has a more natural-feeling touchscreen interface, though it goes a step further with the headlights, wipers and even the drive selector on-screen. The massive central touchscreen is complimented by a narrow driver information display behind the wheel. This just shows the very basics of speed, range and warnings, while other functions such as giving navigation directions are handed off to the head-up display. Material and build quality throughout the cabin is good. The dashboard is covered in soft-touch plastic and leather, and you don’t find many hard, scratchy materials until you’re well away from the main touch points. The exception is the cupholders in the centre console, which are sharp-edged and feel quite cheap. Electric range, charging and tax Electric range, charging and tax Officially the VW ID7 will do 386 miles of range on a full charge of its 77kWh battery. That’s a very competitive number - it’s far higher than the best Kia EV6 (328 miles) and almost as good as the Tesla Model 3 Long Range, which claims 390 miles on a full charge. In terms of mileage for the money, it’s one of the best ratios on sale - if you want more range from an electric car at the moment you need to opt for a much more expensive model from the Mercedes model line-up. We’d estimate a real-world 300 miles is quite easily achievable, provided you’re not too liberal with the accelerator. Driven carefully around town, expect to come closer to that WLTP figure. One thing to note, though, is that a heat pump - which makes the heating system much more efficient in the winter - is an optional extra. Without it, your range in cold weather is likely to suffer a fair bit. Given a sufficiently powerful DC charger, the ID7 will top up its batteries at an impressive rate of 175kW. That means (in theory) a 10-80% charge will take just 28 minutes, which is in line with most rivals, even those with smaller batteries. Home charging will take eight hours for a 0-100% charge from an 11kW supply, or closer to 11 hours from a more common 7.4kW supply. A version with an even larger 86kWh battery will join the ID7 range later in 2024. This should achieve around 430 miles on the WLTP cycle. Conversely, a high-performance GTX model with four-wheel drive will see some range traded for poorer performance. With its electric powertrain and a relatively modest list price compared to most EVs of similar size and performance, the ID7 makes an enticing proposition as a company car. It’s also exempt from road tax and London’s congestion charge, at the moment, so it could easily save you some serious cash if you live around the capital. Safety and security Safety and security When tested by Euro NCAP , the ID7 scored a full five star safety rating, with particularly impressive scores in the adult occupant protection category. There’s a ton of safety equipment included as standard - not only do you get the mandated autonomous emergency braking, traffic sign assist and speed limit alerts, but you get a full 360-degree camera system, adaptive cruise control, automatic parking assistance, and Matrix LED headlights. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems The ID range of Volkswagens has proved fairly mechanically sound - electric cars often are - but software gremlins plagued the infotainment system and attracted several complaints. It’s far too early to know whether the ID7 will be similarly afflicted, however. Like all VWs, the ID7 comes with a fairly ungenerous three-year/60,000 mile warranty that pales in comparison to Kia’s seven-year offering, or the four-year/unlimited mile warranty on a Tesla Model 3. The battery is covered for eight years or 100,000 miles, which is in line with the vast majority of competitors."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/volkswagen/tayron,Volkswagen Tayron Review & Prices,"€52,849",9/10,new,"Is the Volkswagen Tayron a good car? Is the Volkswagen Tayron a good car? Much like Alan Partridge’s beloved extender dining table, the Volkswagen has hit its venerable Tiguan with the practicality stick, bestowing it with a bit more length to create the Tayron. The Tayron’s size puts it directly on par with the mechanically similar Skoda Kodiaq for practicality, but its posh interior and fancier design - especially on top-spec R-Line models - makes it a viable alternative to more premium cars such as the BMW X1 and Volvo XC40 . While the Volkswagen badge might not be quite as posh as brands such as Audi or Mercedes , at a first glance at least, the Tayron can certainly hold its own in terms of exterior design. The flat bonnet, tall roofline, boxy wheel arches and butch front end give the big Volkswagen buckets of road presence. There’s a similar story inside, where some minor changes compared to the Tiguan give the Tayron a much more upmarket feel. The dashboard is broken up by a big trim piece which swoops up around the vents at either end, and there are some snazzy ambient lights set into the dashboard and door trims. A 12.9-inch touchscreen infotainment system is standard with a 15.0-inch unit available on higher-spec models, but they’re both crisp and easy to read, as is the 10.3-inch driver display. The rotary knob in the middle of the centre console is rather less so, and it can be fiddly trying to select its individual menus. What isn’t fiddly, however, is finding the right driving position or somewhere to store your tat. The Tayron has comfortable seating all round, even in the third row, with lots of storage space in the front and loads of legroom in the middle row. The sliding bench helps when getting passengers in the rearmost seats. An enormous 885-litre boot (850-litres in seven-seater models) allows the Tayron to swallow up pretty much all the luggage you can throw at it. Naturally, boot space is limited with the rear seats up, but even then you’ve got as much load capacity as in a small hatchback . And the piece de resistance is that the Tayron is a bona fide seven-seater . Even with six-foot tall passengers in the second row there’s enough space for a similarly sized adult in the back, if only for short trips, and the wide cabin means you can fit three across the middle in relative comfort. You can have a Tayron with a multitude of engine choices, from a 1.5-litre mild-hybrid petrol engine to a 2.0-litre diesel , with a range of plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) and petrol engines in between. The entry level 1.5-litre engine is plenty to haul the Tayron about with little fuss, though it can sound a little strained getting up to motorway speeds. One of the 2.0-litre options will feel more effortless if you regularly carry a full car of passengers. Despite its heft and enormous footprint, the Tayron is surprisingly easy to drive around town. The steering is light without feeling vague, while big mirrors, a flat bonnet and a high seating position mean the big Volkswagen is easy to place on the road. R-line models do feel a bit stiff over broken road surfaces, though big bumps are well absorbed. Motorways are comfortable too, with a well-insulated engine keeping vibrations at bay and little in the way of wind noise, and while it’s not all that fun to drive the Tayron feels mostly grippy and planted on a country lane. As a big, practical, posh SUV the big Volkswagen makes an excellent choice of family car, and you can check out the latest Tayron deals here on Carwow, or Tayron lease deals instead. Alternatively, have a look at used Tayron deals through our network of trusted dealers, or other used Volkswagens if you don’t need all that junk in your car’s trunk. Carwow can even help you sell your car when the time comes. How much does the Volkswagen Tayron cost? How much does the Volkswagen Tayron cost? The Tayron range kicks off with the entry-level Tayron Life, which comes in at slightly more than the seven-seater Skoda Kodiaq and Peugeot 5008 , but it’s far less expensive than the equally upmarket Hyundai Santa Fe . Life models come as standard with 18-inch wheels, LED headlights and taillights, a 12.9-inch infotainment screen and customisable interior lighting. R-Line Edition spec is the most expensive trim level as standard, though it’s only available with a choice of 1.5-litre petrol engines. The real range topper is the R-Line trim with the 2.0-litre TSI petrol engine, offering the most performance, four-wheel drive, 20-inch wheels and a sporty body kit - though it is rather dear. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort Refined and easy to drive, though high-spec models could be more comfortable The Tayron is much easier to drive around town than you might expect from a big seven-seater SUV , thanks in part to its light steering, great all-round visibility and large mirrors. Even entry-level cars come fitted with all-round parking sensors and a rear-view camera, which combined with the large mirrors make it easy to fit into tight spaces. Big dips, bumps and potholes don’t faze the big SUV at all, but bigger-wheeled models don’t absorb broken, cracked road imperfections all that well, and you hear it through the cabin, but that’s the price to pay for a set of posh 20-inch alloys. Tayrons equipped with the 1.5-litre engine are surprisingly peppy, and while progress can hardly be described as rapid, they come to a motorway cruise without much fuss. There’s a little bit of engine noise that makes its way into the cabin when accelerating, but it pretty much disappears once you settle into a cruise. The stiffer edge to the Tayron’s suspension presents itself again at speed, because while it’s perfectly comfortable and adept on a smooth run, cats-eyes and ruts across the road do make themselves known with an audible ‘thump’ in R-Line models. Volkswagen’s active cruise control and lane-keep assist is one of the best in the business, taking the strain out of long drives without that lingering paranoia that you’ll have to jump in at any time or that you’re too close to the lorry next lane over. It may not be much fun, but the Tayron does a good job of making country lanes easy to drive through. It’s grippy, with little in the way of body lean for such a big car, and the steering manages to give you half a sense of what the front wheels are doing. It’s still a big beast at the end of the day, and the weight is most noticeable when you hit a bump mid-corner, as there’s a slight shimmy from the rear end which can feel slightly unnerving if you’re not expecting it. That being said, the Tayron makes no false promises about being sporty, so it’s a forgivable offence. Space and practicality Space and practicality Lots of room and usable third-row seating, but there are one or two annoyances There’s loads of room in the front of the Tayron, with miles of headroom - even for tall drivers - and plenty of adjustment in the seats and steering wheel to find a comfortable driving position. The seats are highly supportive, especially the semi-bucket items in R-Line models, and the suede trim is nice to the touch. There are ISOFIX mounting points in the passenger seat, too. A decently-sized centre console cubby, large glovebox and felt-lined door bins mean there’s plenty of space to keep your odds and sods in. The two-tiered wireless phone holder and cubby ‘shelf’ combo is handy too, as it means you don’t have to put your phone in the cup holder or lose centre console space for small items. That being said, the fact that it hides your phone out of sight makes it easy to forget it in the car if you’re rushing. The back of the Tayron is capacious, with loads of leg room - adjustable thanks to the sliding bench - and even more headroom than you’ll find in the already generous Tiguan thanks to a taller roofline. You can even fit three adults in the back in relative comfort, though the middle seat is slightly narrower than the outer pair. The middle row of seats can be reclined and even heated in the right spec; back seat passengers will have just as pleasant a time on a long drive as those in the front, especially given the Tayron’s large windows. Naturally, the middle row folds forwards for access to the third row on seven-seater models, and access is fairly good, even for adults over six feet tall. Third row passengers get a single cupholder and a small amount of storage, so it’s rock-paper-scissors for who gets to use it, and there aren’t any chargers or air vents back there either. PHEV Tayrons lose the third row of seats altogether to make space for the battery packs. You can even get four six-footers across both rear rows of a Tayron, though that’s really pushing it on particularly long journeys. Five-seater PHEV models have a 705-litre boot, and while that’s still a large load space it’s massively down on the seven-seater Tayrons with their enormous 850-litre capacity once the rear seats are stowed away. That’s five litres bigger than the Skoda Kodiaq (845 litres), though not quite as big as the Peugeot 5008 (916-litres). With the third row up, the Tayron has 345 litres of storage capacity in the back, putting it roughly on par with the 5008’s 348 litres and the Kodiaq’s 340 litres. A Volkswagen Polo has a 351-litre boot, to give you some idea of how big that is. Plenty of room for a few small suitcases. There are some useful touches such as fairly deep under-floor storage with a built-in slot for the rolled-up parcel shelf, but the floor itself is a bit annoying to slot in and the parcel shelf is finicky to remove. There are a useful pair of handles at the back to fold the middle-row seats down, but they feel awfully flimsy and you can see the trim panels either side of the boot flex before the seats drop down. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories A surprisingly upmarket interior with slick infotainment, but the trim options aren’t very interesting While its Tiguan roots are clear, the changes that Volkswagen has made to create the Tayron’s cabin have genuinely elevated it to another level of poshness. The upright, gloss black dashboard is underlined by a contrasting trim piece which kinks up at the edges around the set-back air vents. It’s a simple piece of design, as is the contrasting strip below it which wraps around onto the door cards, but it’s hugely effective at giving the Tayron’s cabin a luxurious vibe. You can even get it in a snazzy wood finish. The gloss black dashboard and door card surfaces are home to LED ambient light patterns, with customisable colour options and some preset ‘moods’ to choose from. They seem a little gimmicky at a first glance, but they do look pretty when you’re driving at night. Volkswagen's infotainment system is the slickest it’s ever been, whether in 12.9-inch or 15.0-inch guise in the Tayron, and while the touchscreen climate control menu can be annoying to use on the move - as are the temperature sliders - you get used to them fairly quickly. The rotary volume knob on the centre console is a good addition, but the integrated touch-screen menu inside it is unintuitive to use and it’s set a little far back. MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax You’ll find an impressively wide variety of engine options available on the Tayron, with multiple 1.5-litre and 2.0-litre options including pure petrol, mild hybrids and even a diesel. A refreshing change given the trend of super-slimmed down engine ranges these days. Both 1.5-litre plug-in hybrid options have a claimed electric range of 72-73 miles and just 10g/km of CO2 emissions. You’ll be hard pressed to see more than 60 miles of electric range though, given our experience with the hybrid system in other cars. The mild hybrid version has a claimed average fuel efficiency of 45.2mpg and emits 142g/km of CO2. Our mild hybrid test car saw an average of 42mpg over mixed motorway and city mileage, not miles behind Volkswagen’s claim. The 2.0-litre petrol comes with four-wheel drive and can be had with 204hp or 265hp. Fuel economy suffers as a result, down to the 33-36mpg range, but you do get a noticeable performance boost over the smaller engine models. The diesel is the choice for motorway mile munching enthusiasts, with the best fuel economy at 49.5mpg. All Tayrons are subject to the Expensive Car Supplement on years two to six, with a range of first-year tax prices from £110 to £3,300 depending on the engine you choose. Company car drivers will only have to pay the third lowest band of Benefit in Kind tax on a plug-in model though. Safety and security Safety and security The Tayron was awarded a five-star rating by Euro NCAP in 2025, with an impressive 87% adult occupant score and an 85% child occupant score. Its sister car, the Tiguan, also scored five stars. All Tayrons come as standard with a suite of driver assistance technologies including adaptive cruise control, driver attention monitoring, emergency autonomous braking, lane assist and even a system that will notice an oncoming car around a corner and help you swerve to avoid it. There are a trio of ISOFIX anchor points, two in the middle row and one in the front, though it’s a shame there aren’t any in the third row. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems The Tayron is too new for any mechanical issues to have come to light yet, as is its Tiguan stablemate. Volkswagen came a poor 29th out of 32 manufacturers in the 2024 Driver Power Reliability survey, which isn’t a confidence inspiring result. The Tayron’s warranty is nothing special, with a standard three-year/60,000 mile warranty as is standard with most European cars - and there’s no option to extend.

https://www.carwow.co.uk/volkswagen/id4,Volkswagen ID.4 Review & Prices,"€54,875",7/10,new,"Is the Volkswagen ID4 a good car? Is the Volkswagen ID4 a good car? You love SUVs and more and more of you are loving electric cars, that makes the new Volkswagen ID4 electric SUV a case of possibly the right product at the right time. Although, with some impressive alternatives like the Tesla Model Y and Nissan Ariya also joining the fray, it doesn’t quite have things all its own way. The VW ID4 is about the same size as the company’s Tiguan SUV and should be just as practical – but a bit more futuristic-looking. If you and your sibling are the VW Golf and Tiguan, then the ID3 and ID4 are a bit like your posh cousins who always have the latest fashion and tech. You get a number of engine and battery options, with power outputs spanning 146hp to 295hp, and ranges starting at 213 miles and going up to 328 miles. Rear-wheel-drive is standard with top specs getting all-wheel-drive. The ID4 is supposed to follow the look of the ID3 and like that car, it has slim LED headlights connected by a full-width LED light bar, while a large intake sits low on the bumper. You’ll spot that there’s no grille (electric cars don’t need them because they don’t have a hot engine to cool). Range: 317-337 miles Efficiency: 3.9-4.1 miles per kWh Battery size: 77kWh Max charge speed: 135kW / 175kW Charge time AC: 12hrs 40mins, 0-100% at 7kW Charge time DC: 28 mins, 10-80% at 135kW / 28 mins, 0-80% at 175kW Charge port location: Right rear Power outputs: 282hp / 335hp And that’s about it for the front-end highlights. At the back, a wide lightbar mimics the similar element of the front of the car. But with a high bonnet and bulbous back end, the ID4 is a bit blobby and heavy-looking. It has a simpler design inside, though. For a start, there’s no gear lever — rather, you simply twist a large knob behind the steering wheel, similar to that on a BMW i3 . However, the wheel obscures the switch, so you have to crane around the rim to see it. Speaking of that driver’s display, it gives you key information, such as speed and charge status, on a sharp display. For other functions, there’s a 10.0-inch infotainment system, or 12.0-inch on top trims. There are comparatively few buttons, because most functions are operated through the central screen. You can also use your voice to control the infotainment settings on the move, although as with many systems of this kind it can be glitchy. Interior quality isn’t great either – there are some scratchy plastics – but at least the ID4 is comfortable. There’s lots of adjustment for the driver’s seat and steering wheel so you should be able to find a good driving position. And there’s loads of space in the rear seat, so passengers in the back should be comfy too – even in the middle seat. As for boot space, the Volkswagen ID4 offers 543 litres — ever so slightly more than the 510 litres in the BMW iX3 ’s boot. To keep with the Volkswagen Tiguan comparison, the ID4 doesn’t quite match its 615 litres, but given the size of the batteries underneath the floor in the ID4 it’s a fair effort.

We also have a number of used Volkswagen ID4s available at carwow, while you can look at other new Volkswagen deals through carwow as well.

How much is the Volkswagen ID4? The base VW ID4 Life trim equipped with the smallest battery pack offers decent value amongst other electric SUVs, offering less power and range than a base Kia EV6 or Hyundai Ioniq 5 , but also undercutting them in pricing. The higher spec VW ID4 models with the larger 77kWh battery packs are more direct alternatives to the Hyundai Ioniq 5, Kia EV6 and the Nissan Ariya. The top GTX Max trim is comparable in spec and pricing to a Ford Mustang Mach-E and Tesla Model 3 , but falls a bit short in range and performance. This makes a mid-spec ID4 the most logical choice, preferably in Style trim and equipped with the larger 77kWh battery pack. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort The VW ID4 is quiet and refined at all speeds and has a sharp turning circle. Base models aren’t particularly rapid though, and the ride can be a bit too firm on larger wheels The VW ID4 offers the usual EV benefits of smooth power delivery and brisk off-the-line performance allied with the SUV bonuses of a raised driving position and good visibility. It’s got a tight turning circle, too, making it great for town driving. The regenerative braking is progressive, making it easier to judge if and when you need to apply the brakes at slower speeds. The view out the rear is slightly impeded by the large pillars either side of the rear window, but even the base Pure trim comes with front and rear parking sensors, rearview camera and park assistance plus as standard. To further aid you during your commute, oncoming vehicle brake assist and dynamic road sign display are also included across all trims. The ride quality is on the firm side so we’d avoid the sportier 20-inch wheels if that’s a deal-breaker for you. At motorway speeds the cabin is impressively refined, with wind, tyre and road noise well contained. The lower powered models don’t feel especially quick but won’t have you rocking back and forth in your seat as you attempt an overtake either. The ID4 is designed more as a cruiser than a sport EV anyway, and it excels in this role. You get adaptive cruise control, lane assist and a driver fatigue alert as standard on all models. The ID4 is firmly sprung and doesn’t lean too much in the corners, and grip levels out of tight corners are good too, especially in the sporty GTX and more powerful all-wheel-drive models. What the VW ID4 doesn’t do is provide an entertaining drive. It’s great at its intended role as a family-friendly electric SUV, but the BMW iX3 and Ford Mustang Mach-e are far better at putting a smile on your face down a back road. Space and practicality Space and practicality The cabin offers loads of room four or even five adults at a push. You also get plenty of storage space front and rear, although some alternatives have even more space in the back It’s not the largest SUV in its class, yet the ID4 makes the most of its interior space with enough head and legroom in the front for all shapes and sizes, and the steering wheel and driver’s seat offer plenty of adjustment to help you find the perfect driving position. Storage space has been well thought out too. The centre console contains two cupholders which can be removed to create a large storage bin, and between the front seats is another storage bin with a retractable cover with a wireless charging pad and USB-C slots inside it. A pair of large door bins will take big bottles without issue and the front passenger seat comes with ISOFIX mountings if you want your toddler riding shotgun. The ID4 offers a generously-sized back row, and two adults will fit quite comfortably even on longer trips. The middle seat is easily accessible thanks to a lack of a hump in the floor, and while it will fit another adult, shoulder room will be at a premium. Alternatives like the Hyundai Ioniq 5 have even more rear legroom and partially reclinable rear backrests, but the ID4 should be spacious enough for most families. ISOFIX mountings are provided in the outer two seats, and you get two large door pockets, front seatback pockets and the obligatory set of cupholders in the foldable centre armrest. Two USB-C slots and two air vents are situated low down by the feet of the middle passenger. There’s a total of 543 litres of space in the boot, this is better than what you get in a BMW iX3 (510 litres) as well as the Kia EV6 (466 litres), but not quite as good as the 615 litres of the petrol-powered Tiguan . The boot offers a few hooks and straps to help secure your luggage, as well as a 12-volt socket and a small compartment under the boot floor for the charging cables. An adjustable boot floor is offered on certain trims, and the load space increases to an impressive 1,655 litres with the rear seats down although there is a pronounced step in the boot floor and there’s a bit of a load lip to deal with when packing in heavy items. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories There’s enough tech in here to keep your inner geek satisfied, although the quality of the interior lags behind some alternatives There’s nothing wrong with the way the interior of the ID4 has been put together, but some trim and material choices aren’t quite as good as you’d expect in a car at this price level. The overall design follows the minimalist approach adopted by most manufacturers for their electric cars, with a bare minimum of physical buttons and a large infotainment screen pasted onto the dashboard. A 10.0-inch version is standard on the Life and Style trims, with the GTX versions getting a slightly larger 12.0-inch unit. There’s no difference in features, with both getting Apple CarPlay and Android Auto as standard as well as sat nav and DAB radio. The icons and layout look sharp, but it can be a bit slow to respond to instructions and the voice control is a bit patchy sometimes. The steering wheel controls are also a bit frustrating to use, they’re touch-sensitive and respond differently depending on whether they’re pressed or swiped. This can be difficult to get right while on the move, just like the finicky touch-sensitive controls under the screen for the fan and temperature adjustment. It all works fine once you account for these idiosyncracies, but a Tesla Model 3 and BMW iX3 have far slicker setups. You get plenty of kit for your money though, with a digital driver display, LED headlights, heated seats and adaptive cruise control fitted even on the base trim. Mid-spec Style trims get keyless access and a panoramic sunroof which greatly enhances the feel of the cabin, while GTX models get the larger infotainment unit and a head-up display. Electric range, charging and tax Electric range, charging and tax The Volkswagen ID4 can be had with either a 52kWh or 77kWh battery, and power outputs range from 146hp to 295hp with ranges from 220 miles to 328 miles. The various combinations are called Pure, Pro, Pro Performance, Pro Performance 4MOTION and GTX. The Pure option comes with 146hp and a 52kWh battery pack, it will do up to 213 miles on a charge. A 0-62mph time of 10.9-seconds lags behind most other small electric SUV alternatives. Pure Performance versions get the same battery but 168hp, this cuts the 0-62mph time down to 9.0 seconds without affecting the range. Charging from 0-100% will take seven and a half hours using a 7.4kW home wall box, and if you can find a 110kW public charger it will take just 38 minutes to get from 0% to 80%. Pro models get a larger 77kWh battery and 171hp, which pushes the range up to 328 miles. Pro Performance versions get 201hp with the same battery pack, getting you from 0-62mph in 8.5 seconds while the range remains unchanged. With a 7.4kw wall box it will take 12 hours to get you from zero to fully charged. These two combinations offer the longest range for the ID4. Both Life Edition and Style Edition trims can be had with any of these power options, however, the Life Edition trim is also available with the Pro Performance 4MOTION combo which uses the same 77kWh battery but adds an additional electric motor to the front axle making it all-wheel drive and boosting power to 261hp. Acceleration is markedly better with a 6.9-second 0-62mph time, and the range drops slightly to 317 miles. The range-topping GTX and GTX Max trims use the same 77kWh battery but get another power boost, this time to 295hp and manage up to 308 miles on a charge. The all-wheel-drive setup helps them launch from 0-62mph in 6.2 seconds, slightly quicker than the BMW iX3, but no match for the Tesla Model Y (4.8 seconds) or 325hp Hyundai Ioniq 5 (5.1 seconds). In terms of range, the smaller 52kWh battery pack offers slightly less range than what you get out of a Nissan Ariya with a 63kWh battery. 77kWh ID4 equipped cars are comparable to the Tesla Model 3 and go further than a BMW iX3. The VW ID4 does not incur any road tax and is also exempt from all ULEZ and congestion charges. Safety and security Safety and security The ID4 received a full five-star rating in the more stringent 2021 Euro NCAP rating system, and performed particularly very well in the adult occupant (93%) and safety assist (85%) categories. Standard passive and safety equipment includes adaptive cruise control, front and rear parking sensors, rearview camera and park assistance plus as standard. Autonomous emergency braking for pedestrians and cyclists and a proactive passenger protection system are also part of the standard package. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems The Volkswagen ID4 is a relatively new model and as such has not built up much of a history regarding reliability, however, recent reliability surveys have placed Volkswagen as a brand in the lower third of auto manufacturers. Hopefully, the lower complexity of the ID4 EV will see it perform better than this in the years to come. A standard three-year/60,000-mile warranty is pretty average fare, as is the eight-year/100,000-mile battery pack warranty. Many alternatives offer unlimited mileage as part of their standard warranties, with Kia leading the pack with its seven-year/100,000-mile offering. Volkswagen ID4 FAQs Volkswagen ID4 FAQs"
https://www.carwow.co.uk/volkswagen/golf-gti,Volkswagen Golf GTI Review & Prices,"€49,193",7/10,new,"Is the Volkswagen Golf GTI a good car? Is the Volkswagen Golf GTI a good car? A staple in the world of the hot hatchback , the venerable Volkswagen Golf GTI was one of the first of the breed - and one of the best too. It’s been a shining example of a car that can do it all for decades, blending every day sensibility with usable performance in a sporty package. Think of the Golf GTI as a husky in sheep’s clothing, rather than a wolf. It looks unassuming to most people, but when you engage the Golf’s sporty driving modes and point it at a nice road it’ll chase down more powerful cars without ever feeling scary. The game has moved on though, and the Golf GTI has some serious hot hatchback competition these days. From the hardcore Honda Civic Type R and pocket rocket Toyota GR Yaris to the uber rapid - but uber expensive - Audi RS3 and Mercedes A35 , the Golf GTI seems a little…mild. Even its own Golf R sibling has the GTI licked for outright pace and cornering grip. A 2024 update came to the Golf GTI’s rescue though, bringing with it the introduction of the latest GTI Clubsport model - which sits above the regular GTI with more power, sportier driving modes and dartier steering. It feels like what the Golf GTI should have been all along, but we’ll come back to that. The update saw the GTI gain some sportier bodywork and posher lights, though the illuminated badge is something the Golf could have done without; a bit chintzy for an otherwise classy car. It’s a handsome thing, if not exciting, but it does look purposeful in an ‘if you know you know’ kinda way. Inside is a similar story, with the classy, high-quality Golf interior spruced up just a touch with splashes of red trim, red ambient lighting and a GTI-specific steering wheel. While the current generation of Golf was launched in 2020 with one of the worst infotainment systems we’ve seen in recent years, the updated system is a comparative joy to use. Dashboard shortcut buttons would still be appreciated, but Volkswagen ditching the infuriating touch-sensitive steering wheel controls is a huge win. There’s good space in the cabin and the seats are supportive, though rear legroom can be a little tight for tall passengers; fixed front headrests can induce neck ache for short passengers on long drives too. The 374-litre boot is smaller than some alternatives but it’s a useful shape and plenty big enough for four hand-luggage sized suitcases. As has been the way with Golf GTIs for decades, it’s one of the most refined hot hatchbacks you can buy. It’s comfortable around town, even in Clubsport trim, and while it’s notably stiffer than a regular Golf over bumps you’re rarely ever left wincing through potholes. Motorways are fantastic in the GTI with little in the way of wind noise and well-behaved driver assistance systems. Road noise is a bit too loud in the Clubsport though, especially over rougher motorway sections, though it’s never unbearable. B-roads should be where the GTI feels most at home, but sadly Volkswagen’s engineers have been a little too sensible when setting up the hot hatch. It’s never unsettled by bumpy corners and it feels fairly agile, but it’s just a little… numb. The Clubsport, again, remedies that to a certain extent. It’s much more direct than the standard car, with the wheels eagerly following your steering input and the car rotating well when carving through corners. It just feels a bit more old-school, and fun as a result, but while it’s a big improvement on the GTI it’s still some way off the Civic Type R. As a comfortable all rounder the GTI is a solid choice, so you should have a look at the latest Volkswagen Golf GTI deals on Carwow to get a great price on one. Check out Golf GTI lease deals for a different route to getting into one, or browse used Golf GTIs from our trusted network of dealers. There are other used Volkswagen models available, and Carwow can help when it’s time to sell your car too. How much is the Volkswagen Golf GTI? How much is the Volkswagen Golf GTI? The Volkswagen Golf GTI represents decent value compared with other hot hatches – though it’s a touch more expensive than the Ford Focus ST it’s also a bit cheaper than performance-focused versions of the Cupra Leon . The Honda Civic Type R is considerably more, but it’s pretty much the best hot hatchback you can buy at the minute. The GTI Clubsport is a couple thousand pounds more than the basic GTI, and it’s worth every penny. More power, more performance and sportier looks mean the Clubsport feels like a proper hot hatch It’s the sweet spot of the range, but should you need more outright pace the Golf R is a couple thousand on top again. It's a different beast altogether with even more power and all-wheel drive though, so not exactly comparable. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort The Volkswagen Golf GTI is comfortable and relaxing to drive most of the time, with a hint of sportiness when you want it – but alternatives are much more fun to drive The awkward truth about buying a performance car is that the vast majority of the time you won’t be driving it at the limit of grip on an epic country road, but instead cruising around town. On the standard suspension the Golf GTI is comfortable enough, but you can pay a bit extra for an adaptive system – do so, and the comfort setting makes it handle bumps just about as well as a regular Golf. The steering is responsive and the car has a relatively small turning circle, which helps get around tight bends and mini roundabouts in town. You can’t get a Golf GTI with a manual gearbox anymore, but that’s fine in town because the auto is smooth to shift gears and takes the pain out of stop-start traffic. The Volkswagen Golf GTI is just as impressive on the motorway or A roads as it is around town. Commuting isn’t an issue because it has a lot of the characteristics of a ‘normal’ car – namely the way it smooths out bumps in the road and cocoons you from too much tyre and wind noise. Cruising along motorways is easy in the GTI, but then so is overtaking, with loads of power available throughout the rev range. The performance also means that getting up to motorway speed on a slip road, or pulling off a quick overtake, is no bother. The GTI comes with adaptive cruise control as standard, which prevents the car from getting too close to the one in front. Lane assist can also nudge the wheel to stop you drifting out of your lane, while the cruise control also works in stop-start traffic so you don’t need to keep working the pedals in a jam. With plenty of grip and willingness from the engine, the latest Volkswagen Golf GTI is technically the best yet. However, when concentrating on high-end precision and the feel of the steering, brake pedal and gearbox, it’s not quite a match for the Honda Civic Type R. Okay, that car is much more expensive, but the same can be said of more affordable hot hatches such as the Ford Focus ST and Hyundai i30 N (though the latter is now only available on the used market). Step up to the Clubsport model and the GTI levels up its performance game significantly. It’s got around 30hp more than the regular car and more direct steering as well as sportier suspension settings. It’s still no hardcore hot-hatch, but it’s actually quite fun to carve through corners on a twisty road. Many alternatives still have manual gearbox options, but the Golf GTI being auto-only isn’t the end of the world because it suits its character. While it is good fun to drive, it’s not trying to be too serious a driver’s car like the Honda. Space and practicality Space and practicality Spacious enough for most in the cabin, but the boot is smaller than alternatives can offer The interior of the Volkswagen Golf is more high-tech than ever, but thankfully, useful storage spaces haven’t suffered as a consequence. There are large door bins that are felt-lined to help sound insulation as well as adding to the quality levels all round. Other elements that have been carried over from the previous GTI include the central armrest with integrated storage underneath, and cup holders that can hold bottles big and small. There is decent headroom in the back of the Golf GTI, though legroom might be a bit of a squeeze if your passengers are particularly tall. There’s just about room for three if your passengers don’t mind getting cozy. One slight annoyance for rear passengers, however, might be the large sports seats in front, which tend to block the view out of the front window or into the front of the car. Fitting a child seat is easy enough, because the doors open nice and wide and the ISOFIX mounting points are clearly marked. Even bulky seats should have enough space without having to push the front seat forward. You get 374 litres of boot space in the Volkswagen Golf GTI, which is a few litres down on the regular Golf – though this is caused by the speaker system being fitted in the underfloor storage, so shouldn’t be a problem. You can still fit smaller items around the speaker though, handy when packing for a long trip. It’s ample for most situations, but those who want more room from their sporty hot hatch’s boot will need to go for the Skoda Octavia vRS , which has a whopping 600 litres on offer. The Honda Civic Type R also beats the Volkswagen with 410 litres, though the GTI’s boot isn’t much smaller than the Ford Focus ST (380 litres) and BMW M135i (380 litres). So it’s not the biggest boot going, but it’s a usefully square shape, so you can maximise what you do have. With the rear seats folded there’s no ridge, making it easy to slide heavy items through, while features such as hooks for shopping bags mean you won’t risk cracking your eggs on a spirited return from the local Tesco. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories Materials and build quality are excellent, and the updated infotainment is an improvement, but there are still some ergonomic annoyances There’s not a drastic uplift in the interior for the Volkswagen Golf GTI compared with regular models. There’s some neat red stitching, stainless steel pedals and GTI graphics on the screens, though it’s good enough not to need it. One of the more noticeable changes in the GTI is the addition of sports seats. They feature integrated headrests and plenty of side support to keep driver and passenger in place when putting the hot hatch through its paces. The seats also get tartan upholstery, which is a GTI hallmark, and front ISOFIX mounts mean you can keep an eye on your child when travelling with them alone. The infotainment system is also carried over largely unchanged from ‘normal’ Golfs, which means dual screens that display a vast array of information in good clarity. The software has been updated for 2024 models, which makes the 12.9-inch main display in particular much easier to use. Another great change is the removal of the rubbish touch-sensitive steering wheel buttons that have made their way across various Volkswagen Group models over the past few years. Customer feedback has thankfully been taken on board, so they’ve been switched for physical buttons that are much easier to use. That said, there’s still a touch-sensitive pad beneath the main screen for various shortcuts, including the drive mode selector, which isn’t quite as easy to use as it could be. MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax There’s just the one engine available in both the Volkswagen Golf GTI and GTI Clubsport. It’s a 2.0-litre turbocharged petrol engine that makes 265hp in the GTI (up 20hp on before) and 300hp in the GTI Clubsport (the same as the old one). Both send power to the front wheels through a seven-speed automatic gearbox. In testing we saw 0-60mph in 5.4 seconds in the GTI, which is a few tenths quicker than the official figures. Proving its daily driver credentials, official fuel economy figures are 39.8mpg in the GTI and 37.7 in the GTI Clubsport. Not bad for performance cars. However, both have quite high CO2 emissions, meaning they’re fairly expensive in first-year road tax , and you’d have to get a basic car with pretty much no options to avoid the surcharge in years two to six for cars that cost over £40,000. The emissions figures mean the Golf GTI isn’t a particularly affordable option for company car drivers , either. Safety and security Safety and security The Volkswagen Golf GTI hasn’t specifically been tested by safety experts Euro NCAP , but the wider Golf range received a maximum five-star score when it was evaluated in 2022. Its category scores were on a par with comparable models in the class – with adult (front) and children (rear) performance being particularly better than the Honda Civic. Euro NCAP testing has become stricter since 2022 though, which is worth considering if you value safety above all else. To match the performance offered by the GTI there are a wide range of safety systems fitted as standard to the hot hatch. For example, you get bigger brakes than the standard car as well as standard-fit adaptive cruise control, a system that can swerve to avoid head-on collisions, and an advanced driver drowsiness monitor. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems The GTI comes with Volkswagen’s three-year warranty, which covers drivers for up to 60,000 miles in total. Volkswagen has a mixed record in some reliability surveys, sometimes finishing in the lower half of the list of manufacturers. Volkswagen came a lowly 29th place out of 32 manufacturers in the 2024 Driver Power survey for downer satisfaction though, which is far from a confidence inspiring for prospective owners. In March 2022, there was a recall relating to engine cover installations on the Golf GTI and Golf R models. Apart from that the wider Golf range was called in for software- and infotainment-related issues in 2021."

Is the Volkswagen T-Roc Cabriolet a good car? Tastes change. Remember when everybody used to smoke? Not so much, these days. People used to exclusively buy family hatchbacks , too, but now the family SUV is in vogue. And now stepping on to the catwalk are open-top SUVs like the Volkswagen T-Roc Cabriolet. This look might take a little longer to hit the high streets, but it makes sense when you think about it. We used to happily buy open-top hatchbacks, so why not open-top SUVs? And as they go, the Volkswagen T-Roc Cabriolet isn’t half bad. It has a chunky, upright stance and clean lines roof up or down that’ll certainly turn heads. Inside you get the usual VW quality and straightforward logic in terms of design, plus its latest touchscreen infotainment systems. Like the standard T-Roc , the Cabriolet will seat five people, and with only two doors the space between its front and rear wheels has been extended to allow more room for those in. the back. However, at 284 litres its boot will be noticeably smaller than the standard car’s. Dropping the electrically operated roof takes 11 seconds. Only petrol engines are offered in the T-Roc Cabriolet – either a 110hp 1.0-litre three-cylinder or 150hp 1.5 four-cylinder, with the latter also having a choice between a six-speed manual or seven-speed automatic gearbox. There are just two trims to choose between too, either Style or R-Line, the former being cheaper and focused on comfort, the latter more expensive with a more aggressive, sporty look inside and out.

https://www.carwow.co.uk/volkswagen/golf-gte,Volkswagen Golf GTE Review & Prices,"€46,964",Not found,new,"Is the Volkswagen Golf GTE a good car? Is the Volkswagen Golf GTE a good car? The Volkswagen Golf GTE is the plant-based vegan burger menu option of the hot-hatch world. You know it’s better for you and the planet, and it’s pretty much as tasty and filling, but you’d (not so) secretly rather be having the meat-fest beef burger that is the Golf GTI . There is a pretty good argument that the Golf GTE is the best of all worlds, but up till now it’s been slightly too much of a compromise. The first generation version used a 13kWh battery giving it a theoretical 40 mile range on electric energy alone (and that was broadly a realistic enough figure — certainly, you’d have got 30 miles out of it). Combined with a 1.4-litre turbo petrol engine, that gave you 242hp and 0-62mph in 6.7secs. Not as fast as a GTI (blame the extra weight of the battery) but still brisk, and you could easily get it to average better than 60mpg with only a little bit of charging. Even so, the Golf GTE always felt second best to the petrol-only GTI. The weight didn’t help — sapping the acceleration as it did — and the extra ride height needed to make enough clearance underneath the car for the battery mean that while the GTE was fine to drive, it could never be as sharp and rewarding as the GTI. Now, though, there’s a major update for the GTE. Out goes the wheezy old 1.4 turbo and in comes a more modern, smoother, slicker 1.5-litre TSI turbo petrol engine. The electric motor has been beefed up too, so now the GTE develops 272hp, actually slightly more than the upgraded GTi manages. Crucially, the GTE’s battery is now much bigger than before — 19kWh — and VW claims that gives it an electric range of more than 62 miles. In fact, given that the bigger, heavier Volkswagen Tiguan e-Hybrid also squeezes 62 miles out of the same battery, the Golf GTE should go a bit further than that, and that dramatically changes its ability as a zero-emissions driving option. Fast-charging comes to the Golf GTE for the first time too, as you’ll be able to use 50kW DC public chargers to top up the battery in around 20 minutes — and cause apoplexy in every electric car driver for a 1,000 mile radius. The combo of ultra-low CO2 figures and long electric range could actually make the GTE a better choice for business user-choosers than the petrol-only GTI, even if the advantage in the tax returns is lost in the corners. Inside, the awkward, cheap-looking infotainment screen originally introduced in 2019 has been chucked out and replaced by a slick new free-standing unit that gets software which is far easier to find your way around. VW is even going to stick Chat GPT artificial intelligence software into the screen later in 2024, allowing the car the chat to you like a proper robot companion. The GTE also gets traditional tartan seat centres, but the colours have been changed to grey and white to make them look a little more tech-y. Just remember that the big battery costs you boot space — you can only pack 275-litres into the back of a Golf GTE. We'll have an in-depth Volkswagen Golf GTE ready to go once we've tested it out thoroughly, but if you're already convinced the Golf GTE should be your next car, have a look through our latest Volkswagen deals and used Volkswagen cars for sale . You can even sell your car online through Carwow. How much is the Volkswagen Golf GTE? How much is the Volkswagen Golf GTE? The Volkswagen Golf GTE costs around £1,000 more than the GTI, which may make it look like bad value compared to its more iconic brother. It’s not quite that simple, though. The GTI buyer will have to pay far more VED road tax — £680 plus, if you’ve spent extra on a couple of options, the £390 levy for spending more than £40,000. The GTE gets zero-rate VED road tax for now. In BIK terms, the GTI buyer will be spending three times as much per month in extra tax than the GTE driver — that’s a powerful incentive to switch to part-electric. Of course, you could go fully-electric. For around £5,000 less than the price of a Golf GTE, you could have the new MG 4 X-Power , with its 435hp, and 0-62mph in just 3.8secs. Of course, the MG’s cabin and quality aren’t anywhere near as good as the Golf’s, but never mind the quality, feel the speed. Standard Golf GTE equipment includes 17-inch alloy wheels, a 10.9-inch touchscreen, Matrix LED headlights, keyless entry, lane-keeping steering, and traffic jam assist, which keeps you creeping forward in heavy traffic without you having to worry about braking."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/volkswagen/touareg,Volkswagen Touareg Review & Prices,"€85,361",6/10,new,"Is the Volkswagen Touareg a good car? Is the Volkswagen Touareg a good car? The Volkswagen Touareg may not have quite the badge cachet of the Audi Q7 and Mercedes GLE , but nevertheless, it’s a big, spacious, high-tech SUV that’s also very comfortable. Think of the Touareg, then, as Waitrose rather than Harrods Food Hall. It’s easily posh enough for the majority of people, but might not be plush enough for those used to the finer things in life. Volkswagen gave the Touareg a little nip and tuck in 2023, which introduced a new-look grille at the front, updated bumpers and a full-width rear light bar (which includes a questionable illuminated VW badge). It’s not as instantly recognisable as a Porsche Cayenne , but it’s inoffensively handsome. It’s a bit more impressive inside, with the central touchscreen that blends into a 15.0-inch digital driver’s display. The central screen is larger than anything you’ll find in an Audi , BMW , Mercedes or maybe even your local Vue cinema, and controls almost all of the VW’s features – from the sat nav to the climate control. This is all standard on post-2023 models. It’s not just high-tech, because the Touareg comes with a slick, sweeping cabin design that looks suitably upmarket, but a few cheap-feeling materials do let the Volkswagen down a bit, such as on the centre console and lower surfaces of the dashboard. Overall it’s a very plush place to sit, but for the price the likes of BMW and Audi do it better. The VW Touareg’s excellent practicality means you might be able to forgive a few scratchy pieces of plastic, however. There’s ample space for very tall adults in both the front and rear seats, and – besides the rather shallow tray under the armrest – all its cubby holes and storage bins are pretty generous. The ISOFIX anchor points are a doddle to access, too, and the large rear door openings make it easy to fit a bulky child seat. It’s not just spacious in the back seats, because the Volkswagen Touareg comes with a seriously big boot, too. With the back seats in place, there’s more room for a few sets of golf clubs or a large baby buggy than in anything else you might be considering – though the Audi Q7 and Mercedes GLE have a bit more room with the back seats folded. It’s a shame there’s no seven-seat option, though. There are five engine options, but VW’s 231hp 3.0-litre diesel engine fits the bill perfectly for most. This turbocharged V6 has plenty of grunt to pull heavy trailers or blast past slow-moving traffic. It’s impressively quiet around town and whispers along almost silently at motorway speeds, though company car buyers will be more tempted by the lower tax you get with the plug-in hybrids . Driving the Volkswagen Touareg is pretty relaxing – despite its daunting size. You get a good view out and the light steering makes squeezing through tight spaces as easy as in any large SUV . If you spend lots of time driving in town, the optional four-wheel steering is well worth considering – it helps make the VW Touareg even more manoeuvrable by altering the angle of both the front and rear wheels to help you turn as tightly as possible. The standard automatic gearbox changes gear smoothly and doesn’t jerk or stutter at slow speeds, though it can be a bit slow to respond when you put your foot down on the motorway, though the Touareg is incredibly quiet and comfortable when driving at higher speeds. And that’s where much of its appeal lies, coupled with the spacious cabin and boot. It’s just a shame that the Touareg is a similar price to posher alternatives such as the Audi Q7 and BMW X5. As a result, you’re going to want to head over to Carwow’s Volkswagen Touareg deals page to see how much you could save, or browse the latest used Touareg stock available from our network of trusted dealers. You can also check out other used Volkswagen models and if you want to sell your car online , Carwow can help with that, too. How much is the Volkswagen Touareg? How much is the Volkswagen Touareg? The Volkswagen Touareg is priced at the lower end of the premium big SUV options, with its sub-£70,000 starting price around the same as you’ll pay for an entry-level Audi Q7 and BMW X5 , with the Porsche Cayenne being a bit more and the Mercedes GLE a lot more. However, the Touareg’s interior quality isn’t quite on par with those models, and is more closely matched with less expensive alternatives such as the Volvo XC90 and Lexus RX . The Touareg trim line-up is simple, at least. The lowest specification is the Elegance, but this is only available with a plug-in hybrid engine. The Black Edition is better-equipped but actually starts at a (slightly) lower price because it’s offered with regular diesel and petrol engines. At the top of the range is the R, though this is about £10,000 more than the other models because it has a high-performance hybrid engine and extra kit. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort Drives well, especially when fitted with air suspension, but not as fun as a BMW X5 It’s a big old thing, the VW Touareg, but considering its size it’s reasonably manoeuvrable. Go for the optional rear-wheel steering and it’s even better, as the rear wheels help to make a U-turn in double-quick time. You sit high, but not armchair-on-stilts high. So the driver has a good view out, but doesn’t look down on other cars the way you do in a Land Rover Defender . All-round visibility is pretty good, so you can see what’s behind you when reversing better than in some SUVs. Every Touareg is an automatic, and while the gearbox could be quicker to respond, it’s very smooth. You glide along through stop-start traffic, and couple this with the incredibly comfortable way it goes over bumps – only entry-level Elegance models don’t get the excellent air suspension – you have a very relaxing way to get about town, despite its heft. If you want to make your commute or school run emissions-free, take a closer look at one of the plug-in hybrid options, as these can run on electricity alone. Motorways are home sweet home as far as the Touareg is concerned. Whichever engine you go for you’re not short of performance, even when the car is loaded up with people and luggage. If you have a trailer or horsebox to pull then the diesels in particular make great tow cars, with lots of muscle for towing heavy loads. The car wafts along like a high-rise limo, even on the standard suspension you get with Elegance cars, but go for a model with air suspension and it’s even better. It’s comfortable to rack up miles in and there’s very little wind and road noise to contend with. It’s all very relaxing indeed. The only real downside is the lethargic gearbox, which can be slow to respond when you put your foot down. It’s smooth at a constant speed, but if you need to accelerate to pull off an overtake it can take a moment to drop a couple of gears and deliver the power, which is mildly frustrating. On the plus side you get adaptive cruise control as standard, which means you can set a target speed and the car will automatically slow down and speed up to keep a steady distance to the car in front. Turn off the motorway onto an empty back road and the Touareg handles well for such a big and heavy car. It doesn’t have the agility of a BMW X5, but it corners with poise by big SUV standards. It’s just not very exciting and does nothing to encourage you to have fun on a twisty road, even if you put it in sport mode. There is the more powerful Touareg R , though, if you want the best-handling version. The steering is precise, and body lean isn’t excessive even if you arrive at a bend a little faster than you meant to. Bumpy roads won’t upset your passengers too much – again, cars with air suspension are even better than those with the standard set up. Every Touareg is a true 4x4 , which is a big plus if the weather is wet or wintery. If the twisty road turns into a twisty track, the Touareg can handle itself. It’s not as able as a Land Rover Discovery when the going gets really tough, but pulling a horsebox over wet grass shouldn’t be a problem. Space and practicality Space and practicality Lots of space for people and luggage, but no seven-seat option You step up into the Touareg, but you won’t need a step ladder. The seating position is not as lofty as in a Land Rover Discovery or a Range Rover , and the seat isn’t all that high from the floor on its lowest setting. The result is that it feels like you’re driving a big Golf hatchback, rather than an SUV, which will appeal to some but if you want that commanding driving position then alternatives will appeal more. There’s a good range of adjustment in the wheel and seat, though, so you should be able to find a comfortable driving position in the Touareg. Storage is well taken care of, with the exception of the surprisingly stingy space under the driver’s armrest. There’s a lidded storage tray at the base of the centre console, and the glovebox is disappointingly small. You also get a second mini glovebox to the right of the steering wheel. The door bins are very large, with room for a flask to fit inside. There are two cupholders between the front seats, with a third smaller cupholder sandwiched between the two for holding an espresso. Plenty of SUVs of this size have space for seven, but the Touareg can only seat five. That’s bad news for big families, but because Volkswagen hasn’t had to split the available space between three rows of seats there’s loads of spare room in the back. Even with a panoramic sunroof there’s plenty of headroom, and legroom is more than generous. There’s space for passengers to put their feet under the seat in front so they can really stretch out. If you have three rear passengers, whoever is in the middle will be perched up a little higher than those on either side, but it’s certainly not an uncomfortable space to sit. There’s an armrest which folds down out of the middle seat back when it’s not in use. But it’s annoying that there’s no cover for the twin cupholders, as the plastic digs into your elbow. You get lots of room for bags in the Volkswagen Touareg. Again, it helps that Volkswagen hasn’t needed to squeeze in a third row of seats. In terms of pure capacity, nothing gets close to the Touareg’s 810 litres of capacity. The Porsche Cayenne is the biggest alternative at 770 litres, followed by the Audi Q7 and Mercedes GLE at 740 and 730 litres respectively. Everything else has less than 700 litres. It’s worth noting that plug-in hybrid models have less space, and for the Touareg that means 655 litres. However, that’s bigger than equivalent alternatives, with the Cayenne dropping to 645 litres, the X5 to 500 litres and the GLE to 490 litres. The Volvo XC90 enters the discussion here, because although the regular model only gets 680 litres of space, the hybrid doesn’t lose much at 640 litres. The Toureg’s boot opening is nice and wide and there’s hardly any load lip to lift your luggage over. Volkswagen has put some thought into getting the most out of the space, with tie-down points and hooks for holding bags upright. Levers either side of the tailgate fold the seats down, though you’ll need to run around to the rear doors and give the seats a shove to lock them into position. Doing so opens 1,800 litres of space, which is surprisingly less than you get with the Mercedes, Volvo and BMW (but still a pretty big area to work with). Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories Stylish and high-tech, but not as well finished as the best premium SUVs When does the motoring mainstream end and the premium brands begin? We pose the question because the Touareg seems poised a little awkwardly in the middle. It’s not as posh as an Audi or Mercedes, but it’s arguably more upmarket than a Hyundai or Kia . Having some badge appeal without being snobby serves Volkswagen well with the likes of the Golf, Passat , and Tiguan . But with a price tag of well over £60k, the Touareg is stretching into snootier territory. It doesn’t help that the cabin can’t quite match the showroom appeal of the Audi Q7’s or the Mercedes GLE’s. It’s an off-the-peg number at a price that many expect haute couture. There are some scratchy plastics on the doors, and some of the trim looks and feels a bit ordinary compared with the best luxury 4x4s. The plastics on the top of the dash are much better, and the higher up the range you go the nicer the cabin looks. It’s a plush interior by most standards, it’s just that similarly priced cars are even better. Pre-2023 models had smaller screens, but the latest version has a 12.0-inch digital driver’s display and 15.0-inch infotainment screen as standard, which comes with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto . The system is pretty slick overall, but you now get Volkswagen’s weird touch-sensitive steering wheel buttons that are tricky to use and there are no physical climate control buttons. MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax There are five engines to choose from, with one petrol, two diesels and two plug-in hybrids, all of which utilise a 3.0-litre combustion engine, eight-speed automatic gearbox and come with all-wheel drive. The petrol is the most powerful non-hybrid with 340hp, but its fuel economy suffers at 25.7mpg. The diesels make 231hp and 286hp, though both return 34.4mpg on the official tests. In the real world it’s likely that the less powerful model will return better economy, but during our time with the more powerful version we got close to the official figures with 32mpg, which is pretty good. If you have a place to charge, the plug-in hybrids will be the most economical, but it’s important to note that the official economy figures of more than 120mpg won’t be achievable if you do a lot of motorway miles or don’t keep the batteries charged. They are the most powerful options too, with 381hp and 462hp, the latter only being offered in the sporty R trim. Because the Touareg range costs well over £40,000, even if you go for the entry-level model, there’s extra Vehicle Excise Duty to pay in years two to six. Company car buyers will want one of the plug-in hybrid models as these come with the lowest benefit-in-kind tax. Safety and security Safety and security The Touareg earned the maximum five stars when it was tested by Euro NCAP ’s safety experts in 2018, but tests have become stricter since then. It scored 89% for adult occupant protection, 86% for child occupants, 72% for pedestrian protection and 81% for its safety assistance systems. Every car comes with an active bonnet that lifts up in a collision with a pedestrian to prevent them hitting the engine. Step up to the Black Edition and you get an automatic parking system, too. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems The Touareg presents a mixed picture in reliability surveys. It does very well in some, and not so well in others. But we’re not hearing of many problems with the current generation, which has been on sale since 2018. If you want cast-iron reliability, a Lexus RX is tough to beat, but you shouldn’t expect much trouble from a Touareg. Like other Volkswagens, the Touareg comes with a three-year warranty. There’s no mileage restriction for the first two years, but a 60,000-mile limit applies in the third year, so it’s nowhere near as generous as Kia and Hyundai in particular."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/volkswagen/id7-tourer,Volkswagen ID.7 Tourer Review & Prices,"€67,628",9/10,new,"Is the Volkswagen ID7 Tourer a good car? Is the Volkswagen ID7 Tourer a good car? Volkswagen has a long history of making great, large estate cars - the VW ID7 Tourer is the company’s latest, and in many ways one of its best. It’s a large, family-sized electric car , but being an estate instead of an SUV means it’s both better to drive and look at than VW’s own ID4 or ID5 models. Compared to those two cars, it’s like the annoying overachieving sibling - it’s handsomer, better at everything and should by all rights be the most popular. Yet the craze for SUVs means many buyers will look right past it, which is a shame. There are a few all-electric estate car alternatives to the ID7 Tourer, but they’re either a fair bit cheaper or much, much more expensive. In the former camp there’s the MG5 EV and above that, the closely-related Vauxhall Astra Sports Tourer Electric and Peugeot E-308 SW . On the other side, the BMW i5 Touring and Porsche Taycan Sport Turismo offer much more of a luxury experience - but with far more of a luxury price tag. Volkswagen ID7 Tourer: electric range, battery and charging data Range: 358 - 424 miles Efficiency: 4.1 - 4.9 mi/kWh Battery size: 77kWh/86kWh Max charge speed: 175kW/200kW Charge time AC: 11hrs 55m/12hrs 50m 0-100% Charge time DC: 30m 10-80% Charge port location: Right rear Power outputs: 286hp/340hp The ID7 Tourer looks great from the outside. It has a minimalist aesthetic, like Volkswagen’s other electric cars, and the design is dominated by a full-width lightbar at either end. The front one even incorporates a light-up Volkswagen logo, so that everyone knows what you’re driving even after dark. On the inside, practicality is a very strong point. Even when the front seats are all the way back, there’s room in the rear for a six-footer to get really comfortable - and thanks to the Tourer’s greater headroom compared to the ID7 hatch , they’ll have even more space. Meanwhile, the ID7 Tourer’s boot is larger than any other electric estate car on sale - it’s also bigger than VW’s own ID4 SUV. Interior quality is a step up compared to the other cars in the ID line-up. Everything feels nicely-built, but there’s still an over-reliance on screens over physical buttons. Other than a hazard warning switch, everything on the ID7’s interior is controlled through either the central touchscreen or the touch-sensitive steering wheel controls. It makes the ID7 quite difficult to recommend to anyone who isn’t a bit of a technophile - having the air-con controls through the screen is one thing, but using it to control the direction of the air vents is a step too far. The ID7 Tourer’s powertrain is tied to the trim level, and there are two battery sizes and two electric motors to choose from. Even the more basic Pro Match model can do over 300 miles on a charge, but if you opt for the Pro S Match version you get an official range of 424 miles - that’s one of the longest-range electric cars on sale. We’ll update this review with driving impressions once we’ve been behind the wheel. If you can’t wait until then, check out Carwow’s Volkswagen ID7 Tourer deals to get a great price. You can also browse used Volkswagen prices from our network of trusted dealers, and when the time comes to sell your current car , Carwow can help with that, too. How much is the Volkswagen ID7 Tourer? How much is the Volkswagen ID7 Tourer? The ID7 Tourer starts from a little over £52,000, which neatly splits the difference between the priciest Vauxhall Astra Sports Tourer Electric (around £40,000) and the cheapest BMW i5 Touring (around £70,000). Prices rise to just over £56,000 for the long-range Pro S Match model, and just over £62,000 for the sportier GTX version. Rather irritatingly, a heat pump - for more efficient heating and improved range in the winter - is optional equipment on all three, and it’s a pricey piece of kit, too. Otherwise, standard equipment is pretty good with all versions getting a 15-inch infotainment touchscreen , extended head-up display , keyless entry, three-zone climate control, a powered tailgate and Matrix LED headlights . Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort Very comfortable and great for long trips, but not as good as a BMW i5 Touring in the corners The ID7 Tourer isn’t quite as reassuring to drive in town as the taller ID4 - you don’t have such a commanding view of the road ahead, nor do you feel like you can intimidate smaller traffic. The ID7 Tourer is also a fairly big and very long car, so you won’t be nipping into the smallest gaps in traffic or parking in the tightest spaces. However, those are criticisms you can lay at any family-sized car - and the ID7 does have some advantages in town. The electric powertrain is of course totally smooth, with instant response at low speeds making it easy to get going. Volkswagen’s augmented-reality head-up display is also really useful in complicated town junctions, as it overlays where you need to go onto the road ahead - helpful at multi-exit roundabouts, for example. The car’s long wheelbase means it deals pretty effectively with speed bumps and the like, but sharper potholes and road imperfections can jolt through the cabin. The Volkswagen ID7 Tourer is one of the best electric cars you can buy for motorway driving. The long range is of course a big draw here - charging an electric car on the motorway is very expensive and nobody wants to have to stop every hundred miles to top up the batteries - but it’s also powerful, comfortable and quiet. The standard car gets a 286hp electric motor, which is ample even in this big car - though if fully loaded with passengers and luggage, you may wish you’d gone for the 340hp GTX model instead. Refinement is top-notch. The ID7 is smooth and slippery, so wind noise is minimal, and even on the biggest wheels road noise is unobtrusive too. Combine that with excellent seats and Volkswagen’s useful Travel Assist adaptive cruise control , and you’ve got an extremely relaxing motorway cruiser. Get the ID7 Tourer onto a twisting back road and while it doesn’t feel insecure or dangerous, it certainly doesn’t encourage you to press on in the same way as a BMW i5 Touring. Corner with a bit too much pace and the car’s safety systems soon step in to keep everything on the straight and narrow. That’s also true in the high-performance GTX model, which has four-wheel drive for even more grip - so while you can take corners quickly, you won’t necessarily feel the car being playful. GTX models also get Volkswagen’s adaptive suspension, which you can adjust by 13 levels of firmness. At the softest, it’s much more pillowy and good for cruising, while at the firmest there’s virtually no body lean in the corners. A Kia EV6 and BMW i5 Touring both feel more communicative on a good road, but the ID7 does feel more substantial and you feel more comfortable giving it some welly than you do in a Vauxhall Astra Electric or Peugeot e-308 SW. Space and practicality Space and practicality A huge boot and great space for rear-seat passengers, but the rear middle seat isn’t the best Up front, the VW ID7 Tourer feels extremely practical. The seats are very comfortable and adjust for drivers of all shapes and sizes, including a pull-out seat base to support those with longer legs. Storage for smaller items is good too. The door bins are a reasonable size, easily accommodating a big bottle of water, and there’s a felt-lined cubby by the driver’s knee for smaller items such as keys. There’s also a deep cubby in the armrest, while a pair of roller shutters cover the multi-use storage area in the centre. This includes two big cupholders and a wireless phone charger. There’s room in the back for a pair of six-footers to stretch out - it’s practically palatial, though not quite as roomy as a diesel-powered Skoda Superb Estate . The ID7 hatchback is similarly spacious, but the Tourer’s squarer roofline does actually improve headroom a bit too. It is however best for two occupants. The centre rear seat is set higher and is quite narrow, so it’s not the best if you want to squeeze three adults across the back. A flat floor does at least mean there’s space for everyone’s feet. Rear passengers get big door bins, map pockets on the front seatbacks with a smaller pocket for smartphones, and two cupholders in the fold-down central armrest. All that room is great for fitting bulky child seats, and the ID7 Tourer has ISOFIX points on the outer rear seats to facilitate this. There’s also a point on the front passenger seat if you’d rather have your child up front. With 605 litres of space, the ID7 Tourer’s boot is simply cavernous. It beats out the 570-litre BMW i5 Touring and even the roomy Peugeot e-308 SW’s 548 litres. Put simply, if you want more boot space, you’ll need to opt for an SUV, like the Tesla Model Y . There’s certainly room for a whole family’s worth of suitcases, or a good trip to the flat-pack furniture outlet. It’s a wide, flat space, and an electric tailgate comes as standard so access is nice and easy. The rear seats fold flat effortlessly, though it’s a shame that they only split 60:40 - both the BMW and the Peugeot have 40:20:40 folding rear seats, which allow long, thin items to be carried at the same time as two rear passengers. The ID7 Tourer does have a small ski hatch, but it’s not the same. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories The best Volkswagen touchscreen yet, but the interior is totally over-reliant on it Volkswagen has routed just about every one of the ID7 Tourer’s functions through the touchscreen. And when we say every one, we mean not just the usual things like sat-nav, or the secondary functions like the climate controls - you can’t even manually adjust the direction of the car’s air vents without venturing into an onscreen menu. At least Volkswagen hasn’t gone full Tesla, and you do still get separate controls for the side mirrors as well as a drive selector on the steering column. However, the air vents will certainly be a step too far for technophobes. The touchscreen otherwise is big, clear and responsive. It runs Volkswagen’s latest software which is a huge improvement over its earlier cars. The key addition is customisable shortcuts at the top and bottom, which allow you to put the functions that you want front and centre. This gives you a quick route to easily turn off the more annoying driver assistance functions, for example. If you want to bypass Volkswagen’s own system, wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto come as standard, with the wireless phone charger under the centre console complimenting this for a tidier, cable-free interior. There are USB-C ports just ahead of this if you’d prefer to plug in or if your phone doesn’t support wireless charging, though. The ID7 also gets a small screen just ahead of the driver for essential information - this isn’t very customisable, but it doesn’t really need to be. The bigger deal is the massive augmented-reality head-up display, which can be tricky to get used to at first but works very well when you do. Build quality inside the ID7 Tourer is good - it’s not as luxurious as the BMW i5 Touring, though, with some harder plastics and a few more suspect cheap areas. Considering the price, we’d hope for material quality to be at least on par with the cheaper Peugeot E-308 SW, though. And it’s a shame that regardless of which ID7 Tourer you go for, you’re limited to an all-black interior colour palette - a lighter option would make the interior feel more spacious. Electric range, charging and tax Electric range, charging and tax The VW ID7 is a very efficient electric car, which combined with its big battery means some really impressive range figures. The entry-level car gets a 77kWh battery and 286hp electric motor, and claims a maximum range of 373 miles. If you want more range, the Pro S Match version keeps the 286hp motor but ups the battery capacity to 86kWh, giving a theoretical maximum range of 424 miles. That makes it one of the longest-range electric cars on sale, though the ID7 hatchback does return an even more impressive 436 miles. Opt for the sporty GTX model and you get the bigger battery, but range drops to a more disappointing 358 miles. During our time with this car over a variety of roads, we saw around 300 miles - suggesting that you should be able to get more than 350 miles from the Pro S Match version. Charge speeds aren’t quite as good as the Kia EV6 but they’re still decent, with a maximum rate of 175kW for the smaller battery and 200kW for the larger one. This means that both should top up from 10-80% in about half an hour from a sufficiently powerful public charger. On a home charger, you’re looking at around 12 hours for a full charge from 0-100%, but daily top-ups should be fine, and with so much capacity in reserve you should very easily be able to do a full week’s mileage without going above 80% charge. The ID7 Tourer pays the lowest rate of road tax, common to all electric cars, and fits into the lowest band for company car benefit-in-kind tax too. Safety and security Safety and security The ID7 Tourer inherits a full five-star Euro NCAP safety rating from the ID7 hatchback, with a very impressive Adult Occupant Protection score of 95%. All models get a full glut of safety equipment, including the usual mandated autonomous emergency braking, traffic sign assist and speed limit alerts. The addition of a 360-degree camera, Travel Assist automatic cruise control, self-parking and schmancy Matrix LED headlights are all very nice to have, though, and come as standard on all versions of the ID7 Tourer. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems Volkswagen came a disappointing 29th out of 32 brands in the 2024 Driver Power owner satisfaction survey . Earlier VW electric cars suffered a lot with software bugs and gremlins, and while you’d hope they would have been ironed out by now you should probably not expect the ID7 to be as trouble-free as a Kia EV6. Warranty cover also isn’t as generous as the Kia, at three years or 60,000 miles of coverage. The battery does get separate cover for eight years or 100,000 miles, though that’s very much in line with every other manufacturer. Volkswagen ID7 Tourer FAQs Volkswagen ID7 Tourer FAQs"
https://www.carwow.co.uk/volkswagen/golf-estate,Volkswagen Golf Estate Review & Prices,"€40,016",8/10,new,"Is the Volkswagen Golf Estate a good car? Is the Volkswagen Golf Estate a good car? The Volkswagen Golf Estate is a spacious family car that is well made and very sensible. Its main rivals are the Ford Focus Estate , Vauxhall Astra Sports Tourer and the Peugeot 308 SW . A more up-market rival is the Mercedes CLA Shooting Brake . Quite possibly the Golf Estate's biggest selling point is the interior, which is made from expensive-feeling soft-touch plastics and feels built to last. The car is also hugely practical – there is space for four to travel in comfort, the boot is huge and there are numerous storage areas dotted around the cabin. Being the best to drive was never a target for the Golf Estate – for that buy a Focus Estate. Instead, the Golf focusses on providing a safe and predictable driving experience giving the driver confidence. The automatic gearbox is one of the best in the class. There is a huge range of engines for the Volkswagen Golf Estate and there is one for any buyer’s needs. If it’s economy you want go for the 1.6-litre diesel, or if you’re looking for performance there is the 305hp Golf R Estate. The best choice, however, is the 2.0-litre middle-of-the-line diesel that’s not only frugal but also plenty powerful. All models are generously appointed with standard equipment including a DAB digital radio, air conditioning and Bluetooth phone connection. In general, the Volkswagen Golf Estate is one of the best mid-size estates on sale. Whilst there are cheaper rivals, few come close to the all round ability and sense of quality the Volkswagen offers. It’s very close to the hatchback in terms of handling, so you can still enjoy the sweet balance between ride and handling without having to compromise space or practicality. Choose the right engine and you won’t be spending a lot on fuel bills, either. The VW Golf Estate’s biggest problem comes from within its own ranks – it’s called the Skoda Octavia Estate . What the Golf has over the Octavia in class, the Skoda more than makes up for with more space and a cheaper asking price. To see what sort of offer you can get, go through to our VW Golf Estate deals and used Volkswagen cars for sale pages, and find out how you can sell your car through carwow as well. How much is the Volkswagen Golf Estate? How much is the Volkswagen Golf Estate? Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort The VW Golf Estate’s ride quality is excellent, and the suspension soaks up bumps in the road with ease There’s a huge choice of engines and, to be honest, all of them are great at what they do. New for the 2017 model is a 1.5-litre petrol that takes the place of the outgoing 1.4-litre. These advanced new EVO engines benefit not only from cylinder-on-demand technology but automatic models also have an advanced coasting function, which decouples the engine from the gearbox where possible to save fuel. VW claims it can improve fuel economy by up to 8mpg bringing the quoted average for the 148hp model to 58mpg and 61mpg for the 128hp version. However, if you’re looking for impressive fuel consumption, the two diesels are the ones to go for. The cheaper of the pair is a 1.6-litre that should have no problems moving the Volkswagen Golf Estate around, though it won’t feel spritely when the car’s fully loaded. If you believe VW’s figures it can return fuel economy of 74mpg. The other diesel in the range is arguably all you’ll ever need in a VW Golf Estate. It produces 148hp, but the meaty torque available from very low in the rev range is what wins you over. It isn’t fast but it’s not slow either, cracking 0-62mph in a smidge under nine seconds. Quoted fuel economy sits at 67mpg and it’s easy to average around 55mpg in the real world. There’s another, more powerful, version of that 2.0-litre that packs 184hp. It is only available in the hot GTD Estate model which also benefits from more aggressive styling, stronger brakes and bigger wheels. It’s a step below the full-blown 305hp Golf R Estate and provides most of the visual updates over a standard Golf that the R gets while the quoted fuel economy figure of 61mpg is decent enough for the performance on offer. Models with 125hp and upwards get a sophisticated rear suspension system that deals with the UK’s bumpy roads more successfully than the basic setup and also makes the Golf feel more surefooted in corners. Despite some added weight, the Volkswagen Golf Estate is identical to drive to the hatchback. You can opt for ACC (Adaptive Chassis Control), which lets you set the firmness of the suspension settings – our advice, unless you’re going to drive flat-out everywhere, is not to bother, especially because it’s an £800 option. It’s definitely not the most fun to drive among its rivals, however the Volkswagen Golf Estate does a really good job at everything else. Out on the motorway, it’s hushed and only if you turn off the radio you can hear a faint wind whistle coming from the side mirrors. Whereas in town, the light steering makes short work of low-speed manoeuvres. Space and practicality Space and practicality The Volkswagen Golf Estate has plenty of room inside for passengers and the boot is a very decent size, although it’s not the very biggest There’s plenty of space whichever seat you sit in, with lots of head and legroom. The seats are comfortable and supportive and the standard cloth upholstery looks smart. Mid-range models and up also get a small lever on the side of the driver’s seat which adds even more adjustments to the, arguably, near-perfect driving position. There are loads of storage areas dotted around the cabin that only increase the practicality of the VW Golf Estate. A litre bottle fits in each of the door pockets and there’s space left for keys and the like. And whatever you put in there won’t rattle because the door pockets are lined with felt. People buy estates for their boot space, and the Volkswagen Golf Estate excels in this key area. Its load capacity is 605 litres (1,620 with the rear seats folded down) and it’s larger than almost all rivals of a similar price range – although the Skoda Octavia estate (610 litres) and Peugeot 308 SW (660 litres) boots are even bigger. Not only is the load bay large, but it has a wide opening and a low load lip so even big objects are easy to load. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior quality is one of the VW Golf Estate’s biggest selling points – giving premium quality at a mainstream price Some might hanker after a little more verve, but the simple layout means the VW Golf Estate is extremely easy to operate and the touchscreen infotainment system represents a benchmark that rivals would do well to follow. The Volkswagen Golf Estate is the only car in its class to offer gesture controls, though it’s a feature that you’ll probably show off once to your passengers and then forget about because the regular controls are already so intuitive. They’re only available on the most expensive system that comes with an expansive 9.2-inch screen and detailed graphics. Mid-range models get an eight-inch screen, which drops to 6.5 inches in basic cars. All have an easy-to-understand-menu structure that makes them some of the best in class. Making a more-convincing case for itself than the gesture controls is the 12.3-inch Active Info display that sits behind the steering wheel in place of analogue dials. It’s as configurable as the central infotainment screen – and is at its most eye-catching displaying huge and detailed maps for the sat-nav."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/volkswagen/tiguan,Volkswagen Tiguan Review & Prices,"€50,734",8/10,new,"Is the Volkswagen Tiguan a good car? Is the Volkswagen Tiguan a good car? The Volkswagen Tiguan has one of the simplest recipes of any family SUV . It looks good without being too in-yer-face, is spacious without being intimidating to drive in town, and has a lovely interior without being so posh you’re scared to get your kids’ grubby figures anywhere near it. All features that earned it a Highly Commended award in the Family Values category of the 2025 Carwow Car of the Year Awards . It’s the spaghetti bolognese of the car world. It might be simple but there’s rarely a circumstance where it doesn’t hit the spot. However, like your spaghetti is just one of a number of pasta dishes you could order, there are numerous Tiguan alternatives that are similarly sized, similarly priced SUVs. Go for a top-spec model and it’s an alternative to posh SUVs such as the Audi Q3 and BMW X1 , though it does lack some of their badge appeal. Or you could consider an entry-level version alongside a well-specced Nissan Qashqai or Kia Sportage . Where the Volkswagen Tiguan has an advantage over all of those cars is its boot, which at 652 litres is considerably bigger than anything else at a similar price. That means you’ll be able to fit prams and after-school sports equipment all at once, should the need arise. The interior design is all-new, with a massive infotainment touchscreen in the centre of the dashboard, making it not far off those upmarket BMW and Audi alternatives. There are configurable shortcut buttons across the top and bottom of the display, with the large central home screen showing the sat nav, music and other important information. It’s quick to respond to inputs and has bright, clear graphics, but you still get Volkswagen’s unintuitive touch-sensitive sliders for the climate control. On the plus side, you also get an excellent digital instrument display, which is included as standard and bigger than the one on the old Tiguan. The exterior hasn’t had quite such an extensive overhaul as the interior, but the old Tiguan was starting to look dated, so the sleek LED headlights that run into a full-width black panel give it a fresh new look. At the back, you get a similar light panel that runs along the bootlid, but the likes of the Kia Sportage are more interesting to look at. A diesel engine is a rare treat these days for those who do big miles, but one of the two petrols will be a better fit for most drivers. A pair of plug-in hybrids are on the way later in 2024, with a useful electric-only range of 62 miles. They will be a bit more expensive than other engines but low running costs could make it the best pick if you have access to regular charging. It’s worth waiting for the plug-in if you need a company car , because it will have the lowest Benefit-in-Kind tax rate by far. There will be no electric Tiguan, so check out our list of the best electric SUVs if that’s what you’re after. Behind the wheel, the Tiguan is quiet, comfortable and refined to drive around town and on the motorway. The suspension is well-judged, so that it soaks up big bumps without causing the body to wobble around. This makes the Tiguan a great car for daily driving duties, but the light steering and refined suspension mean it’s not the most exciting car on a twisty road, even if you pop it into its sportiest setting. If you like what you hear you can see how much you could save with Carwow’s Volkswagen Tiguan deals . You could also get a great deal on the outgoing car by browsing used Tiguan models, as well as extensive stock of other used Volkswagens from our network of trusted dealers. When it’s time to sell your car , Carwow can help with that, too. How much is the Volkswagen Tiguan? How much is the Volkswagen Tiguan? Pricing kicks off from just over £34,000, which is more expensive than many alternatives - it’s around £5,000 more than an entry-level Kia Sportage or Skoda Karoq , for example, and similar to posh options such as the BMW X1 and Audi Q3. However, the Tiguan is extremely well-equipped so its entry spec is more equivalent to a mid-spec model from other manufacturers, which narrows the gap somewhat. Though you can still get a Nissan Qashqai with all the trimmings for the Tiguan’s entry price. There are five trim levels to choose from on the Tiguan. Entry-level models are only offered with a 130hp petrol engine, but step up to the Life trim and you get a wider choice of engines and more kit. At the top of the range you have the Elegance and R-Line trims, which both come loaded with equipment, but the latter has sportier styling on the outside and body-hugging seats inside. Both are pretty tempting, being just £5,000 more than the entry-level model. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort Quiet and comfortable, but not the most exciting car to point down a twisty road The Volkswagen Tiguan hits a sweet spot in its dimensions, because it’s big enough that you get a spacious interior but it’s not so big that it’s intimidating to drive around town. Visibility is pretty good and you sit high for a commanding view of the road ahead. You also get light steering, so you can quickly pull off tight manoeuvres when required and almost forget you’re in a practical SUV. The suspension is well-judged too, so if you hit a big speed bump it doesn’t send a crash through the cabin and settles down quickly. There is a slightly firm edge though, so some sharper edges such as potholes are more noticeable. Going for a lower trim with smaller alloy wheels should help with that, though. Entry-level models don’t get a huge amount of assistance kit, but usefully all Tiguans come with front and rear parking sensors as well as a reversing camera. Step up to the Life trim and you get a system that will park the car for you. The comfort and refinement largely continues out on the motorway, where the Tiguan is quiet at higher speeds. The suspension continues to deal with bumps well on the whole here, but there is a bit of road noise to contend with – though again, our test car was a top-spec model with the 20-inch alloy wheels, so lower trims should be a bit quieter. Overtaking can take a little forethought, because although the gearbox can shift gears quickly and smoothly in most driving situations, if you give the throttle a push for a quick squirt of power the car can take a moment to realise you need a lower gear. Again, it’s the entry-level model that’s missing useful assistance kit, but all other versions come with adaptive cruise control that can maintain your speed as well as keep a safe distance to the car in front. Lane-keeping assistance is standard-fit, but top-spec models get Travel Assist, which can help you stay in your lane while cruise control is active. As is usual for cars that major on comfort and refinement in most driving situations, there is some sacrifice to be made when it comes to having fun on a twisty road. You do get decent grip from the tyres, but the steering is quite light and doesn’t give a lot of feedback to inform you of that fact, which knocks your confidence and means you have to hold back a bit. You can switch the car to Sport and the throttle is more responsive and the gearbox is a bit more open to dropping gears when you accelerate. Once you get in the groove it manages to quickly switch up and down the gears and keep up with your needs much better than its standard setting. However, it all feels a bit synthetic and not hugely fun. Probably not a deal breaker for this sort of car, but a BMW X1 is more enjoyable in the twisties. Space and practicality Space and practicality Spacious interior with a useful boot, but some features are a little awkward The VW Tiguan is a pretty large car so it should come as no surprise that the front seats are expansive. There’s loads of adjustment in the seats and steering wheel, so finding a comfortable driving position shouldn’t be a problem for drivers of all shapes and sizes. A full leather upgrade with heating and ventilation is optional on all trim levels, while the faux-sporty R-Line trim comes with supportive bucket seats as standard. The centre console holds two wireless charging pads, for driver or front passenger, and they’re both big enough to accommodate even the largest of phones. The door bins are a good size, and they’re felt-lined so that items such as keys or coins won’t rattle around on the move. The glovebox is large, too. There’s loads of space in the back seats, as befits a family SUV. Two six-footers can easily sit behind front passengers of a similar size, with plenty of room for their knees and lots of headroom, even if the optional panoramic glass roof is fitted. A third passenger will be pretty comfortable, as the rear bench is quite flat and the centre seat comparatively wide. The rear seats slide and recline, and can even be heated. They split 60:40 but the centre seat can also be folded down separately to accommodate longer loads. Keep it upright, and rear passengers have access to a clever centre armrest with cupholders and a tray to hold a tablet in place. Storage in the back is good - there are two pockets on the back of each seat, and large door bins that are also felt-lined just like those in the front. There are two USB-C ports for keeping phones or devices topped up, too. There are ISOFIX mounting points in both outer rear seats, with covers that flip up rather than remove entirely so you can’t lose them. With wide-opening rear doors and plenty of space, plus a high-up seating position, it's easy-peasy to fit and remove child seats. With 652 litres of boot space, the new Tiguan has one of the largest boots of any family SUV. It’s far bigger than the Skoda Karoq (521 litres) Kia Sportage (591 litres) or even the massive Honda CR-V (617 litres) so it’s perfect if you need to load up for a big holiday or perhaps have young children and a bulky pushchair to accommodate. It’s not just big, either - it’s practical. There’s no load lip between the boot opening and the floor, so you don’t have to hoick items into it - and the rear seats fold down completely flat leaving no obstructions to you sliding items right to the back. You can fold the seats down from the boot, too, while there’s a clever ridge that keeps the rear seatbelts in place even when the seats fold. Annoyingly, though, you have to pull an awkward tab to get the seats back upright, and pull the release lever from the boot to unlock them before walking around to push them back up. There’s space underneath the floor for charging cables as well as other paraphernalia, though on premium models some of this room is taken up by the subwoofer for the uprated sound system. There’s also a three-pin socket and 12V power supply, both useful additions. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories A much better infotainment system than the old Tiguan, but physical switchgear would make it easier to use The Tiguan’s interior has undergone a transformation for the latest model and now looks a lot like VW’s latest electric cars. That means the dashboard is dominated by a touchscreen infotainment display measuring 12.9 inches on the diagonal as standard across the range, which controls all of the car’s major functions. It’s a big step forward over the last Tiguan’s infotainment and the software is much more similar to that used on modern smartphones. You’ll be instantly familiar with things like having multiple homescreens, configurable shortcuts and widgets, as well as gestures such as pressing and holding on things to adjust them. Climate controls have been relegated to a slim bar at the bottom of the display, which stays put - and underneath the screen you’ll find some touch-sensitive sliders that can control the volume or temperature. It’s better than some VWs, but it’s still not the easiest thing in the world to get used to. A Kia Sportage, with its straightforward software and panel of physical controls, is easier to navigate, and probably a bit safer to use on the move too. At least you get proper buttons on the steering wheel, whereas the last Tiguan had awkward touch-sensitive controls here that didn’t work particularly well. If you prefer voice control, the Tiguan gets the latest evolution of Volkswagen's system, which works well when you call upon it, but can be activated too easily in normal conversation. ChatGPT integration is coming soon, but as much as it feels like a bit of a gimmick, could be useful when your kids throw a question like 'why is the sky blue?' your way... Material quality is excellent throughout, certainly a cut above a lot of SUVs in this price range with soft-touch plastics and solid build quality. It’s not quite as lush as a premium competitor like a BMW X1, but it’s sufficiently upmarket and everything seems to be screwed together well. It’s only if you poke further that you’ll find the occasional hard plastic, like low down on the centre console or the rear door cards. MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax At launch the Tiguan will have three engine options - a turbocharged mild hybrid petrol with a choice of two power outputs, or a turbocharged diesel engine. Officially, these return up to 46.3mpg and 52.3mpg respectively - which isn’t bad for a car of this size but is certainly nothing special. Lower running costs will come soon after launch when a plug-in hybrid option becomes available. This will have an all-electric range of up to 62 miles, which is a very useful figure indeed - you might be able to comfortably cover your family’s weekly mileage on a single charge, reserving the petrol engine for longer trips or weekend getaways. A Kia Sportage or Ford Kuga PHEV will only cover around 40 miles on a charge. The plug-in hybrids will cost more than the regular engines to buy, though, and if you don’t regularly charge it up or do a lot of long-distance driving then the running costs aren’t likely to make up the difference. It is, however, definitely going to be the pick of the range for company car drivers, with low emissions promising great Benefit-in-Kind tax ratings. Safety and security Safety and security The Tiguan underwent testing by Euro NCAP in 2024, where it was given the full five stars. It scored well in all of the four main areas, with adult occupant safety getting 83%, while child occupant safety got an impressive 88%. The larger, but related Tayron scored similarly when that was tested in 2025. Safety systems play heavily into safety ratings now, and the Tiguan is loaded with them. You can expect systems such as lane assist, adaptive cruise control and autonomous emergency braking as standard. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems The standard Volkswagen warranty is a fairly measly three years/60,000 miles, while competitors from Hyundai, Kia and Toyota offer five, seven and up to ten years of cover respectively. VW’s reputation for reliability is middle of the pack, and the previous Tiguan didn’t do fantastically well in customer satisfaction surveys with software and safety equipment issues often reported. However, it’s far too early to know if the new Tiguan will be reliable, so we’ll hold out judgement. Volkswagen Tiguan FAQs Volkswagen Tiguan FAQs"
https://www.carwow.co.uk/volkswagen/id3,Volkswagen ID.3 Review & Prices,"€46,896",8/10,new,"Is the Volkswagen ID3 a good car? Is the Volkswagen ID3 a good car? The Volkswagen ID3 is basically the electric car equivalent to the Volkswagen Golf . It’s a mid-sized family hatchback which is the baby of Volkswagen’s EV range. Launched in 2019 and updated in 2023, the ID3 will fall on your shortlist if you’re considering other small-ish electric cars such as the Kia EV3 , MG4 EV , Renault Megane E-Tech , or Tesla Model 3 . The ID3 is as futuristic as it gets from Volkswagen, but being the brand of the ‘people’s car’ such modernism still has to be user-friendly and carefully implemented. A bit like trying to introduce your grandma to her new mobile phone. Before its facelift, the ID3 didn’t do this especially well and attracted criticism for its awkward user interface, but the 2023 update went a long way to addressing this with a new infotainment system and improved interior materials. The ID3 is a different shape to most hatchbacks - it’s quite tall, almost like a mini- MPV. A short bonnet, steep windscreen and big wheels all mean it stands out from the crowd. It’s not exactly handsome, but it’s a clean design - improved in the 2023 facelift which took away a set of silly decals that used to be standard on the rear pillar. Range: 261-369 miles Efficiency: 4.1-4.3 miles per kWh Battery size: 52kWh/ 58kWh / 77kWh / 79kWh Max charge speed: 120kW / 170kW / 185kW Charge time AC: 9hrs 30mins, 0-100%, 7kW / 12hrs 40mins, 0-100%, 7kW Charge time DC: 35mins, 5-80%, 120kW / 30mins, 5-80%, 170kW Charge port location: Right rear Power outputs: 170hp / 204hp / 326hp It’s even more minimalist on the inside. You get very few physical buttons, with most controls being routed through either the 12.9-inch touchscreen display or the touch-sensitive steering wheel buttons. In a bid to remove as much switchgear as possible Volkswagen’s even shunned separate controls for the rear windows. All this tech can be quite annoying to use - particularly the touch-sensitive sliders underneath the infotainment screen, which aren’t backlit at night and are really tricky to find when you’re driving. Space in the cabin benefits from the ID3’s tall silhouette, with good headroom and plenty of legroom. There’s a totally flat floor and the centre console is low, giving a nice feeling of airiness - helped by loads of glass, particularly the extra windows in the windscreen pillars that give you a good view at junctions. There are a choice of battery sizes and electric motors. The basic ‘Pure’ models can go around 240 miles on a charge and have modest performance, but you can step up through Pro and Pro S models with increasingly bigger ranges. The top model is the GTX - a performance-biased model that gets a sporty makeover, the biggest battery and the most powerful electric motor. All ID3s are rear-wheel drive and feel nice and solid on the road. Bumps and potholes are a bit too obvious, especially in models wearing the largest 20-inch alloy wheels, but the steering feels accurate and the turning circle is really tight. It’s good on a longer run too, with punch acceleration and good refinement at a cruise. What it’s not is particularly exciting - even the hot hatchback-like ID3 GTX. There’s a nice sensation that the rear-wheel drive is pushing you out of corners rather than pulling you around them, but otherwise there’s little enjoyment to be had - instead it feels neutral and safe. So while the VW ID3 is a pretty good electric car, it’s also one that struggles to stand out - there are loads of cheaper alternatives which are just as practical and feel every bit as solid and reassuring, even if they don’t quite have the Volkswagen’s badge kudos. If you’re interested, check out the best Volkswagen ID3 deals right here on Carwow. You can get a great price with our Volkswagen ID3 leasing deals , or find a used Volkswagen ID3 for sale too. And remember, Carwow can even help you to sell your old car when the time comes. How much is the Volkswagen ID3? How much is the Volkswagen ID3? With prices for the most basic Pure Essential model starting at just under £31,000, the Volkswagen ID3 is priced as a close alternative to the Volvo EX30 and Kia EV3 . The MG4 is quite a bit cheaper, so you could have a top-spec version for the same price as a basic ID3. Moving further up the ID3 range, cars like the Renault Megane E-Tech and Tesla Model 3 become closer alternatives. All ID3s bar the range-topping GTX cost less than £40,000, though, which helps keep road tax down. The Pro Match model would be our pick of the range - lower-spec ‘Essential’ cars get steel wheels, which feels rather stingy for a brand-new EV. However, all models do get full LED lights, a 12.9-inch infotainment screen, interior ambient lighting and climate control. Step up to the higher models and posh touches such as Matrix LED headlights, all-round cameras, a Harman Kardon sound system, augmented-reality head-up display and electric seats all become available. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort While it’s quiet and composed when cruising, the ID3 can feel a little firm in town The ID3 has light steering, a tight turning circle and great visibility out of the front - so driving it in town is a doddle. The extra windows in the windscreen pillars really help here, giving you a great view of junctions. The electric powertrain is totally smooth and it’s easy to modulate the power needed. There’s only one option for regenerative braking, though, activated by flipping the gear selector to ‘B’ rather than ‘D’. It’s not particularly strong and is a long way off the proper one-pedal drive modes you get in a Volvo EX30 or Kia EV3. The ID3’s comfort levels depend on the wheels you select. Top-spec models on the 20-inch alloys can thud over bumps and potholes, while things are much more cushioned on the 18-inch versions you get on more basic cars. No version is particularly uncomfortable, though - just a bit jiggly on rough surfaces. The ID3 is very comfortable on the motorway, and even models with the big wheels soon smooth out. Top-spec GTX versions come with adaptive suspension that can be made softer or firmer as needed, and at its softest it deals well with most road imperfections at speed. The lowest-spec models do feel a little underpowered when you’re trying to get down a sliproad or overtake decisively. The Pro and Pro S models are more powerful, and the range-topping GTX beefier still - though with 326hp on tap, it’s still slower than even the most basic Tesla Model 3. At least long-range efficiency is good, with the ID3 coming closer to its claimed range figure on the motorway than many alternatives. You can definitely feel that the ID3 is a heavy car when you get onto a twisty road - at over 1.8 tons, it’s about 400kg heavier than a Volkswagen Golf, largely thanks to all those batteries. As a result it doesn’t feel so agile when changing directions, and the body tends to lean more when you’re cornering fast. There is plenty of power, though, and the rear-wheel drive setup gives a satisfying feeling that you’re being pushed out of a corner, rather than the front wheels struggling for grip as they drag you out of it. However, the eco-focused tyres aren’t the stickiest, so if you’re too energetic entering a bend you will feel the front end start to lose traction. The sporty ID3 GTX is the best of the bunch on a twisty road, as it’s much more powerful - and unlike other Volkswagen IDX products, it’s still rear wheel drive. It’s a tiny bit more fun than the other cars in the range, capable of being a very slight hooligan - but the nannying safety features prevent it from being a true electric hot hatchback in the way a Hyundai Ioniq 5 N is. Space and practicality Space and practicality The bespoke EV has plenty of storage space in the cabin and boot, but there’s a lip out of the boot and no under-bonnet storage As it’s a purpose-built electric vehicle, the ID3 has all its batteries under the cabin floor, allowing Volkswagen to make the cabin feel more spacious and practical. You get decent sized doorbins – that aren’t lined, so things may rattle around – while you get a little net under the central touchscreen. The centre console is pretty useful too, with two large cupholders, a small bin to put your keys in and a diagonally-mounted wireless charger for your smartphone. There’s also a space under a sliding cover where you can plug devices in with USB-C ports. It’s really quite practical here. For seating, you get a good amount of adjustment whether there’s electric or manual controls, while the steering column has plenty of rake and reach – which also changes the driver’s display position. All versions have plenty of legroom and headroom - and, unlike pre-facelift, all versions do now accommodate three passengers. Big-battery models previously had just two seats in the rear. It's a bit narrow for three adults to sit abreast, though, and the centre seat is higher and harder than the outer two. There's a flat floor with space for everyone's feet, and even with the panoramic roof it doesn't feel cramped. With 385 litres, the ID3’s boot is a good size. It has a square shape, while you also get a 12V socket and hooks to hang bags off. There is a little bit of a load lip, but you shouldn’t struggle loading things. While the boot of the Renault Megane E-Tech is larger in capacity, the load lip is a lot deeper, the area is narrower and the space itself is a lot less practical on the whole. The MG4’s 363-litre boot is smaller, but has a dedicated area for the charging cables, so it ends up being about as practical as the Volkswagen. With an adaptable boot floor, folding the seats down gives you a flat load area – making sliding things forward a lot easier. If you just want to hold longer items, you get through-loading with a small hatch in the middle seat back. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories A bright, airy interior let down by annoying touch-sensitive controls The ID3’s cabin feels very open and spacious, with the large windscreen and extra windows in the pillars. A glass roof, optional on most models, is well worth paying extra for as it’s a proper panoramic affair stretching the whole length of the car - and it really floods the interior with light. The original ID3 used a lot of hard, scratchy plastics but the 2023 facelift remedied this with lots more soft-touch materials. The dashboard now feels pretty premium and the door cards have fabric or artificial leather covering all the bits you regularly touch. You have to look lower down in the footwells to find nastier materials - though the rear door cards feel a lot cheaper than the front ones. There’s no option for real leather - instead, you get artificial leather and fabric trim on all models. You will find the overall colour of the interior is pretty drab though. The only colour options are grey and black, with ambient lighting the only true splash of colour. Some lighter interior trim options would have been nice. The GTX does get some red accents, but these are minimal. Where Volkswagen has taken a major step back compared to alternatives in recent times is the infotainment setup. While the screens are clear to read, they are really lacking in ease of use when you’re driving. The annoying touch-sensitive sliders for the media volume and climate control are hard to pinpoint sometimes and when you’re trying to adjust them while on the move, it can be a struggle. The same happens with the steering wheel. The controls are both press and touch-sensitive, so you’ll brush your hand over the controls and your driver’s display view will change. Or, when you need to change the volume by not pressing the button down, it won’t do it. The dual-functionality of the setup can be frustrating. The touchscreen was improved drastically in the 2023 update, though. It’s now a huge 12.9 inches across as standard, and has permanent shortcut bars at the top and bottom allowing you far quicker access to functions like the climate controls, driving modes or driving assistance menus. You do have the option of using Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, both of which can be connected wirelessly. There’s also an optional augmented reality head-up display. Projected onto the windscreen, you will get direction arrows in front of you when using the navigation system, as well as your speed and other information you may want on there. It’s clear and stands out day or night. Electric range, charging and tax Electric range, charging and tax There’s a choice of four battery and motor combos with the ID3. The basic Pure models get a 52kWh battery and 170hp motor, good for a range of around 240 miles. Step up to the Pro and you get a 58kWh battery and 204hp motor, with a range boost up to around 270 miles. The Pro S cars get the same 204hp motor but a much larger 77kWh battery - range leaps up to 345 miles. The range-topping GTX gets the most performance, with 326hp on tap, as well as a slightly larger 79kWh battery good for a claimed range of 369 miles. In practice, the GTX’s extra performance dents real-world range, and you’ll see the best returns from the Pro S models. A genuine 300 miles should be possible if you’re not too heavy-footed, and unlike some alternatives the range gauge is both accurate and dynamic - meaning it changes depending on your driving style, so you can trust it. The smaller batteries can top up at a rate of 120Kw, allowing a 10-80% charge in about 26 minutes. For the Pro S, that figure jumps to 170kW, so even though it has a bigger battery charging times are similar provided you find a sufficiently powerful roadside charger. The same is true of the GTX, which has a bigger battery still but a max charge rate of 185kW. As a fully electric car the ID3 remains a smart choice for company car buyers thanks to low Benefit-in-Kind tax rates, while first-year road tax is the lowest available rate. Safety and security Safety and security Crash tested by Euro NCAP , the ID3 received a five-star rating with high scores across the four categories – both occupant protection and the safety assist sections scored particularly highly. As standard, the ID3 receives front assist with autonomous emergency braking, lane assist, driver alert detection, dynamic road sign detection and adaptive cruise control . You also get front disc brakes for improved stopping power. For additional security, the ID3 has all-round airbags, ISOFIX points on the outer rear seats and front passenger seat, E-Call for emergency assistance and an alarm with interior protection. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems While the ID3 has been mostly unscathed with major issues, two recalls have occurred. There was an issue with a missing bearing bush in the steering system, while some front passenger airbags weren’t bolted in correctly. Some vehicles have also been recalled over faulty battery modules, so if you’re looking at used versions of the ID3, make sure these have been resolved. For the first two years of ownership, you get an unlimited mileage warranty. When you reach the third year, you can either get to the end of that year or reach 60,000 miles on the clock for the warranty to run out. You can apply for an extended warranty through Volkswagen for that extra peace of mind. Volkswagen ID3 FAQs Volkswagen ID3 FAQs"
https://www.carwow.co.uk/volkswagen/passat,Volkswagen Passat Review & Prices,"€53,451",8/10,new,"Is the Volkswagen Passat a good car? Is the Volkswagen Passat a good car? The Volkswagen Passat is back, and this time there’s no saloon option – you can only get it as a mega spacious estate . That’s no problem, though, because it has always stood out for being big, practical and not quite as expensive as other Passat alternatives such as the Audi A4 Avant , BMW 3 Series Touring and Mercedes C-Class Estate . (Though the Skoda Superb Estate is the real value wagon.) It’s a bit like buying designer gear from TK Maxx – you’re getting the same sort of quality as you would from a big name store, but you don’t feel quite as posh in the process. Not that the Passat looks like a cheap alternative. It’s always had an understated class, and that continues with the latest model – it’s perhaps not as elegant as its predecessor but it’s certainly smart enough. And if you go for the R-Line model you get a big, imposing grille up front to go with the smart full-width rear light bar that’s standard across the range. It’s inside where Volkswagen has really taken the Passat up a notch, though. There’s a massive infotainment display in the centre of the dashboard that runs Volkswagen’s latest software. It’s a big improvement on recent VW systems, even if it is a touch annoying having to do everything through the screen. Running behind this and into the digital instrument display is an illuminated panel that gives the Passat a cool modern look, particularly at night. Overall build quality and refinement are great, too. There’s buckets of space whether you’re sitting in the front or the back, and there’s loads of room for a child seat, though an SUV requires you to bend down less. With a boot capacity of 690 litres with all seats in place, or 1,920 litres if you fold the second row down, there’s huge luggage capacity and useful square space that makes it easy to load up. Despite the Passat’s popularity with long-distance drivers, there are no diesel engines anymore. There's a 1.5-litre petrol making 150hp, but company car buyers will be more tempted by one of the two plug-in hybrid options, because of the lower benefit-in-kind rate. Both offer an excellent electric range of up to 80 miles, as well as impressive charge speeds by hybrid standards. They are a great choice if you do a lot of city driving, because the long range means you can pootle around on electric power to keep fuel bills down, but whichever engine you go for the Passat is a refined and comfortable car to cruise around in. It’s at its best on the motorway, and while you do notice a few sharper bumps in the cabin, the car settles quickly. It’s not particularly sporty though, so a BMW 3 Series Touring will be better if you want to make the most of the occasional twisty road. Find out how much you can save by browsing the latest new Volkswagen Passat deals available on Carwow. You can also get a great price on a used Passat , or other used Volkswagen models, through our network of trusted dealers. And when it’s time to sell your car , Carwow can help with that, too. How much is the Volkswagen Passat? How much is the Volkswagen Passat? Prices for the petrol-powered Volkswagen Passat start around £38,500, and it’s about £3,000 extra for the better-equipped Elegance model, then another £1,000 again for the top-spec, sporty R-Line. This makes it competitively priced among other posh estates, costing less across the range than the Audi A4 Avant, BMW 3 Series Touring, Mercedes E-Class Estate and Peugeot 508 SW . The only alternative that’s cheaper is the new Skoda Superb Estate , which is around £2,000 less than the Passat, depending on the engine you go for. Both have the same mechanical underpinnings, making it very tempting indeed. There are three trims available, called Life, Elegance and R-Line. Entry-level Life models get 17-inch alloy wheels, LED headlights and that massive infotainment system inside. Step up to Elegance and you get some extra sound insulation, heated front seats and a tilting and sliding panoramic sunroof. Top-spec R-Line models get a sporty exterior design with 18-inch alloy wheels, as well as a sports suspension setup, drive mode selection and sports seats. Most of the upgraded kit is available on lower trims as part of optional equipment packages so you can pick and choose if you want. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort The Volkswagen Passat is comfortable and quiet at higher speeds, but it’s not much fun on a twisty road The Volkswagen Passat was always a big car, but with the latest one being even bigger, it’s mildly intimidating to drive around town, and you don’t have the advantage of a high driving position improving visibility like you would in a big SUV. However, to make up for this, the Passat’s steering is pretty light, so it doesn’t feel at all cumbersome. You’ll barely notice lumps and bumps in the road thanks to the soft suspension, which means you won’t wince if you hit a pothole and negotiating speed humps won’t have you making a detour for the nearest chiropractor. The adaptive suspension system, which lets you choose between sportier or comfort-focused suspension on the move, is worth the extra money, mainly because it makes the car even more comfy over bumps than the standard setup. All cars have a reversing camera so you don’t have to worry about judging just how far back the car goes – though the resolution is disappointingly poor – and a system that automatically parks the car is also standard fit. This includes a ‘memory’ feature, so if you have an awkward manoeuvre to park up at home or work you can ask the car to remember the movements and do it for you in the future. The Volkswagen Passat’s natural habitat is cruising along at 70mph on the motorway. The suspension is soft so most bumps pass by like minor ripples in the road surface, and there’s little wind and road noise to contend with. Some sharper edges can send a thud through the cabin, but impressively for a comfort-focused car the suspension recovers quickly – there’s no wobbling around. The only real complaint is that the regular petrol engine doesn't quite have the performance you want for getting up to speed, which means sliproads and overtaking require you to really thrash the engine. In normal driving, though, economy is hugely impressive – 50mpg is easily achievable and you should see comfortably more than 500 miles to a tank. Continuing the Passat’s impressive list of standard equipment is the inclusion of adaptive cruise control , which will maintain your distance to the car in front in traffic. This can also work with the lane-keeping system to automatically nudge the steering to keep you centred in your lane – though you can turn this off if you don’t like it. The Passat shouldn’t be top of your shopping list if you’re after a practical estate that can also put a smile on your face when you find yourself on a winding country road. That light steering means it can be tricky to judge your inputs when going through a corner quickly. And the soft suspension means all bumps in the road surface are well filtered out, so you don’t get much feedback about how much grip you have. It’s perfectly capable of going round a corner quite quickly, but there’s an almost video game-like level of detachment. If you want to enjoy a twisty road, the BMW 3 Series Touring is a more enjoyable choice. Space and practicality Space and practicality There’s buckets of space throughout the Passat, but it’s low to the ground so getting kids in the back can be tricky The Volkswagen Passat is quite a big car, so those in the front seats will find they have plenty of space to stretch out. Coupled with the fact there’s a lot of adjustment in the steering wheel and seat, and it’s easy to get a comfortable driving position. Practicality is also a plus point, with big door bins that are felt-lined to stop things rattling around, a deep armrest cubby hole and a covered area that’s good for storing your phone away from prying eyes. This space is also home to a pair of USB-C slots, while a 12V socket is under the armrest. There’s loads of room in the back of the Passat. Even taller passengers will find plenty of headroom and legroom. Those in the outer seats might find their hair brushes the roof with three across the back, as they’re forced to the edge of the seat a bit, but at least there’s room for more feet in the footwell because the middle passenger has to straddle a large transmission tunnel. All of that space means it’s easy to fit a child seat without having to force the person in front to push their seat forward, and the ISOFIX mounting points are under flip up covers so you won’t lose them. The downside is that the Passat is quite low to the ground, so it’s trickier to get a child in than it would be in an SUV. Practicality is, again, pretty good though. There’s a pouch in the seat back and the door bins are smaller than in the front but still able to take a small water bottle. The centre armrest folds down to reveal a phone holder to make it easy to watch movies on the go, as well as a couple of cupholders. Luggage capacity is the Volkswagen Passat’s trump card. With 690 litres of space, it has considerably more boot capacity than any similarly priced alternatives, which all hover around the 500-litre mark. All except the new Skoda Superb Estate, which is built on the same underpinnings as the Passat and has identical boot capacity. The Passat’s boot is not just big, it’s also a good square shape, which means it’s easy to pack bulky items in. There’s also no lip and the bumper sits low to the ground, so you won’t struggle to lift heavy items in and out. You also get some good underfloor storage for lesser-used items, which is also a useful place to keep the charging cables in the hybrid. You fold the seats using levers in the top of the seat, which makes them ping down so you don’t need to go round and push them, and they lie pretty flat so you can push heavy objects through easily. This opens up 1,920 litres of space, which is, again, the same as the Superb but more than its alternatives manage. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories The Passat’s interior has a posh ambience, but the infotainment system is clunky Drop down into the comfortable front seats of the Volkswagen Passat and you will be impressed by how posh and upmarket the interior feels. There are squidgy plastics on all the stuff you regularly touch, with a few cheaper materials relegated to lower in the cabin. The design isn’t as sophisticated as an Audi or BMW, nor as cool and quirky as a Peugeot 508 SW, but there are some neat touches. For example, the dashboard features an illuminated panel that runs behind the infotainment screen and into the digital instrument cluster, which is particularly swish even if it does feel slightly unnecessary. Speaking of which, the 12.9-inch infotainment screen dominates the dashboard. Volkswagens of recent years have had pretty terrible infotainment software, which is typically glitchy and unintuitive to use. However, the latest version is much better. It's still a bit more laggy than the best alternatives, but it's an improvement and the menus are logically laid out. You also get proper buttons on the steering wheel, instead of the infuriating touch-sensitive panel used in cars such as the ID3 . However, Volkswagen hasn’t fully shaken loose its ergonomic woes. For example, some features that should be close at hand are anything but; changing the drive mode through the touchscreen is a clunky, distracting process and most climate settings are still controlled through the screen. If you’re willing to learn to live with these frustrations, or learn the button press routines you regularly use, then the Volkswagen Passat is a lovely, comfortable place to eat up big miles. MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax There are three engine choices in the Volkswagen Passat, made up of a single petrol and two plug-in hybrids. The petrol is a 1.5-litre unit making 150hp, and despite looking like not a lot of engine for quite a big, heavy car, there’s enough performance on hand for general driving situations, even if accelerating up to motorway speeds can be a laborious process. Economy is good for a big car too, at up to 51.8mpg in official tests, which is perfectly achievable with a light right foot. The pair of plug-in hybrids will be of particular interest to company car buyers, because they incur the lowest benefit-in-kind rates. Both have an impressive all-electric range of around 80 miles, and can charge at up to 50kW at a public chargepoint, which is fast for a hybrid. If you want the best economy though, you’ll want the lower-powered option. It makes a combined 204hp, compared with 272hp for the upgraded version. Thanks to that massive electric range, official economy figures are ridiculous – over 750mpg for the 204hp engine – though if you can keep the batteries topped up and don't do many long journeys you should rarely need to call upon the petrol engine, making running costs extremely low. Vehicle Excise Duty is on the lower side for the petrol thanks to its CO2 emission rating of 124g/km, though the plug-in hybrids are much cheaper here too. Safety and security Safety and security The Volkswagen Passat scored the full five stars in Euro NCAP safety tests. Its 93% rating for adult occupant safety was particularly impressive, though 87% and 80% for child occupants and safety assist systems are also respectable scores. Most of the assistance kit available for the car comes as standard, such as adaptive cruise control, automatic parking and a system to help avoid oncoming vehicles. Progressive steering, which makes the steering lighter at low speeds and less sensitive at high speeds, is standard on R-Line models but an optional extra across the other trims. It’s the same story with the driving modes, which allow you to alter the car’s characteristics to be more sporty, comfortable or economy-focused. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems With this being a new model, it’s not clear how reliable the Passat will be, though Volkswagen came 29th out of 32 manufacturers in the latest Driver Power owner satisfaction survey, which doesn't exactly inspire confidence. The company has suffered in recent years with its glitchy infotainment system, so that’s something to keep an eye out for despite the fact the Passat runs the latest updated software. Volkswagen offers one of the more basic warranties among car manufacturers in the UK. You get three years of cover, with the first two years covering unlimited mileage, but a cap of 60,000 miles being put on the final year. This is the same as you get with Audi and Skoda, while Mercedes offers unlimited mileage over the same time frame."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/volkswagen/taigo,Volkswagen Taigo Review & Prices,"€33,872",7/10,new,"Is the Volkswagen Taigo a good car? Is the Volkswagen Taigo a good car? The Taigo is one of Volkswagen ’s vast range of SUVs , offering a unique coupe-styled rear end as its USP and slotting in just above the T-Cross in both size and pricing. The basic design is rather similar, sharing much with both the smaller SUV and the one-size-up T-Roc . Think of the Taigo as the nearly identical twin with the cooler haircut. You get the same face as the Polo hatchback alongside some additional trim pieces to make it more aggressive and crossover-like, while there’s now a lightbar connecting the headlights like most newer VW models. It’s got a sleek side profile, ending with a small spoiler on the roofline. You also get some SUV-style cladding around the wheel arches and additional detailing around the back. ‘Taigo’ is also written out under the number plate and rear lightbar, and the roof bars add to its SUV feel. You can also choose from multiple two-tone paint options on the mid- and top-spec models. It doesn’t have the most exciting cabin, but you’re able to get a 10.0-inch touchscreen alongside a digital instrument display – the latter of which comes as standard. You also get climate controls with proper easy-to-use dials right out of the box, but higher-spec models get the annoying sliding touchbar setup introduced in the latest Golf . This doesn’t work very well. Still, there’s decent space up front and visibility is okay – even if the rear window is a bit small. That said, adult passengers will find the second row a bit tight for space. The roof slopes slightly so taller people will struggle to get completely comfortable, while legroom is also a bit limited. You get 438 litres of storage capacity in the boot and the load lip is quite small. The Taigo’s boot is larger than what you'll find in the Kia XCeed , SEAT Arona and Peugeot 2008 , but the Ford Puma is a bit more spacious. You can also fold the rear seats down to be almost flat and open up even more storage space. VW has changed its trim line-up across its models, so with the Taigo there’s only three you need to choose from – Life, Style and R-Line. You get decent equipment levels across all three, with R-Line giving you the sportiest finish both inside and out. You get a choice of two engines, both of which are petrol. The 1.0-litre three-cylinder comes with two power options – 95hp or 110hp – while the four-cylinder 1.5-litre is only offered with 150hp. You can have manual or automatic transmissions across the line-up, apart from the top-end power option that can only be had with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. Choosing the 110hp will give you more than enough power to work with, while the six-speed manual transmission is smooth and easy to use. The automatic is okay, but just be wary of it being jerky on getaway. When you get out on the road, the Taigo feels stable and secure – but if you’re after an exciting and invigorating experience, you may want to look elsewhere. The suspension soaks up the majority of bumps on the road well, with only the largest ones making an impact on the cabin, especially on the 17-inch wheels. Around town, the Taigo has light steering to make skipping in and out of traffic very easy. It’s compact enough for most spaces too, even the smallest ones in car parks. Then out on the motorway, it’s very easy to live with, as there’s only a slight wind whistle from the roof rails and wing mirrors. Tyre noise can be intrusive on larger wheels though. Even though it isn’t the most exciting, the Volkswagen Taigo is a capable compact crossover at the more affordable end of the market. Some of the interior finish might not be the best, but the overall quality is more than good enough for most. If you’re interested in this affordable coupe-styled SUV, why not check out the latest Volkswagen Taigo deals on carwow, where you can see how much you can save on a new car. You can also check out the latest used VW Taigo stock as well as browsing other used Volkswagen deals . You can also sell your car online through carwow. How much is the Volkswagen Taigo? How much is the Volkswagen Taigo? The small SUV class is packed with options, many of them VW Group products. The VW Taigo is placed like an SUV-shaped Tetris block in-between the slightly cheaper T-Cross and marginally pricier T-Roc, each one offering incrementally more kit and engine options than the last. The Skoda Kamiq and SEAT Arona (two more VW Group products) undercut the Taigo, although they are slightly less well-equipped as standard. Offerings from other manufacturers include the stylish Mini Countryman and striking Toyota C-HR , both cost a fair bit more than the Taigo but are pitched as more upmarket alternatives. The Ford Puma and Peugeot 2008 are similarly specced and come within a few hundred pounds of the Taigo’s base price. Clearly, there’s no shortage of choice here, the Taigo differentiates itself with its unique (at this price) coupe-like styling and its decent spec sheet. Pick the base Life trim with the 108hp engine for the best value, or the Style trim for a bit of extra kit. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort The Taigo is easy to drive in town and feels composed on winding roads, just don’t expect an exciting driving experience Thanks to its compact dimensions and good visibility, the Taigo feels perfectly at home zipping into gaps in the traffic. The firm suspension doesn’t harm the ride quality, with the Taigo taking most bumps and dips into its stride. The small rear window can make it tricky to gauge the distance of obstacles during parking, but standard surround parking sensors and park assist will help you avoid any parking scrapes. You also get traffic jam assist and autonomous emergency braking on all trims, with hill start assist taking the stress out of pulling off on sharp inclines. The Taigo is a consummate cruiser, offering a good view out for the driver and coming standard with adaptive cruise control , lane change assist and a driver fatigue alert system. There is also a semi-automated Travel Assist system which works in conjunction with a lane keeping system. There’s not much wind or road noise, although the larger 18-inch wheels (optional on Style and R-Line trims) do transmit a bit of tyre noise into the cabin. The Taigo feels safe and planted around a twisty road. The firm suspension limits body roll, and there’s plenty of grip from the tyres around corners. But even in the sportiest R-Line trim, this doesn’t translate into a particularly exciting driving experience. The Ford Puma and Peugeot 2008 offer a lot more driving enjoyment down a country road. Space and practicality Space and practicality Passenger space is impressive considering the Volkswagen Taigo's small size, though that cool sloping rear roofline does impinge on rear headroom The Taigo feels spacious in the front; the steering wheel and driver’s seat offer plenty of tweaking so you can get your driving position just right. Both front seats have height adjustment and lumbar support, and there’s a decent amount of storage space as well. The door bins will take larger water bottles, and there’s space for two coffee cups in the centre console, although the movable armrest can block access to them in its forwardmost setting. A slot in the dashboard ahead of the gear lever offers wireless charging for your phone, and there’s a smallish glove box for items you would like to keep out of sight. Space in the rear is decent if you aren’t particularly tall, but that sloping roofline will have loftier heads rubbing the headlining. The centre rear seat is also narrower than the outer two, with a pronounced bump in the footwell hindering leg room. A couple of teenagers or shorter adults should fit fine, but there are more spacious small SUVs out there if you need to transport a trio of adults in the rear on a regular basis. Passengers in the back row get access to a set of USB ports to charge their devices and two small door bins as well as front seatback pockets for tablets or books. The Taigo may sacrifice a bit of space in the name of style, but it’s not as much as you’d think. Its 440 litres of boot space is actually quite competitive here. The more conventionally-styled VW T-Cross has just 15 litres more, and the T-Roc offers only five litres of additional luggage room. It edges out the Peugeot 2008 (434 litres), Kia XCeed (426 litres) and the SEAT Arona (400 litres), and if you fold the seats down you get a flat load space. It's only beaten by the Ford Puma, which has 456 litres to offer thanks to an additional section under the floor. There’s no adjustable boot floor, but there’s only a very minimal load lip so it isn’t really missed. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories The Taigo has a well laid-out interior, although it’s more functional than stylish and some trim could be of a higher quality The VW Taigo is offered in Life, Style and R-Line trims; there are some variations in seat coverings but the majority of finishes are in black and dark grey, with a few silver flashes on the steering-wheel and door handles to lift the sombre mood. All trims are offered with an 8.0-inch infotainment screen which comes with DAB digital radio, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, as well as sat nav on the top two trims. There are a few touch-sensitive shortcut buttons running along either side of the screen. It’s a responsive system, with clear graphics, although some functions can be hard to access while on the move. The base Life model makes do with physical rotary controllers for the climate control, where higher trims get a touch-sensitive panel with a sliding touchbar that is actually more frustrating to use. The base trim also gets an 8.0-inch digital driver display, while the other versions get a larger 10.25-inch version. Both offer decent configurability and give the cabin an upmarket feel that helps to distract from the sections of hard and cheap-looking plastics dotted around the cabin. There is a brace of USB-C sockets in the front, allowing you to charge mobile devices while on the move. MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax The Taigo is offered with two petrol engines in three power outputs. The base offering is a 94hp 1.0-litre turbocharged petrol that is paired with a five-speed manual and is good for a claimed consumption figure of 51.4mpg and 123g/km of CO2 emissions. It is nippy enough around town and will get from 0-62mph in 11.1-seconds, matching the Peugeot 2008 as well as other VW Group products equipped with the same engine, such as the SEAT Arona and VW T-Cross. The 109hp 1.0-litre engine is the sweet-spot in the range. It can be had with a six-speed manual or seven-speed dual-clutch automatic and will deliver up to 52.3mpg in manual guise. It is a bit quicker to the 62mph mark, but its main appeal is that it feels stronger during overtaking and on the motorway. The automatic uses a bit more fuel at 47.9mpg but is worth it if you spend a lot of your commute in traffic. These figures once again match the Arona and T-Cross with the same engine, although the punchy 129hp 1.2-litre engine in the Peugeot 2008 is slightly quicker and more frugal. The Style and R-Line trims can also be specified with the 148hp 1.5-litre turbocharged petrol engine. Paired exclusively with the seven-speed dual-clutch automatic, it gets from 0-62mph in a quick 8.3 seconds, which is faster than the 153hp Ford Puma, although its 46.3mpg figure is marginally worse. All models are front-wheel-drive here; VW’s T-Roc is available with all-wheel-drive but that trim costs significantly more than even the priciest Taigo. There aren’t any hybrid options in the Taigo range, although the lower initial cost and still decent fuel economy of the entry-level petrol engines should still result in affordable running costs. Safety and security Safety and security The VW Taigo received a full five-star rating when it underwent Euro NCAP testing in 2022. It did very well in the adult occupant test, scoring 94%, as well as the child occupant test where it achieved 84%. These results put it among the safest small SUVs on sale today. Standard equipment on all Taigo trims includes adaptive cruise control, autonomous emergency braking, park assist with surround parking sensors, lane change assist and travel assist – a semi-automated driving assistance system. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems The VW Taigo is a relatively new model, however it shares a lot of its componentry with other VW Group products, so long term reliability should be good. It comes with a rather average three-year/60,000-mile warranty, this can be extended from around £140 for the two smaller engine options. Fixed and flexible service packages are available, with the fixed option suiting those that frequently do short journeys, and the flexible schedule more suitable for those that do longer distances at low engine loads. The fixed servicing plan will require a service to be carried out every 9,300 miles or 12 months, whichever occurs first. The flexible plan requires a minor service every 12 months or 10,000 miles, and a major service every 24 months or 20,000 miles. Prices vary depending on the model."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/volkswagen/touareg-r,Volkswagen Touareg R Review & Prices,"€97,052",6/10,new,"Is the Volkswagen Touareg R a good car? Is the Volkswagen Touareg R a good car? The Volkswagen Touareg R is the hottest version of the German manufacturer’s large SUV, the VW Touareg . It’s the most expensive Volkswagen you can buy - even beating out a fully-specced up ID Buzz - and as such, VW’s thrown the kitchen sink at it in terms of technology. If the regular Touareg is like an iPhone - posh, premium and feature-packed - then the Touareg R is like the iPhone Pro Max. Bigger, pricier, and stuffed full of even more tech, whether you actually need it or not. The ‘R’ badge is reserved for VW’s most powerful products - you’ll find it on the Golf , T-Roc SUV and Arteon fastback. But the Touareg R is the only one of these to be a plug-in hybrid - putting it into contention with a huge number of posh plug-in SUVs from the Porsche Cayenne E-Hybrid to the Volvo XC90 to our favourite, the BMW X5 50e . Inside, you wouldn’t know the Touareg was intended to be a sporty product. Though the ‘R’ badge is sprinkled liberally across the software and on the steering wheel, the Touareg R’s seats are large, comfortable and supportive, and the colour palette is a muted blue rather than the aggressive red of some more overtly macho offerings. It’s a really nice place to sit - Volkswagen hasn’t tried to squeeze a third row of seats in, so there’s palatial room for five and a big boot too. Up front, a 15-inch touchscreen infotainment system controls most of the car’s functions through a sensible and easy-to-operate interface. The same can’t be said for the touch-sensitive controls on the steering wheel, though. The Touareg R’s plug-in hybrid engine produces a beefy 462hp, good for the benchmark 0-62mph sprint in 5.1 seconds. That’s just 0.4 seconds behind what the Golf R can manage, making it highly impressive for such a large SUV. However, the Touareg’s sheer weight and size mean that it doesn’t feel very agile when you’re cornering. It’s more of a blunt instrument than a precision scalpel, and both the BMW X5 and Porsche Cayenne are much more satisfying to drive. The Touareg’s air suspension does mean it’s very comfortable over bumps, but that shouldn’t really be the defining feature on a car that’s badged as a special performance model. Compared to the X5 and Cayenne, the Touareg’s plug-in hybrid system is a bit lacking, too. It’ll only do an official 31 miles on a charge - compared with around 50 for the other two - and that means it’s less useful for lowering your fuel bills, and attracts higher rates of tax too. Considering the Touareg R is pricier than both of those cars, yet does without the attraction of a truly premium badge, you might find that a lower-tier Touareg suits you better. A plug-in hybrid is available on the lower variants, too - just with less power and without the sporty pretensions. But if a giant R-badged Touareg suits you, check out the best Volkswagen Touareg R deals right here on Carwow. You can also browse used Volkswagen Touaregs , or other used Volkswagens - and remember that when the time comes for car-changing, you can sell your car online through Carwow too. How much is the Volkswagen Touareg R? How much is the Volkswagen Touareg R? With a starting price of over £80,000 the Touareg R is more expensive than either a Porsche Cayenne E-Hybrid or a BMW X5 50e. Neither of those cars paints itself as a true sports SUV, and they’re both slower than the Touareg - but they are significantly cheaper to run thanks to better plug-in hybrid systems, and are actually nicer to drive day-to-day too. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort Comfortable, quiet and relaxing - just what you want from an £80,000 sports SUV? In town The Touareg R’s engine pairs a 3.0-litre V6 petrol with an electric motor and battery pack. It’s capable of an official 31 miles (more like 22-ish in the real world) on electric power alone, during which it’s a pleasure to drive around town. It’s smooth, silent and more than powerful enough to keep up with traffic right up to the faster roads. Even when the engine cuts in the silence isn’t spoiled, as it’s well insulated and when you do hear some engine noise come through it’s not an unpleasant tone. The Touareg R has air suspension too, which deals really well with bumps and potholes - though the massive wheels (22 inches!) do put a sharper edge on speed bumps and the like. On the motorway Obviously with so much power on tap the Touareg R makes mincemeat of short sliproads or snappy overtakes. The benchmark 0-62mph sprint takes just 5.1 seconds, and the added grunt of the electric motor means that power is relentless right up to the legal limit and beyond. When you’re cruising, wind noise is impressively quiet, and the engine’s almost silent. Only the road roar from those massive 22-inch wheels disturbs the silence, though it’s far from noisy. The Touareg R’s air suspension makes for a really cushioned, pillowy ride even on poorly surfaced motorways. On a twisty road A twisting B-road does show the limitations of the Touareg R. There’s loads of tech - you can put the suspension into sport mode to firm it up, and there’s an active anti-roll system that helps to stop it leaning like a ship in bends. However, there’s no disguising the car’s size and weight, and combined with steering that isn’t particularly satisfying or accurate it means there’s no real reward to be had in pressing on through the bends. The gearbox - which is totally unobtrusive in regular operation - is a little recalcitrant when you’re pressing on, occasionally changing up when you don’t want it to. You can take manual control, but even then it’s a bit unresponsive. While it’s impressively fast, it’s not very much fun - in contrast to other cars that wear the R badge, which feel significantly more agile. A BMW X5 50e or Porsche Cayenne E-Hybrid, though they may lack the Touareg R’s outright pace, feel much lighter on their feet and have more accurate steering, making them more fun on a good road. Space and practicality Space and practicality Loads of interior space, but only five seats All versions of the Touareg are five-seater, despite the car’s imposing size. While this isn’t necessarily a bad thing, it does mean you don’t get the versatility of a BMW X5 (where a third row is an optional extra). VW’s made the most of the ample space available to it, though, and you’ll really be able to stretch out in the Touareg R. The front seats aren’t particularly sporty - this does mean they’re not super supportive in the corners, but it also means that drivers of all shapes and sizes will be able to get comfortable without feeling like they’re being hemmed in. The seats adjust electrically, of course, and there’s loads of travel in them as well as in the adjustable steering wheel. Storage up front is okay - there’s a pair of cupholders (with a smaller one in between them to hold a can of energy drink securely) and a big cubby under the central armrest, plus a large glovebox and reasonable door bins. Ahead of the gear selector you’ll find a deep storage area with a wireless phone charging pad. Space in the back seats A six-foot adult can really stretch out in the rear of the Touareg. There’s ample legroom and headroom, even with the panoramic sunroof eating up a little bit of vertical space. It’s even wide enough for three adults to sit across the rear bench, with enough shoulder room that they won’t be suffering for space. The middle seat is wide and flat, making it plenty comfortable enough, and while there’s a slight hump in the floor it’s wide rather than high - so the middle passenger’s feet have somewhere to go. Rear passengers get big door bins, a wide central armrest (if there’s no middle passenger), plus a couple of USB ports and their own set of climate controls. Boot space The Touareg R’s boot is pretty hefty at 655 litres - smaller than the 800+ litres that other versions of the Touareg have, but the space is eaten up by components in the hybrid system. It’s on par with the 645 litres offered by a Cayenne e-Hybrid and well ahead of the BMW X5 plug-in hybrid’s 500 litre space. The electric tailgate reveals a space that’s seriously wide, and there’s room underneath the floor to store your charging cable too. The seats fold flat via handles in the rear, and they go in a 40:20:40 split so you can still carry two passengers and have room for long, thin items. And if you’re struggling to reach right to the back, a press of a button will have the Touareg squat down on its air suspension to help you reach. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories Almost all screen, but better to use than many of VWs other offerings When the pre-facelift Touareg was launched in 2018, its 15-inch touchscreen display seemed unbelievably massive. How the times change, and in 2024 it feels pretty normal - and even a little bit workaday compared with alternatives offering screens that run the full width of the dash. Still, it’s a setup that works notably better than many of VW’s other cars. The screen is bright, crisp and responsive, and instead of being perched on top of the dash like in the company’s electric vehicles, it’s set flush into the fascia and notably lower. This makes it much easier to operate on the move, as your hand doesn’t have to wobble about in midair and you can rest your thumb on the ledge underneath as you operate it. It’s still far from perfect - the climate controls can be frustrating to operate through a touchscreen, and while there are a few shortcut keys down the side of the display they’re touch-sensitive too and therefore don’t offer any feedback. Volkswagen’s also fitted its touch-sensitive haptic controls to the steering wheel - these are incredibly frustrating, and can be difficult to use without taking your eyes off the road, which somewhat defeats the object of having buttons on the wheel in the first place… The cabin is quite dark, but bright blue stitching and detailing does lift it somewhat. So too does the ambient lighting, which is extensive and multi-configurable - endless fun to play with. Quality, meanwhile, is tip-top - everything you touch is swathed in solid-feeling materials, though a BMW X5 does feel notably more luxurious if not necessarily better-built. To match the Touareg, you’d need to specify the extended leather package on a Porsche Cayenne e-Hybrid. MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax The Touareg R officially claims to do 122.8mpg. If you’re familiar with plug-in hybrids you’ll know that number is something of a pipe dream, and is highly dependent on the type of journeys you do. If you plug in every night, and stay within the Touareg R’s real-world electric range of around 22 miles, then yes - you’ll use very little petrol, though you’ll see a hit on your electricity bill. Don’t plug in, meanwhile, and a Touareg with a flat battery settles at around 33mpg on a cruise, or rather less if you’re giving it the beans. Still not bad for a car of this size, but less than a BMW X5 plug-in hybrid will do. The Touareg R’s official CO2 emissions are 54g/km, which tips it over the magic 50g/km threshold to unlock cheaper company car tax. As a result your bills will be a fair bit heftier, though much cheaper than they would be with a plain petrol or diesel. Safety and security Safety and security When tested in 2018, the regular Volkswagen Touareg scored a full five-star rating from crash test body Euro NCAP. It’s fair to expect the current model would still perform well, though newer alternatives may offer slightly better crash protection. It gets more safety systems than any other VW, though, with sensors and systems galore to help protect you in a crash as well as stop it happening in the first place. Particularly notable are the IQ Light headlights - a Matrix LED system that’s among the best we’ve ever used. There’s even Night Vision available, as well as Volkswagen’s Travel Assist providing assisted driving features at speeds up to 130mph. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems The Touareg is one of Volkswagen’s more reliable cars, with fewer complaints than many of its models, especially the electric ones. Volkswagen’s overall reputation isn’t fantastic though, finishing 27th out of 32 manufacturers in the 2023 Driver Power owner satisfaction survey. You get a distinctly average warranty offering with the Touareg R, too - just three years and 60,000 miles of cover."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/volkswagen/golf-r,Volkswagen Golf R Review & Prices,"€54,317",9/10,new,"Is the Volkswagen Golf R a good car? Is the Volkswagen Golf R a good car? The Volkswagen Golf R is the halo version of the ubiquitous hatchback ’s range, and a 2024 update brought much-needed improvements to the infotainment system, as well as a welcome dose of extra performance. The R is in distinguished company, with all-wheel drive hot hatch alternatives including the Audi S3 , BMW M135 and Mercedes-AMG A35 , with less refined, more driver-focused options such as the Honda Civic Type R and Toyota GR Yaris also on the radar. If the standard Golf is a korma then the R – with the extra power that comes as part of the latest update – is like ordering a vindaloo, then sprinkling chilli flakes on top. The updated version of the Mk8 Volkswagen Golf R – known as the 8.5 – gets more aggressive styling than the regular Golf, but the update also brings with it new bumper designs, LED headlights and an illuminated VW badge up front. The jury’s still out on that one. Inside there’s one key change. The infotainment system is much-improved, with a bigger display, faster processing and redesigned interface that’s more intuitive to use. It’s still some way off the best alternatives, and we still encountered frustrations with smartphone connectivity, for example, but it’s much better than before. Sadly the infuriating touch-sensitive steering wheel buttons, dropped from the rest of the Golf range, remain in the R. Outside of the on-board tech the Golf R’s cabin is a pleasant place to sit. You get comfortable yet figure-hugging sports seats and a chunky R-specific steering wheel with larger shift paddles, while space and storage are decent. You get some nice sporty touches, such as a suede-like material on the doors and seats, blue stitching and R-specific displays, but on the whole the cabin doesn’t feel quite up to the quality of other circa-£45k hot hatches such as the Audi S3. The Golf R loses out a little to alternatives in the practicality stakes, with only the S3 having a smaller boot capacity. At 341 litres the Golf R’s boot will be fine for most, but a Honda Civic Type R should be top of your shopping list of boot capacity is important. There’s also the Golf R Estate if you want more space. While there are a few pros and cons in terms of practicality and technology, there’s very little to complain about once on the road. The Golf R is one of the most engaging hot hatches to drive and its all-wheel drive system contributes to it being an incredibly capable car in corners. There’s loads of grip, and with all that power you shoot out of corners full of confidence. Importantly, it’s also more fun to drive than its predecessor. The fun factor is helped a bit by the extra power on offer. The 2.0-litre engine makes 333hp, up from 320hp, and has an official 0-62mph time of 4.6 seconds. However, we matched this in damp conditions, demonstrating how rapid this family hatchback really is. There are some compromises, with the suspension being a bit less comfortable than a regular Golf when driving around town, and you get more road noise at motorway speeds, too. These feel like fair concessions for a car that’s so good on a twisty stretch of Tarmac. If you’re looking for a new hot hatch, check out the latest Volkswagen Golf R deals on Carwow. You can also get a great price on a used Golf R , as well as other used Volkswagens , from our network of trusted dealers. When it’s time to sell your current car , Carwow can help with that, too. How much is the Volkswagen Golf R? How much is the Volkswagen Golf R? With prices starting around £44,000, that sounds like a lot of money for a Volkswagen Golf, but it actually puts it right in line with powerful premium alternatives. There’s not much in it compared with the BMW M135, Audi S3 and Mercedes -AMG A35, though the latter two being a fraction more expensive. The Honda Civic Type R is the priciest of the bunch, starting at over £50,000 – it’s not as plush inside, but feels like a much more focused performance car. A potential issue with the Golf R is that it’s easy to push that price up with a few optional extras. If you opt for the adjustable suspension system and the ‘R Performance Pack’, which increases the top speed and adds a drift mode, you’re looking at about £2,700 extra before you’ve even considered items such as a panoramic sunroof or the Lapiz Blue paint, which are another £2,000-plus combined. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort An absolute riot on a country road, but it’s less refined than the standard Golf the rest of the time At lower speeds around town, the Volkswagen Golf R can’t quite hide its performance-focused credentials. In our test car, which had the optional adaptive suspension, you could feel poor roads bump and jiggle the car around even in its most comfortable setting. Despite this, it’s not unbearable, and otherwise the R feels just as simple and uneventful to drive as any other Golf. Visibility is good and the car is a decent size for town driving, so width restrictors aren’t too stressful. Standard assistance kit includes a rear-view camera to make parking easier, and a remote parking system if you don’t fancy trying yourself. It’s a bit of a shame you have to pay extra for a 360-degree camera, though. At higher speeds, the suspension copes much better with bumps, so it’s pretty comfortable at motorway speeds. You do have to contend with a bit more road noise than a regular Golf, though. Still, with all that power on tap and an automatic gearbox that’s quick to respond when you accelerate quickly, overtakes and slip roads are fuss free. Good news also comes in the form of standard-fit adaptive cruise control , which keeps your distance to the car in front and takes some of the strain out of motorway driving. That’s an optional extra on the BMW M135. It’s twisty roads where the Volkswagen Golf R excels. Grip has never been a Golf R problem, but arguably, fun has. Its predecessor was clearly capable on a twisty road, but never felt the most engaging, something that has been addressed with this update. You have faith in the car to grip in the middle of the corner, and then when you accelerate out the tyres hook up and catapult you forward. The all-wheel drive system feels rear-biased, which makes it feel more sporty, and the suspension soaks up bumps well so you don’t feel like you’re bouncing around. As a result, the Golf R is now one of the more fun all-wheel drive hot hatch options. The only way to really beat it is to spend more on the (front-wheel drive) Honda Civic Type R, but that comes with other compromises to interior quality and everyday driving sensibilities. Space and practicality Space and practicality Interior space and storage is pretty good, but the boot is smaller than most alternatives The driving position is spot on and it’s easy to get comfortable, with a good range of adjustability in the seat and steering wheel. As a pricey, range-topping model it does feel a bit stingy that you don’t get fully electric seat movement, though. Storage is decent, with useful door bins and a couple of cup holders that can grip large and small drinks. There’s a smartphone charging pad under the main screen, which has a cover to hide your phone and avoid distractions. It’s fairly spacious in the back too, with decent kneeroom and headroom, which means four six-footers can sit without compromising anyone’s legroom. Fitting three across the back is a bit tight though, and the middle seat feels rather perched. Getting a child seat in is easy because the ISOFIX points are clearly marked, the doors open nice and wide, and you have space for a bulky child seat. Although the regular Golf is bang on par with its Audi and BMW equivalents, the Golf R’s boot actually loses some capacity to make way for some of the mechanical bits that make it so much fun to drive. As a result you get a 341-litre capacity, 40 litres down on the regular car, though this is essentially because of reduced underfloor storage, so the main luggage area is the same. The Audi S3 has the same problem, but loses even more space, so it’s smaller than the Golf R at 325 litres. However, the Mercedes-AMG A35 (370 litres), BMW M135 (380 litres) and Honda Civic Type R (410 litres) all have bigger boots, which can make all the difference if you’re trying to squeeze a buggy in. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories Cool sporty design touches and an improved infotainment system are welcome, but there are still technology-related frustrations abound The Volkswagen Golf’s interior has received plenty of justified criticism since its 2020 introduction, but the 2024 update has brought with it at least one welcome change to address this. The main talking point was the screen, which has been completely overhauled with a new 12.9-inch display. It runs much improved software, both aesthetically and operationally, with crisp graphics and lots of customisable shortcut buttons to make it much easier to use. This is coupled with the climate sliders that sit below now being backlit, so you can actually find them at night. It’s much, much better, but still far from the best, and we encountered smartphone connectivity issues, not for the first time in a modern Volkswagen product. Sadly, while the rest of the updated Golf range ditched the awful touch-sensitive steering wheel controls for proper physical buttons, the R keeps the old units because they have a unique drive mode button. They’re awkward to use, and you’ll constantly brush them as you drive, turning up the volume or the heated steering wheel in every bend. Still, the digital instrument display mimics old-school dials and is generally easy to use. You get R-specific graphics and functions to add to the theatre, too. A head-up display is a paid extra, which again, feels a bit stingy at this price point. Other upgrades for the R model make it feel suitably sporty and a cut above the rest of the range, particularly the bucket seats, which look racy but are comfortable and have a lovely suede-like upholstery. There’s also blue trim and some blue ambient lighting to remind you this is the R model. MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax The Volkswagen Golf R gets a 2.0-litre, four-cylinder turbocharged petrol engine that makes 333hp, which is a 13hp increase over the old model. That’s not a huge amount of difference, but it does feel a touch more eager than before. Impressively, that makes the Golf R the joint most powerful of the similarly priced hot hatches you might be considering. The Audi S3 has the same 333hp output, while the Honda Civic Type R isn’t far behind on 329hp. The Mercedes-AMG A35 gets 306hp and the BMW M135 has 300hp. Officially you’ll get from 0-62mph in 4.6 seconds, but our timing gear measured the 0-60mph sprint at 4.4 seconds in the wet, which is very impressive. Top speed is limited to 155mph, but if you’re planning to use the car on track or regularly hit the German autobahn, you can unlock 168mph by purchasing the R Performance Pack. We hovered around 30mpg in normal driving, which is respectably close to the official figures of 34.9mpg, but expect that to drop quickly if you’re enjoying the performance on offer. We saw just 17mpg during filming… As a performance car, the Volkswagen Golf R’s emissions put it into one of the higher bands for first-year Vehicle Excise Duty , and the purchase price means you’ll have to pay extra in years two to six, too. It’s also not an ideal option for a company car ; you’d be better off looking at hybrid or electric vehicles, such as the Hyundai Ioniq 5 N . Safety and security Safety and security The Volkswagen Golf R gets the same Euro NCAP safety rating as the normal car, which means it has the full five stars overall. Adult and child occupant protection scores are pretty good at 88% and 87% respectively. It’s a bit of a shame you have to pay extra for curtain, side and centre airbags, though. Standard assistance kit includes adaptive cruise control, which can also take control in stop/start traffic, as well as a lane-keeping assistant . You also get tech to help avoid oncoming cars and another system warns you if you’re about to reverse into vehicles passing behind the car. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems The Volkswagen Golf came a miserable 50th out of 50 cars in the 2024 Driver Power owner satisfaction survey, with most complaints centred around the infotainment system and lack of physical controls. On top of this, Volkswagen overall came 29th out of 32 manufacturers, showing there’s plenty of work to be done. Volkswagen’s warranty is in line with most manufacturers (though certainly on the low end overall) at three years, with unlimited mileage in the first two years and a limit of 60,000 miles in the third.

https://www.carwow.co.uk/volkswagen/touran,Volkswagen Touran Review & Prices,"€48,028",7/10,new,"Is the Volkswagen Touran a good car? Is the Volkswagen Touran a good car? The Volkswagen Touran doesn’t look exciting at all, but the payoffs for its high roofline and slab-sides are lots of interior space and huge doors for great access – making it one of the most practical family cars you can buy. It also has seven seats, and those big rear doors mean anyone with a degree of flexibility can access the back row, which – unusually for a seven-seater – can accommodate an adult so long as they’re under six-feet tall. That means there’s plenty of room back there for kids. The middle row, meanwhile, has three individual seats that slide backwards and forwards, so adults will have no trouble getting comfortable. Both front seats are height adjustable too. The Volkswagen Touran only has a 137-litre boot with all seven seats in place, which is barely enough space for a weekly shop – so if you need to carry seven people and their things then the larger Volkswagen Sharan will be a better bet. However, the Volkswagen Touran’s boot grows to a whopping 937 litres when the car’s in five-seater mode. Factor in the 47 separate smaller storage areas that are dotted around the interior and few cars this size can compete with the Touran’s practicality. You’re not going to buy a Volkswagen Touran on account of its interior style. It has none of the flamboyance of the now discontinued Citroen Grand C4 Spacetourer , but it does have a straightforward layout and build quality that feels like it’ll stand up to years of use. A lot of thought has gone into the design – simple mechanisms make the seats really ease to fold, the cup holders have a sprung grip that wraps around energy drinks as easily as they hold a can of coke, and the picnic tables on the backs of the front seats have a ratchet function that holds them in place even if you lean on them. These are the things you’ll appreciate for years to come. The Volkswagen Touran is a safe car too. It scored five stars when Euro NCAP crash-tested it in 2015, but it’s worth upgrading from S to SE models and above just to get automatic emergency braking fitted as standard – it’ll reduce the chance of low-speed crashes. The Volkswagen Touran’s once broad selection of engine options have been whittled down to just one 148hp turbocharged petrol unit. It’s perky and efficient though, and is available in manual or automatic form. You’ll be surprised at how well the Volkswagen Touran drives. Although it looks like a van, it doesn’t feel like one – in corners it feels like a taller VW Golf . It doesn’t lean much going around corners and the light steering makes it a doddle to park and easy to use around town. In fact, ‘easy to use’ pretty much sums up the Volkswagen Touran. It does exactly what it says on the tin – it’s built to carry people comfortably and easily, and it doesn’t let frivolities such as sexy styling and sporty driving dynamics steer it off course from its main objective of being family friendly. How much is the Volkswagen Touran? How much is the Volkswagen Touran? The seven-seater MPV population has been in slow decline in recent years, and leaves the Volkswagen Touran with few direct alternatives aside from the Ford S-Max , which comes in quite a bit pricier and is now offered only as a self-charging hybrid. Van-based seven-seater MPVs like the Vauxhall Combo Life , Citroen E-Berlingo and Peugeot Rifter offer even more interior space, but these are only available in purely electric form, something that may not suit everyone just yet. Prices are largely comparable to the Touran, though and running costs will be much lower. Of course, larger SUVs like the Peugeot 5008 , Skoda Kodiaq and SEAT Tarraco are now the more popular route to seven-seater motoring. They offer a more modern design, but aren’t always as practical and tend to cost more than the Touran. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort Its boxy looks may suggest otherwise, but the VW Touran is good to drive. It may not be quite as sharp as the best SUVs, or have much off-roading ability, but it’s one of the best family-friendly offerings around The Touran offers a commanding driving position, thanks to its height, and the squared off extremities aid parking manoeuvres. You get front and rear parking sensors as standard, handy for those really tight parking bays. Autonomous emergency braking is another useful driver aid when driving around crowded city streets. The ride is comfortable over most surfaces, and there’s none of that slackness to responses that you sometimes get in large family vehicles . The Dual-clutch DSG automatic gearbox works well around town, although the manual is a great choice too. The refined and quiet interior makes the Touran a great long-distance cruiser. Large windows and plenty of interior space will keep the passengers happy, and the 148hp turbocharged engine has no trouble maintaining speed up hills, even when fully loaded. A driver fatigue detection system is standard, as well as adaptive cruise control and lane change assist. The Touran is based on the Golf hatchback platform, and it feels much like the smaller car when hustling around tight and winding roads. It offers plenty of grip and lean around sharp bends is well contained. The Ford S-Max also feels sportier than you might expect, but its ride quality can’t quite match the Touran. Space and practicality Space and practicality There’s plenty of passenger space in all three rows, with plenty of clever storage solutions. Boot space is rather limited with a full complement of passengers, but folding the rear rows down reveals a massive loading area Getting comfortable in the Touran should be a doddle. The driver gets a rake and reach adjustable steering-wheel, and there’s height adjustment and lumbar support for both front seats. There’s a centre armrest that folds up to reveal a large storage area, and two cup holders are placed between the front seats. The door bins and glovebox are huge, capable of taking large water bottles or handbags. There’s a storage slot ahead of the gear lever for your phone and plenty of other storage spots dotted around the cabin for things like keys, glasses and wallets. There’s even a storage bin in the roof just behind the rearview mirror. The second row of seats offers tons of leg and head room, and instead of a narrow and uncomfortable centre seat, you get three individual chairs and no irritating hump in the floor so getting in and out is easy, too. All three chairs have ISOFIX mountings, and the wide-opening doors allow you to get bulky baby seats in without breaking into a sweat. The door bins are huge in the back, too, and there’s a pair of foldout picnic tables installed into the back of the front seats. Unlike in some alternatives, a handy ratchet function prevents them from collapsing when pressed hard. The third row is inevitably compromised, being a bit trickier to climb back into, but the two rearmost seats will still accommodate most adults under six feet without issue. A pair of ISOFIX mountings are also provided if you feel the need for some distance between you and your offspring. If you fill every one of the Touran’s seven seats, you’ll be left with just 137-litres of luggage space. That’s not a lot. Even a VW Up! offers 251 litres behind its rear seats. If you don’t need the rearmost seats, then you can fold them flat to increase your load space to a frankly huge 937 litres. For those trips to IKEA, you can fold both rear rows flat to get a massive 1,875 litres. The Ford S-Max offers even more, with 285/965/2,020 litres in those configurations, and seven-seater SUV such as the SEAT Tarraco offers 230/700/1,775 litres, which serves to highlight just how versatile MPVs are. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories The Volkswagen Touran has a no-nonsense approach to its interior. Everything is logically laid out and material quality is good throughout. It’s missing the design flair that you find in some alternatives, though The VW Touran has been around for quite a while, but thanks to regular updates the interior still looks suitably modern, and an 8.0-inch digital driver display and touchscreen infotainment system are standard fitment. Trim levels consist of the SE, SEL, SE Family and R-Line, with not much separating the first three alternatives, pricewise. That makes the SEL a rather tempting buy, offering three-zone climate control, a larger 10.25-inch digital cockpit and the option of a Deep Mocha leather interior. SE Family models make do with the standard digital cockpit but add a dual panoramic sunroof which greatly enhances the cabin ambiance. The R-Line adds larger 18-inch wheels and some cosmetic updates, but we’d save our money and opt for one of the other trims considering the intended use of the Touran. Features like keyless entry, the larger digital cockpit, panoramic sunroof and Park Assist can be added to the lower trims if you prefer to mix and match the spec. The infotainment system isn’t the latest offering available, but that’s actually a good thing as it forgoes the irritating touch-sensitive climate controls for physical buttons which are far easier to operate. Sat nav is standard on all but the SE trim, but Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are included so you can just use your own navigation app if you prefer. SEL and R-Line trims also offer wireless App-Connect. Bluetooth connectivity and digital DAB radio are standard on all trims. MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax The Touran engine range now comprises just one 148hp 1.5-litre turbocharged petrol unit. It drives the front wheels through either a six-speed manual or seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission, and delivers between 40.9mpg and 42.8mpg depending on the trim level, with the economy figures are the same for both the manual and auto. CO2 emissions are between 150g/km and 157g/km. A 0-62mph time of 10.9-seconds is competitive with the 2.5-litre petrol hybrid in the Ford S-Max, but the Touran’s claimed fuel economy figure is slightly worse. The SEAT Tarraco SUV is fitted with the same 148hp engine in base trim as you find in the Touran, and both performance and fuel economy figures are largely similar. If your commute is made up mostly of short city trips then you may want to consider one of the van-based MPVs from Citroen, Peugeot or Vauxhall. They all come fitted with a 134hp electric motor and 50kW battery pack which offers around 170 miles between charges. With similar pricing and no road tax or ULEZ and congestion charges, the running costs should be far less than the petrol-only Touran. Safety and security Safety and security The VW Touran underwent Euro NCAP testing way back in 2015. It scored a full five-star rating, but the testing procedures have changed to such a degree that this rating has since expired. That said, the Touran has received a number of tweaks and updates over the years, getting a a package of additional standard safety systems that weren’t available at the time of its launch. The standard active and passive safety systems now include adaptive cruise control, a driver fatigue alert system, autonomous emergency braking, front and rear parking sensors and lane change assist. Optional extras include keyless entry, Park Assist and a rearview camera. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems The Touran has been on sale for quite some time, and owner reviews have found it to be a reliable vehicle overall. There have been 10 recalls for the Touran since it was launched, most occurring in the earlier years of production with no new recalls since 2020. A basic three-year/60,000-mile warranty is standard, with the option to extend it to four years and 75,000-miles or five years and 90,000-miles at additional cost. This is comparable to Ford’s warranty offering, but falls well short of what Hyundai and Kia offer. A VW service plan is available for £269 and covers the first two services of the vehicle. Payment can be done up front or over a 24-month period."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/volkswagen/golf,Volkswagen Golf Review & Prices,"€38,374",8/10,new,"Is the Volkswagen Golf a good car? Is the Volkswagen Golf a good car? It’s fair to say that the Volkswagen Golf defines the family hatchback - it’s the benchmark by which all of its alternatives such as the Ford Focus , Vauxhall Astra and Honda Civic are measured. At the same time, it’s posh enough that you could quite happily compare it to upmarket cars such as the BMW 1 Series or Audi A3 . The Golf is the Coca Cola or Heinz Ketchup of cars - it’s been the default choice for an astonishing amount of buyers in its five decades on sale. And just like coke or ketchup, while there may be alternatives or new players that offer something different - perhaps, in some situations, better - the default choice is still extremely good and hard to top. The current Golf is the Mk8 model, which was first launched in 2020. An update in 2024 took into account customer feedback and made myriad small tweaks and improvements, particularly to the interior and software. The exterior hasn’t had such a big makeover. The new headlights - full LED on all models - are smart, and on some versions joined by a light bar and even an illuminated VW logo. The taillights are slightly updated, too, and the bumpers have been redesigned. It’s still not what you’d call a particularly exciting-looking, but it is smart and inoffensive - which is more than you can say about the latest BMW 1 Series. Inside, the Golf still retains its trademark solid feel which has been an enduringly popular feature ever since the Mk4. For 2024, Volkswagen took in customer feedback, and as a result the new model replaces the old car’s touch-sensitive steering wheel buttons with a full range of physical switches. The infotainment’s had a serious refresh too, featuring far more user-friendly software, illuminated sliders underneath the screen for quick access to volume and temperature controls, and even the AI ChatGPT built in to answer questions that the native voice assistant can’t figure out. The Golf remains as practical as ever - that is to say, totally middle of the pack. There’s more room for rear passengers than you find in a Mercedes A-Class or BMW 1 Series, but a Skoda Octavia and Ford Focus are more capacious. The boot measures 381 litres, which is again firmly average, for a totally average-sized hatchback. If you need more room, the Golf Estate has an enormous boot and slightly more rear passenger space, while being usefully cheaper than the larger Volkswagen Passat. In contrast to most alternatives, which offer fewer and fewer engines as the years go on, the Golf is available with a huge range of different options. There’s a 1.5-litre petrol, with or without a mild hybrid system and available with two power outputs, with a 2.0-litre version on the way. There’s even a choice of two 2.0-litre diesel engines, perfect for milemunchers. Two plug-in hybrids complete the engine range - a normal model badged eHybrid and the sporty-looking GTE . A refreshed Golf GTI and Golf R will join the range later. Whichever engine you choose you can be assured of a relaxing journey - the Golf majors on its feeling of solidity, refinement and stability. No, it’s not as much fun to drive as a Ford Focus or BMW 1 Series when the road gets twisty, but it’s not too far off, especially if you choose one of the models with adjustable suspension. Higher-powered cars also get more sophisticated rear suspension that helps you corner more quickly and without so much lean. With so much choice in the range - six engine options, five trim levels (plus the standalone GTE) and a massive selection of optional extras, there is a Golf for pretty much anybody - but they’re all damn good cars.

Alternatively, check out offers on used models or sell your car through Carwow. How much is the Volkswagen Golf? How much is the Volkswagen Golf? The Golf is more expensive than rivals like the Ford Focus and mechanically-identical Skoda Octavia but it does come with more standard equipment than either. All versions of the Golf come with a multi-function digital display in place of old-fashioned conventional dials, you get parking sensors at the front and back, as well as active cruise control which can brake and accelerate the car automatically. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort The Volkswagen Golf is easy to drive in town, comfortable on the motorway and fun in bends, but it isn't the best at anything – it’s a jack of all trades but a master of none The Volkswagen Golf is easy to drive in town. You get good all-around visibility, light steering, a clutch pedal that isn’t too springy and brakes that are progressive, not snatchy. The manual gearbox is a little bit notchy, but there’s always the option to go for the seven-speed automatic. It shifts gear smoothly once you’re underway, but can be slightly jerky at slow speeds which you’ll notice when parking. Otherwise, the Golf is an easy car to park. All models come with progressive steering that has not much more than one turn lock-to-lock, front and rear parking sensors and the optional auto-park system can park the Golf in bays and perpendicular spaces. It can even nose you into gaps if it needs to. The Golf’s adjustable dampers are another option that’s worth considering. It gives the Volkswagen a surprisingly comfortable ride over poor surfaces like cobbles and potholes. A word of warning, though, only Golfs with 150hp or more get independent rear suspension that deals better with bumps than the standard setup. The Volkswagen Golf is very relaxing for a car this size when you get up to speed on the motorway with comfortable suspension and a quiet cabin that’s only spoiled by a little flutter of wind from around the wing mirrors. All models come with active cruise control that can accelerate and brake the car automatically. It works best when paired with the Golf's automatic gearbox, which means the car can come to a complete stop with no outside interference. Matrix LEDs are another option worth considering. They have multiple separate LEDs that can be controlled individually so they don’t blind other road users while keeping the area around them fully illuminated. Volkswagen has even managed to make the Golf fun to drive in corners. It grips well and putting the car in Sport mode makes the steering heavier, sharpens the throttle and (in cars with adjustable dampers) stiffens the suspension. Okay, so it’s not quite as engaging to drive as a Ford Focus, but it is a better package all around. Space and practicality Space and practicality The Volkswagen Golf is an easy car to get comfortable in and has a well-designed cabin with plenty of storage, although heated seats are an option on most of the range Getting a comfortable driving position is easy in the Volkswagen Golf. All models get height-adjustable front seats with lumbar adjustment and the steering wheel also has a wide range of adjustments for height and reach. Want your Golf to take the edge of winter? Then consider the winter pack which adds heated seats, a heated steering wheel, a quick clear heated windscreen and heated washer jet nozzles that won’t freeze. There’s not much wrong with the car’s interior storage. All models have large bins in each door – they’re felt-lined to stop things jiggling about – a decent-sized glovebox and a small storage space under the front-centre armrest. The cup holders are also well designed so that they can grip large and small drinks, while the vanity mirrors behind the sun visors are illuminated so you can see your face at night. There's plenty of room in the back of the Volkswagen Golf with decent knee room and headroom for six-footers thanks to the car’s boxy shape. The large rear windows also help make the car feel light and airy. Wedge three people into the back and the middle passenger will feel squished but, on the bright side, your outer passengers won’t find their heads get rammed into the roof like they would in a Toyota Corolla . The Volkswagen’s doors also open wider than the Toyota, which makes it easy to get a child seat lined up to the car’s clearly marked Isofix mounting points. The Volkswagen Golf has a 381-litre boot – a litre bigger than you get in an Audi A3 or BMW 1 Series (both 380 litres), although the BMW can swallow six carry-on suitcases while the shape of the Volkswagen’s boot limits it to five. The Toyota Corolla (361 litres) also falls behind, but the Honda Civic (410 litres) does best the Golf. On the upside, the Golf’s boot has plenty of features including shopping hooks and a ski hatch that lets you feed longer luggage through into the cabin. An adjustable boot floor is also standard with it set in its highest position, there’s no load lip to lift luggage over. It also means the boot floor remains flat when you fold down the back seats to reveal a total load capacity of 1,237 litres. That’s a bit bigger than the 1,200 litres found in both the Audi and the BMW. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories The Volkswagen Golf’s interior – with its big screens and limited conventional buttons – looks very modern but it’s less easy to use as a result The Golf’s interior came in for a lot of criticism when it launched in 2020 - mainly around its use of the central touchscreen for almost every function. That’s still the case after the 2024 facelift, but the screen has received a size upgrade and brand-new software, which both make it much easier to interact with. The screen itself now measures a massive 12.9 inches on the diagonal. Underneath it sits a couple of touch-sensitive controls for heater temperature and volume - though with a few combinations of touches it can also perform other functions. The new software is a huge improvement over the old Golf. Functions are much easier to find thanks to a redesigned home screen, while there’s a permanent shortcut bar at the top which can be customised to show the functions you use the most. For us, it’d be the safety menu so we could turn off the speed limit warning straight away. Other means of interacting with the car include the steering wheel, which now features proper physical buttons across the range instead of the awful touch-sensitive ones some pre-facelift Golfs got. Or, if you don’t want to touch anything at all, you can use Volkswagen’s voice assistant. Named IDA, it can control many of the car’s functions and is actually pretty good at understanding what you’re after. Volkswagen’s also built in ChatGPT AI functionality, so if you ask the car a question it doesn’t know the answer to - a good recipe for cookies, for example, or a key date in history to settle an in-car argument - the AI will take over and answer for you. A necessary feature? Time will tell… Of course, there’s also wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto functionality if you’d prefer to bypass VW’s system altogether. A wireless charging pad is also standard. What hasn’t changed is that the Golf’s interior feels extremely high-quality. Little touches, like a luxuriously damped glovebox lid, felt lining to the door bins to stop items rattling or just the satisfying click of the few remaining physical switches leaves you in no doubt that the Golf’s interior is a cut above the Ford Focus or Mazda 3. MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax The Volkswagen Golf is available in GTI , GTD , GTE and R specifications but here we’ll focus on the standard car, which is available with a choice of petrol, diesel and plug-in hybrid petrol models. Most models get a six-speed manual gearbox as standard, with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic available as an option which comes complete with mild-hybrid technology. That technology allows the Golf to coast on the motorway and to activate its engine stop-start while the car is slowing to a stop. The range kicks off with VW’s 115hp, 1.5-litre four-cylinder petrol which returns fuel economy of around 50mpg and produces CO2 emissions of 123g/km. Want an automatic gearbox? Then you can swap the manual for a seven-speed twin-clutch automatic, which comes along with mild hybrid technology and improves fuel economy slightly. Not enough power? Then try 150hp variant, again available as a manual or a mild hybrid automatic. Their mixture of nippy performance and still-excellent fuel economy makes them the pick of the bunch. Do lots of motorway driving? Then consider a 115 or 150hp diesel – both have plenty of mid-range shove, are cheap to tax and can return fuel economy of more than 60mpg. More of a townie that does occasional trips out of the city? Then consider the 204hp plug-in hybrid. It can travel more than 40 miles on battery power alone, meaning there’s the potential to save cash if you have a short commute and somewhere to charge the car. It gets from 0-62mph in 7.2 seconds and officially returns more than 300mpg, but that’ll drop very quickly when the battery is flat. Safety and security Safety and security European safety body Euro NCAP scored the Volkswagen Golf five stars for safety when it was crash tested in 2019. It comes with eight airbags and active cruise control that can brake and accelerate the car automatically. You also get automatic emergency brakes, lane assist, road-sign detection and driver alert which senses when it’s time for you to take a break. All models also come with an alarm, which has an interior sensor. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems The new Volkswagen Golf has suffered from various infotainment gremlins that have been fixed with several updates – make sure any car you buy has been treated to the latest software. Recalls are limited to a fix involving the high-voltage power system in plug-in hybrid models and engine compartment covers that come loose. Both can be fixed free of charge at the dealer. The Golf comes with a three-year/60,000-mile warranty."

If you’ve got a lot of people to transport, then seven-seat SUVs are all well and good - but most of them are cramped in the third row and not really suited to being fully laden with adults. What you really need is an MPV - and the Volkswagen Multivan is the best of the lot. Despite the ‘van’ in its name, not to mention its boxy looks, the Multivan actually shares more of its DNA with the Volkswagen Golf rather than the Transporter panel van. That does mean a pretty hefty price tag, but think of it like buying an American-style fridge-freezer. There are cheaper ways to keep your food cold, but it’s a great way to ensure you have enough space - and it’s more stylish than many alternative solutions. If you find yourself looking at the Volkswagen Multivan you probably have proper van-based MPVs on your shortlist - cars like the Ford Tourneo Custom, the Renault Trafic Passenger or the Mercedes V-Class . Other seven-seaters you might be looking at include the Land Rover Discovery or BMW X7 - or, if you know you’ll only need the third row occasionally, smaller options like the Peugeot 5008 . None of these can hold a candle to the Multivan’s interior, though. As standard, you get seven separate seats that slide and fold with space for an adult in each one. Opt for the long-wheelbase model and they’ll have room to stretch out. On some models you have an even more opulent six-seater layout, while on others you can turn the centre row around for a conference-style setup. Add in a clever sliding central table, cupholders galore, and enough USB ports for everyone to charge their gadgets, and you can see why the Multivan is a parent’s dream for keeping children in the back comfortable and occupied. Life’s good for the driver, too. The Multivan feels like a car up front, with digital instruments, comfortable seats and a big central touchscreen that controls almost everything. It feels like a car to drive, too - admittedly a large and heavy one. The Multivan’s available with a surprisingly perky petrol engine, some efficient diesels and even a plug-in hybrid model which has the potential to really slash your running costs if you can keep the batteries topped up. It’s rather expensive to buy, though not too bad if you’re comparing it to top-end versions of other people-carriers. But you get what you pay for here, and if you’re sensible with the extensive options list the Volkswagen Multivan is an absolutely cracking MPV. Interested?

How much is the Volkswagen Multivan? The Multivan starts from just over £48,000 for a basic diesel model in entry-level Life trim. This does come with most of the basics, though if you’re coming from a car of a similar price you might find the lack of things like heated seats a bit hard to swallow. Style trim commands a £10,000+ premium over the entry level but does have a much greater level of equipment, including nice touches like electric sliding doors. Meanwhile, you can easily add another £10,000 through the options list - but most of the stuff on there is a ‘nice-to-have’ rather than an essential, such as an upgraded sound system or a vast panoramic glass roof. That does sound like a lot, especially if you’re looking at something like a £32,000 SEAT Tarraco SUV . The Multivan’s price is certainly comparable with similar versions of the Ford Tourneo Custom or Mercedes V-Class, though - certainly when you factor in that all versions of the Multivan have lots of equipment and an automatic gearbox. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort Feels big and cumbersome compared to a car, but it’s superbly easy to drive with great visibility In town The Multivan is a big vehicle, especially in the bigger of its two body lengths, and there’s no cheating physics - so you’ll have to make sure parking spaces are large enough and you might breathe in a little going through tight gaps and width restrictions. However, for a vehicle this size it’s very easy to drive. All Multivans are automatic, so your leg gets a rest in heavy traffic, and the steering is light and accurate so threading through traffic or parallel parking is a doddle. Visibility - often a struggle in bigger vehicles - is great too, thanks to thin windscreen pillars with a glazed section reducing your blindspots at the front. You do lose your view out of the back if you have a central passenger, but that’s common to most vehicles like this - and big side mirrors help make up for it. The Multivan’s suspension deals pretty well with speed bumps and pockmarked roads. If you’re travelling with just one or two people, it can feel a little firm and crashy over potholes, but that’s because it’s designed for seven people and their luggage - fully laden it’s much better. If you do primarily town mileage, then the plug-in hybrid engine is by far the best bet. It feels very luxurious travelling on electricity alone, which the Multivan can do for around 20-25 miles depending on your driving style. It’s also very quick off the line for such a big vehicle. On the motorway A little bit of wind noise from the bluff front and the big mirrors doesn’t spoil the Multivan’s very relaxing motorway manners. The lower-powered engines can be a bit raucous getting up to speed but once you’re cruising they settle down nicely and generally the cabin is pretty refined. The diesels are the best engines for those who do a lot of motorway miles, but even the plug-in hybrid is good here. It’s actually the quickest engine of the lot, and the ability to coast down inclines on electric power means it’s more efficient than you’d think over long distances. On a twisty road It’s a little less lumbering than a Mercedes V-Class and about on par with a Ford Tourneo Custom - but the Multivan doesn’t like to be hustled down a country lane. There’s a surprising turn of pace from the top petrol and the plug-in hybrid engine, but mostly the powertrains prefer to be driven in a more relaxed manner. Adjustable suspension is available as an option, but even ‘Sport’ mode doesn’t make much difference as you still feel the Multivan lean a lot through the bends. If you do press on, though, you’ll find the steering surprisingly satisfying for such a big vehicle. Space and practicality Space and practicality A brilliantly flexible space for passengers, but alternatives can carry eight or even nine people Negatives out of the way first - the Multivan is a strict seven-seater, with a 2-2-3 seating layout. Most van-based MPVs, such as the Ford Tourneo Custom, have six seats in the rear, and some even have a double front passenger seat to carry nine passengers total - so the VW loses out a little in terms of overall carrying capacity. For the seven people who can sit here, though, it’s very good indeed. The front seat passengers have a great time of things, with comfortable seats with loads of adjustment. There are armrests on both sides, and a more car-like driving position than you might expect from a vehicle that’s so upright. Storage up front is good too. There’s a big glovebox, multi-level door bins and a couple of smaller covered storage areas higher up the dashboard. Flip down a cubby in the centre and you’ll reveal a pair of cupholders, above which sits a shelf for a smartphone. There’s wireless charging here on the higher Style trim level, but a pair of USB-C ports take care of that on the lower-spec ones so it’s no huge loss. Space in the back seats With all five rear seats able to slide individually, you can easily balance out legroom between passengers and make more room in the boot if needed. Five six-foot adults can get comfortable in the back with ease. If your family is very tall, you might prefer the Long version, which gives just a little extra flexibility - this is also useful for luggage as the regular model has quite a shallow boot when all five seats are pushed back. Accessing the third row is a doddle - the middle seats slide all the way forward and fold out of the way, and the Multivan’s big sliding doors create a sizeable aperture to scramble through. They’re a boon in car parks, too, as they can’t ding the vehicle next to you. They can be a little heavy if you’re parked on a hill, though the electrically operated doors of the Style model make this easier. Rear passengers have full use of a clever sliding centre console, too. At the press of a button it rises up and two airline-style tables fold out, plus it’s littered with cupholders and a big storage drawer. There are also cupholders and USB-C ports along the vehicle’s sides, plus more tables on the front seatbacks. It’s really versatile back here. Boot space The Multivan’s enormous tailgate could be difficult to open if you’ve parked close to a wall. Volkswagen quotes a generous 469 litres of space in the standard wheelbase Multivan and 763 litres for the Long model, but that’s when loaded right up to the roof - it’s not so generous up to the rear window. If you want to load large bags or other big items, you’ll probably want to slide the third row of seats forward by a click or two. A Ford Tourneo Custom or Mercedes V-Class has more luggage space as standard, with the latter quoting a minimum of 610 litres of space. The Multivan’s seats do fold flat but they don’t disappear into the floor like you might expect from a more traditional MPV or seven-seat SUV. If you fold them all down and slide them as far forward as they’ll go, you’ll liberate plenty of room - but for the maximum loading volume you’ll need to take them out entirely. They are pretty light compared to, say, the seats in the old Volkswagen Caravelle - but you will need somewhere to store them once they’re out. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories A high-quality interior, but the infotainment is frustrating to use The Multivan’s interior has a lot that’s easily recognisable from Volkswagen’s passenger car range. The steering wheel and gear selector, for example - or the standard-fit digital dials and infotainment touchscreen. It’s all very high-tech and very nice, giving you the impression that you’re in a luxury people-mover rather than just a glorified van. Style models even have a swathe of wood trim across the dashboard, which just about skirts the line between classy and tacky - you’ll make up your own mind. What’s more important is that everything feels high-quality, even if a few of the materials - such as those lower down on the dash or on the door cards - don’t entirely feel like they justify the high price tag. Most frustrations come with the infotainment system. It’s the same one fitted to Volkswagen’s passenger cars, and it deals with not only sat-nav and media but climate controls and driving functions too. It’s clear and most functions are easy to find, but it’s needlessly complicated to alter the air-conditioning en route or tailor the driving mode to one you want. It’s also quite prone to crashing, which isn’t ideal if you’re relying on it for your route planning. It’s an extra shame because it replaces almost all physical switchgear in the vehicle. There isn’t even a volume knob - instead, you get an awkward touch-sensitive slider that’s impossible to see in the dark. MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax The Multivan is pretty efficient for how big and heavy it is. The fuel economy champion is theoretically the plug-in hybrid, which returns an official figure of more than 150mpg. In the real world, that’ll depend on how often you charge it up. We saw around 24 miles of electric range from a full charge, which could easily be enough for a school run or a commute without using the petrol engine at all. With a discharged battery, you can expect about 30mpg from this engine around town and more than 35mpg on a long motorway run, which is impressive. For the diesels, you can expect to see close to 40mpg if you drive carefully, while the petrol engines provide the lowest fuel economy at around 30mpg at a cruise. These figures are still pretty comparable with what you’d get from a Ford Tourneo Custom or Mercedes V-Class, though. The PHEV Multivan sits in the 14% category for BIK company car tax, which is very reasonable. All Multivans are subject to the additional road tax supplement for cars over £40,000. Safety and security Safety and security The Multivan has a full five-star Euro NCAP safety rating with impressive ratings all round - 90 percent for adult occupants, 89 percent for child occupants and even 87 percent in the tricky Safety Assist category. All models come with autonomous emergency braking, lane keeping assist, adaptive cruise control and more airbags than you can shake a stick at, which is reassuring if you’re going to fill the interior with fragile children. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems Volkswagen’s warranty is just three years and 60,000 miles, though this is matched by the offerings from Ford and Mercedes. In fact, the only manufacturer who offers a long warranty on a big MPV like this is Toyota with the Proace Verso. VW’s reputation for reliability is middle-of-the-pack, with a mediocre performance in the 2023 Driver Power owner satisfaction survey . The Multivan is also much more closely related to the brand’s passenger cars than it is its vans, which suggests the equipment and engines won’t necessarily have that commercial vehicle longevity."

The Volkswagen Polo GTI is a small family car that’s practical, well built and fast enough to keep up with some sports cars on a tight country road. In this respect, it’s a bit more like a retired greyhound than the yappy, terrier-like Ford Fiesta ST . It might spend most of its time sleeping on your slippers in front of the fire, but it’s still happy to show other dogs a clean pair of heels (or paws) playing fetch in the park. Sadly, this tempting combination doesn’t come cheap, but at least the VW Polo GTI’s upmarket interior helps justify its price tag. Its cabin shares most of its trim with the already pretty posh Polo so it feels more special than a Fiesta ST. You get a pair of very supportive sports seats (upholstered in VW’s signature GTI tartan), shiny red inserts and a digital instrument panel is now standard, following a 2021 revision. Thankfully, these sporty additions haven’t made the VW Polo GTI any less easy to live with than the standard Polo – it’s still one of the most spacious and practical small cars around. There’s loads of adjustment to help you get comfy in the front seats and enough room in the back for six-foot-tall adults to sit behind an equally tall driver. The VW Polo GTI’s practicality is streets ahead of the competition. There’s significantly more space in the boot than you get in the Ford Fiesta ST or Mini Cooper S and it feels more comfortable and more grown-up than these cars around town, too. It’s easy to drive and – with the optional adaptive suspension fitted – it soaks up bumps and potholes impressively well for a small hot hatch , which you would usually expect to be quite bouncy. Head out onto an empty country road and the VW Polo GTI’s powerful 2.0-litre turbocharged petrol engine and boisterous exhaust noise certainly help it stand out. That 2021 update gave the Polo GTI more power than before — 207hp — meaning it’ll sprint from 0-62mph in 6.5 seconds and its sporty suspension helps it feel stable at speed and grip keenly in tight corners. It might not be quite as agile as the smaller Ford Fiesta ST but driving the VW Polo GTI is more relaxing for long periods and it’s quieter at motorway speeds – especially now that radar-guided cruise control comes as standard. You even get an automatic DSG gearbox as standard in all VW Polo GTIs, so you can rest easy knowing the car provides hot-hatch thrills in a more mature package than any other alternative.

How much is the Volkswagen Polo GTI? How much is the Volkswagen Polo GTI? You’ll not be especially surprised to learn that the Polo GTI is not cheap. It is, in fact, the most expensive Polo you can buy, and the Polo was already fairly pricey by small car standards. It’s slightly more expensive than the equivalent Ford Fiesta ST, although in compensation it offers a more refined driving experience and, actually, a little more horsepower than the Ford. It’s considerably more expensive than the Suzuki Swift Sport , but then the Polo GTI is not only much quicker than the Swift, it also has an interior that looks and feels like a Rolls-Royce compared to the Swift’s cheap and cheerful cabin. The Polo GTI is even more expensive than the five-door version of the Mini Cooper S, although it’s packing an extra 20hp compared to the Mini, and is better equipped (and roomier) as standard. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort The Polo GTI is not too stiff around town, but there’s slightly too much tyre noise for real long-haul motorway comfort The Polo GTI now gets standard adaptive suspension dampers, which means that you can stiffen them up for driving on a twisty road (see below…) but switch to a more comfortable experience if you’re driving around town. The difference between the two modes isn’t night-and-day, so the Polo GTI still feels fairly firm around town, but it’s not brutal, and nor does it make you feel uncomfortable. It just feels sporty, which is the whole point, really. The standard Polo good and bad stuff applies when you’re in town. Visibility is good, except for the chunky rear pillars taking away some of your over-the-shoulder view. The steering — sportier and slightly heavier here in the GTI — is still light enough to make parking manoeuvres nice and easy, and the Polo’s relatively compact size means it’ll fit into most spaces, although the larger alloy wheels mean that the turning circle goes up a bit compared to the standard Polo . You get VW’s Park Distance Control sensors (but not a reversing camera) as standard on the GTI which makes things slightly easier. As well as the adaptive dampers, the Polo GTI gets sports suspension that’s 15mm lower down than that of the standard car, and when you combine that with bigger 17-inch alloy wheels, and sportier tyres, what you get is a lot of tyre noise at a motorway cruise, much more than you’d find in the standard model. The Polo GTI comes only with a seven-speed automatic DSG dual clutch gearbox these days, which maybe isn’t the best thing from an enthusiast’s point of view (a manual would be nice…) but it does make longer journeys that bit more relaxing. Equally helping to make things more relaxing are standard-fit radar-guided cruise control, which can brake you all the way down to a safe stop in traffic, and lane-keeping steering. There’s also clever auto high-beam LED matrix headlights, which can alter the layout of your high-beam lights at night, meaning you can keep as much light on the road ahead as possible without dazzling other drivers, which again makes long journeys much easier and more relaxing. The Polo GTI is very stable and very predictable when you chuck it at a corner. Does that mean it’s also a little bit dull? Maybe… Certainly, it’s less of an attacker of apexes than the Ford Fiesta ST, and the steering doesn’t have the same sense of involvement and connection as you’ll get in a Mini Cooper S. That said, it has a more natural feel than the ST’s, and there’s less of the darting about that you get with the Ford. Pick your line and the Polo hooks up and takes you round. It’s very reassuring. Point the Polo GTI, and it goes where you want it to, unerringly. That’s great from a confidence point of view, but it’s less good when you remember that you can’t quite flick it at a corner, nor adjust your cornering line, in the same way that you can in a Ford Fiesta ST. You do get VW’s electronic front ‘XDS’ differential, which uses the front brakes to help the Polo GTI sniff out grip and traction, and that’s a big help especially on a wet road. The standard DSG auto gearbox could be a liability here, but actually it’s fast and responsive, especially in Sport mode, and while a manual would be more involving (you can change manually with the paddles or the shifter, but the gearbox’s electronics will still annoyingly take over and change up or down if they really, really feel like it), the DSG kind of suits the Polo GTI’s ‘great all-rounder’ remit. It strikes a good balance between fun and practical. Space and practicality Space and practicality The Polo is, as you’d expect from a VW hatchback, very practical with plenty of space in the back seats. The GTI gets a smaller boot than that of the standard Polo though, which is limiting The Polo GTI — and indeed all Polos — come with a central armrest, which isn’t true of all other small cars, so there’s some handy storage under that. There’s also a large storage area at the base of the dashboard, which will hold a phone and comes with two USB-C connectors too. The glovebox is decent in size, and there’s a little flip-down holder for your sunglasses in the roof. The door bins are good too, and can hold a 1.5-litre bottle of water. There are also a couple of cupholders down on the centre console, next to the handbrake but these are a weird octagon shape, which don’t grip your bottle of water as tightly as they should. A small car the Polo GTI might be, but in the back seats it’s really quite spacious. There’s plenty of headroom and knee-room, so even passengers who are over six-feet tall will be fine. There’s a little bit of space for your feet under the front seats too, so you can stretch out slightly. There are some useful touches in the back of the Polo GTI too, such as ISOFIX points with no annoying covers on the latches so it’s easy to plug in a child safety seat. There’s another set of ISOFIX points in the front passenger seat too, so the Polo GTI is really family-practical. Rear seat passengers also get their own USB-C sockets. That said, the Skoda Fabia — closely related to the Polo don’t forget — is roomier still in the back, although sadly there’s no longer a sporty vRS Fabia to act as a foil for the Polo GTI. One annoying thing — the rear windows don’t wind all the way down. In fact, there’s a good couple of inches of glass left sticking up. Does no-one at VW like to rest their arms on the open windowsill or something? Thanks to the design of the GTI’s rear suspension, the Polo GTI has a smaller boot than that of the standard model. The regular Polo has a roomy 351-litre boot, but for the GTI that drops to 303 litres. That’s still more than you get in a Ford Fiesta ST (292 litres), and way more than you get in a Mini Cooper S (211 litres), but it still feels a bit snug compared to some hot hatches, such as the Hyundai i20 N which gets a 352-litre boot. At least the Polo GTI has only a small load lip over which to lift heavy things, and there are handy storage areas at the side of the boot as well as hooks for shopping bags. The rear seats split-fold easily (you can do it just by leaning into the boot) and they give you a continuous load floor, even though the seat backs don’t sit completely flat. There’s nowhere to stash the rigid luggage cover, which is annoying. Helpfully though there is a dedicated runner for the rear seatbelt, so when you fold the back seats down, they don’t get caught in the belt, and the belt doesn’t get stuck behind the seat when you flip everything back up again. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories The cabin quality is probably the best of any hot hatch although the touch-sensitive controls aren’t as easy to use as regular buttons Here’s where the Polo GTI really scores highly. The cabin is just lovely, with lots of very high quality plastics (aside from some scratchy grey stuff on the tops of the doors). The front seats are just figure-hugging enough without being too tight and you’ve got to love the nicely retro tartan seat trim, a throwback to the original 1976 Golf GTI. The recent updates to the whole Polo range mean you get a new touch-sensitive climate control panel mounted down low, which is easy enough to use even though the controls are similar to the awkward screen-and-sliders layout you get in VW’s electric ID models. Here in the Polo GTI, though, they’re at least backlit so you can use them at night. You get a big screen in the centre of the dash for the infotainment system, which is — again — slightly easier to use than that of the electric cars that VW makes, but which oddly comes with two physical knobs, one for volume and one for tuning, which seems a bit strange. Equally the button for the voice control is located on the dash, on the far side (set up for left-hand drive, clearly) and there’s no button for voice control on the steering wheel. The 10.25-inch digital instrument screen works well though, and it has some GTI-specific colour and display variations. The new-look, slimmer steering wheel has proper physical buttons too, which are easier to use than the touch-sensitive pads used by some other models, which allow you to control the instrument screen nice and easily. Optionally, you can use the forward-facing camera that runs the emergency braking system as a ‘dash-cam’, storing footage to prove that — hopefully — you weren’t at fault if you have an accident. MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax For a car with a 2.0-litre, turbocharged, 207hp engine the Polo GTI is not what you’d call very thirsty. The official WLTP figure sits at 42mpg, and experience with the closely-related engine from the Golf GTI suggests that you can actually beat that if you take things gently. CO2 emissions are a bit chunkier though at 154g/km, which means you’ll pay a pricey first year’s tax, although at least the Polo GTI’s relatively modest price means you’ll not need to worry about the levy for cars costing more than £40,000. Safety & security Safety & security VW has long marketed the Polo as being one of the safest cars around, and when you look at the Euro NCAP crash test results, you can see that’s not just advertising waffle. The Polo scores a maximum five stars on the crash tests, with a 94 per cent adult protection rating — better than some much bigger and more expensive cars. Standard safety equipment for the GTI includes active cruise control, lane-keeping steering , ‘extended’ pedestrian and cyclist detection for the automated emergency braking system, road sign recognition, a speed limiter, and driver fatigue detection. In terms of security, you get an anti-theft alarm system, interior monitoring, backup horn, and towing protection and the parking camera system can optionally be used as a ‘sentry’ system, monitoring the car’s surroundings and pinging an alert to your mobile phone if it detects anything untoward. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems Is the Polo reliable? Generally speaking yes, but while VW as a brand tends to sit at the higher end of reliability survey tables, the Polo itself is often more of a mid-table performer. Keep an eye out for niggles with the infotainment system, especially. All VW models come with a three year warranty in the UK, which has unlimited mileage for the first two years, but which is limited to 60,000 miles in year three. You can extend that warranty out to five years from £140 per year, depending on the model. The Polo has had some recalls, including ones for a loose rear spoiler, a faulty passenger airbag, a wonky sunroof, faulty rear seatbelt buckles, and oil getting into the brake booster."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/volkswagen/t-roc,Volkswagen T-Roc Review & Prices,"€41,020",7/10,new,"Is the Volkswagen T-Roc a good car? Is the Volkswagen T-Roc a good car? The Volkswagen T-Roc is a bit like a Stanley cup - it’s slightly posh, pretty expensive and incredibly popular. Volkswagen sells almost as many T-Rocs as it does Golfs, so chances are if you’re looking for a small SUV , you’ve got a T-Roc shortlisted. Luckily this Volkswagen does have quite a lot to recommend it. It’s practical, pretty good to drive, and has the enduring appeal of the Volkswagen badge. The T-Roc sits between the T-Cross and the Tiguan in Volkswagen’s range of SUVs. It’s more stylish than the boxy T-Cross, and as well as the standard SUV can be had as the hot T-Roc R or the interesting T-Roc Convertible , both of which we’ve reviewed separately. It was launched in 2017 and underwent a pretty hefty facelift in 2022. If you’re in the market for a small SUV, the T-Roc is just one of many cars you might be considering - and impressive alternatives include cars like the Peugeot 2008 , Skoda Kamiq , and Ford Puma . The T-Roc may not be particularly glitzy on the outside, but it’s stylish in a solid, classy way - and that continues on the inside, with an interior that’s more function over form but still operates well and feels quite good to sit in. Space is decent; though the back seats are only average, you do get a very big boot. Big rear doors make it excellent for child seats, too, and the T-Roc did score five stars in Euro NCAP’s crash-testing which is reassuring if it’s going to be used as a family car. It’s pretty well-equipped as standard, too. Even entry-level cars get an 8.0-inch touchscreen that’s easy to use with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto as standard, plus a digital driver’s display, climate control, all-round parking sensors and some smart storage solutions. You do, however, pay handsomely if you want to move up the model range. The basic Life trim isn’t too expensive, but if you want the posher R-Line car with a more powerful engine the price jumps up quite a lot. With a few optional extras you can easily push the price over £40,000 - you can get a really nice BMW X1 M Sport for that sort of money. The T-Roc does drive quite well for a small SUV, though. None of the engines have any hybrid or electric trickery, but that keeps the overall weight low - and that means it corners nicely and feels light on its feet around town. The engine range is good too, and there is even a diesel option and four-wheel drive available - both increasingly rare among compact SUVs. At the entry level, there’s a 1.0-litre petrol with just 115hp which feels a bit sluggish. The 1.5-litre petrol with 150hp is probably the best all-rounder, with manual or automatic gearboxes available - while the 200hp 2.0-litre petrol is somewhat overkill. The diesels are great for very long-distance drivers, with miserly fuel consumption, but you won’t get the best from them around town. If you like what you hear you can see how much you could save with Carwow’s Volkswagen T-Roc deals . You could also get a great deal by browsing used T-Roc models , as well as extensive stock of other used Volkswagens from our network of trusted dealers. When it’s time to sell your car , Carwow can help with that, too. How much is the Volkswagen T-Roc? How much is the Volkswagen T-Roc? The T-Roc range kicks off at just over £28,000 for the ‘Life’ model, which does come well-equipped with a digital dashboard, 8.0-inch infotainment screen, LED headlights and all-round parking sensors. We’d recommend stepping up to at least Match trim, which brings bigger alloys, a rear-view camera and keyless entry for just a few hundred pounds more. Style and R-Line add extra luxury and sportiness, respectively through visual appeal and equipment, though the R-Line does get sports suspension. At the top of the range there’s the T-Roc R, which we’ve reviewed separately. The T-Roc does seem quite expensive compared with cars of a similar size, such as the Peugeot 2008 or Skoda Kamiq - which both start at several thousand pounds less. Add on some desirable extras, such as an automatic gearbox or additional equipment, and the price soon jumps significantly. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort The T-Roc is composed and can even be quite fun, though it’s not the most comfortable over bumps With good visibility and light steering the T-Roc is pretty easy to drive around town. While the suspension can feel a little firm over some bigger bumps - it’s not as cushioned as a Peugeot 2008, for example - it’s not unbearable by any means. Though automatic gearboxes are usually easier for town driving, in the T-Roc we’d avoid the seven-speed DSG that’s available on certain engine variants. While it’s perfectly good most of the time, it can be annoyingly hesitant right when you need a quick response - such as if you’re trying to nip out into traffic at a junction or roundabout. And unlike most of the alternatives you might consider, the T-Roc isn’t available with any hybrid, plug-in hybrid or electric engine options. Instead, you get just plain petrol and diesel - which aren’t the most efficient in heavy traffic. The hybrid powertrain of a Toyota C-HR suits urban driving much better. The T-Roc feels composed at a cruise, and isn’t bothered by crosswinds - it’s quite relaxing, especially considering adaptive cruise control is fitted as standard to help you maintain your distance to the car in front. Wind and road noise are well contained, though some of the engines - particularly the diesels - can be a little noisy, especially if you drop down a gear for an overtake. The firm suspension never really settles down either, leading you to feel expansion joints and poor surfaces more than you would in a vehicle with softer suspension. Out on twistier roads, the T-Roc holds its own really well. It’s not the most invigorating car to drive, but you can certainly have fun with it. You get a good sense of the road surface and grip beneath you as well - moreso than in a Peugeot 2008. The T-Roc is notably lightweight compared with some alternatives - that’s the benefit of not fitting a hybrid powertrain - which means it feels nimble and changes direction with more urgency than something like a Toyota C-HR. Optional Dynamic Chassis Control (DCC) brings adjustable suspension, which helps numb the otherwise quite firm ride - it allows you to set the car’s suspension to its softest setting for a more comfortable trip, but to keep the engine and gearbox in their sportier settings for a more involving drive. The T-Roc is rare in that four-wheel drive is available on certain models - very few small SUVs offer this. While this doesn’t exactly turn it into a miniature Land Rover, it might be useful if you live rurally and frequently need extra grip. Space and practicality Space and practicality Average rear seat space, but good storage and a huge boot Volkswagen has done a good job of making the cabin of the T-Roc practical. There are large door bins, two central cupholders – albeit quite awkwardly-shaped ones – and a good space in the centre console to hold your phone when it’s connected to the infotainment system. The glove box is a decent size too, while the central armrest lifts up to reveal a small cubby. You can adjust the armrest by sliding it forwards and backwards, making it easy to get comfortable. You even get a useful drawer under the driver’s seat. There’s loads of adjustment in the driver’s seat and notably in the steering wheel, which telescopes out a really long way - great if you’re tall. Electrically-adjustable seats aren’t even available as an optional extra, though, and having to adjust your own seat on a car that can cost well over £40,000 feels a bit mean. The T-Roc is by no means small, but it’s a bit tighter in the back seats compared to the Peugeot 2008 or Skoda Kamiq. Taller people in particular will find the rear seats to be a squeeze, with the legroom being rather limited. You’ll find your knees digging into the back of the front seats, while there isn’t the most foot room either. Headroom is quite good, even for adults. The middle seat though is not really an option for anything more than a short journey, as you’ll take up precious space from the feet of other passengers, and it’s not wide enough to hold three adults for too long. Storage is pretty good though, as you get a decent door bin, seat pockets for any devices or books, and a large folding armrest in the middle. It’s nice and easy to fit child seats, too, with wide-opening rear doors and just about enough space for a bulky rear-facing unit. The T-Roc’s boot is one of the largest among small SUVs. With 445 litres of space, it’s bigger than the 400-litre Skoda Kamiq or the 434-litre Peugeot 2008, and dwarfs the 377-litre Toyota C-HR. It’s a nice square shape, too, and all models get an adjustable boot floor which can be lowered for maximum volume or raised up to make a totally flat loading sill with no lip between the boot and the folded seatbacks. The seats fold in a 60:40 split, and you also get a ski hatch to facilitate through-loading of long, narrow items. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories The T-Roc hasn’t got the most exciting cabin around, but it’s simply styled and well-equipped The T-Roc isn’t and never will be a style icon, but it’s all simply laid out and has clear lines across the dash. The majority of T-Rocs will come with dark grey and black trim for the cloth upholstery and dashboard. The materials used high-up are of good quality, but lower down and in the back, scratchier plastics are easy to find and detract from the overall feel of the cabin quite a bit. There’s some ambient lighting that’s fitted as standard, which adds a little more character. It's a shame that, since the facelift in 2022, Volkswagen no longer offers the T-Roc with colourful inserts in the dashboard - these really brightened the interior up. What you will have to contend with is a reduced amount of buttons in the central console. Yes, it looks simpler and easier to navigate, but the air conditioning controls are now consolidated to a touch-sensitive slider that’s tricky to use on the move. With Apple CarPlay and Android Auto fitted as standard, you’ll likely to use that rather than the standard-fit infotainment system. That being said, it’s not a bad system — running smoothly and is easy enough to navigate on the go. As standard, you also get a digital driver’s display rather than conventional dials. There are multiple configurable displays too, so you’ll be able to find the setup and screen you’re happy with. MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax With a wide range of engines, T-Roc running costs extend from reasonable to somewhat less reasonable. Unlike many of its competitors, there are no hybrid or electric variants available, which does limit its appeal slightly. The basic 1.0-litre engine is pretty efficient round town, and on a gentle run should be able to top 50mpg. The 1.5-litre petrol averages around 40mpg with a manual gearbox. The automatic makes it slightly less efficient around town, but does improve cruising economy because it allows for fewer revs in top gear. You’re likely to see around 35mpg from the 2.0-litre petrol. The fuel-sipper in the range is the 2.0-litre diesel, which should be able to average over 50mpg and approaching 60mpg on a long run. However, it’s not great if you do lots of short trips as it’ll never really get a chance to warm up, and it’s also more expensive to buy. Road tax costs are reasonable, as are benefit-in-kind company car tax costs, but the T-Roc will never compete with hybrid or PHEV alternatives on this score, let alone electric models, as its emissions are simply far too high in comparison. Safety and security Safety and security The refreshed T-Roc hasn’t been retested by Euro NCAP , but when it was put through its paces in 2017 it scored five stars. That included high scores for both occupant categories (96% for adults, 87% for children) and decent returns on assists and pedestrian safety. That being said, Euro NCAP testing has become more intense since then. As standard, the T-Roc comes with automatic emergency braking, lane keep assist , front and rear parking sensors, driver alert system and cruise control. If you have an automatic, you get adaptive cruise control with distance control, which makes driving longer distances much easier. You also get curtain airbags for the front and rear, ISOFIX points and e-Call for Europe to make sure you and your passengers are safe. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems A limited number of the pre-facelift T-Roc had issues with bonnets coming loose and a faulty seatbelt retractor, but besides those, the T-Roc manages to be quite a reliable car. Not the most reliable, but certainly unlikely to let you down. Volkswagen doesn’t offer the best warranty package around, but the first two years have an unlimited mileage warranty which is helpful. The third year of warranty can be finished early if you reach 60,000 miles from new. VW does offer extended warranty packages from £140 per year. Volkswagen T-Roc FAQs Volkswagen T-Roc FAQs"
https://www.carwow.co.uk/volkswagen/idbuzz,Volkswagen ID. Buzz Review & Prices,"€74,936",9/10,new,"Is the Volkswagen ID Buzz a good car? Is the Volkswagen ID Buzz a good car? The Volkswagen ID Buzz is one of the most recognisable electric cars on sale - and despite being a combination of a van and an MPV , neither of which are particularly au fait bodystyles with car buyers, it’s also one of the most desirable. With styling inspired by the classic Volkswagen Microbus, the ID Buzz is proof that a chic and appealing electric car doesn’t have to be an SUV . It’s a bit like upcycling an old piece of furniture - taking an old concept and bringing it into the modern age, but retaining the style and character that made it popular in the first place. As a large, premium electric car, the ID Buzz is a great - and family-friendly - alternative to SUVs such as the Tesla Model Y , Skoda Enyaq , Kia EV9 or Peugeot E-5008 . It’s also a compelling fully-electric alternative to the fantastic Volkswagen Multivan . The design is the primary reason for wanting an ID Buzz. It looks fantastic - it may be slab-sided and boxy, but the devil's in the detail. Glam alloy wheels, rounded edges, and a distinct styling line running around the middle which also serves to divide the great-looking (optional) two-tone paint finishes. There are three distinct versions of the ID Buzz available, with five, six, or seven seats. The latter also gets a longer wheelbase and body, making it an alternative to proper electric people-carriers such as the Ford E-Tourneo Custom - but the shorter models are more nicely proportioned, and still offer a practical, square interior with a huge boot and sliding doors for easy access. Speaking of the interior, it’s a little less eye-catching than the exterior - it uses the same components as Volkswagen’s other ID electric cars, which means a big touchscreen infotainment system and precious little in the way of physical switchgear. There are some nice nods to its van heritage, though, such as a useful sliding centre console and a multi-level boot floor. Space for passengers is excellent, though the ID Buzz isn’t really a true MPV - the seats don’t fold or disappear quite as readily as they do in something like the smaller Volkswagen Touran . It’s a very spec-dependent interior, too. On mid-range Style models, where you can get a light-coloured dashboard and fantastic colour-matched upholstery, it feels really airy and cheerful. On the range-topping GTX, despite the cavernous space on offer, the all-black finish makes it feel positively pokey. There are three trim levels available for the ID Buzz and two choices of electric motor - the regular version or the higher-powered GTX. Even this supposed ‘sporty’ model isn’t much fun to drive, though - the big, heavy Buzz is at its best when it’s driven more gently. Do so, and you’ll find that it’s quite relaxing and comfortable, though those massive wheels can crash into potholes and over speed bumps. The best version of the Buzz has a range of 292 miles, which is pretty good albeit not quite up to the best electric SUVs . But this really isn’t a car that you buy entirely with your head. So if your heart has decided the ID Buzz is the car for you, check out our best Volkswagen ID Buzz deals , or get a great Volkswagen ID Buzz lease deal. You can see used ID Buzz models for sale, or find other used Volkswagens for sale. And remember that Carwow can even help you to sell your old car , when the time comes to move on. How much is the VW ID Buzz? How much is the VW ID Buzz? The ID Buzz range starts at just under £60,000. You don’t have to pay very much extra for the different seating arrangements - the long-wheelbase, seven-seater version is just £510 more expensive than the short-wheelbase, five-seater model. You’ll pay around £4,000 extra for the more highly equipped Style version, and another £4,000 or so on top of that if you’d like the high-powered GTX model. Those prices put it about in the middle of the pricier, but posher Kia EV9, and the more budget-leaning Peugeot E-5008. Strap in, though, because the options list for the ID Buzz is expensive - and pricey. If you want the fantastic two-tone paint, it’ll cost you nearly £3,000. A heat pump (which really should be standard on a car this expensive) is a further £1,000, and if you want heated seats you need to add on an extra £2,000 seating package. It means that the ideal ID Buzz really does come in at more than £70,000. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort The electric setup makes for peaceful and comfortable progression, but the rear-mounted motor isn’t the punchiest around There’s no hiding the fact the Buzz is a large car. Measuring almost five metres long and two metres wide, it’s almost as large as a Range Rover . But at no time does it feel like that, as the rear-wheel drive setup means the front wheels only need to turn. That means a turning circle of just 11.1m. With larger windows all around, you have excellent visibility with the well-sized wing mirrors helping further. You can get cameras with it to help further when manoeuvring in and out of parking spaces or tight streets. Being sat high up also helps massively. As it’s based on the same platform as the Volkswagen ID3 and ID4 , the Buzz feels comfortable enough over bumps and cracks at slower speeds. The noise of the bumps will work around the cabin a little, but it’s not enough to ruin the experience. And while you get a ‘B’ mode to engage higher levels of brake regeneration while you’re driving, unfortunately it’s never fully one pedal driving, meaning you’ll need to apply the brake to come to a stop. EVs can transfer a lot of noise from the outside when driving at higher speeds sometimes, but the Buzz manages to remain quiet apart from some flutter around the wing mirrors. The suspension and well-cushioned seats also mean it remains comfortable over longer journeys, with plenty of space for passengers to stretch out. But as is the main flaw with electric cars on long journeys, the efficiency of the Buzz does suffer at higher speeds, meaning forward planning on trips further afield is definitely required, especially as the range isn’t up with the best EVs to start with. Also getting up to speed can be a little sluggish. The rear-mounted motor does offer enough punch in town to get you going, but on a motorway it doesn’t get you up to speed with the same vigour. You can get it with adaptive cruise control with distance control to take any strain out of long drives, while lane keep assist and brake assist are also included for further assistance. With it being more of a van than anything else, don’t expect the sportiest driving experience. It does have a sport mode, but it doesn’t change the character of Buzz much. It’s got slightly sharper responsiveness and heavier steering, but it’s not that sporty really. Having batteries mounted under the floor, body lean is limited much more than you might think for a van, as the weight is mounted lower, reducing the centre of gravity. There’s also enough direction from the steering and it grips the road well, so making quicker progress isn’t too difficult. Space and practicality Space and practicality Not as flexible as a proper MPV, but plenty of room to spare and a choice of three seating layouts The front of the ID Buzz is very roomy indeed. There’s a totally flat floor and no fixed centre console, so you can easily step in from either side of the vehicle and slide across to your seat - that’s fantastic if you’re parked in a really tight spot, for example. Storage solutions are ample. There are multi-level door bins, and slots on the dashboard to store smaller items, plus a hidden wireless charger that keeps your phone at hand but out of sight and temptation. Two cupholders fold down from the centre, while the sliding centre console has adaptable storage for more drinks or other small items. The seats have tons of adjustment - exceptionally tall drivers will love the ID Buzz, as the driver’s seat goes so far back that even our 6’3 road tester couldn’t reach the pedals. It can feel a little disconcerting looking out, though - the windscreen is so far ahead that it feels a bit like you’re seeing through a tunnel. There are three distinct layouts for the rear seats, each with their pros and cons. The five-seater version comes on the short-wheelbase Buzz, and gives you the biggest boot space behind it. The seats have loads of room, but they’re not particularly flexible - it’s just a regular bench seat like you get in a Golf . You don’t even get a fold-down centre armrest, though there are fold-out tables on the front seatbacks plus USB-C charging ports in the door pockets. You can also get a six-seater layout on the short-wheelbase model. This has two captain’s chairs in the middle row, which are much more comfortable, and a further two seats in the rear. The third row is a little snug, but adults can still fit back there, and access is easy through the big sliding doors. For maximum passenger space, you’ll want the long-wheelbase seven-seat model, with the same three-seat centre bench as the five-seater plus two extra rear seats. Do note, though, that if you’re parked up and charging, you can only get in one side - the charge port actually blocks the door on that side of the vehicle from opening, which is superbly annoying. You get a mammoth boot space in the ID Buzz no matter which version you go for. There’s a board that divides the load area, with drawer-style storage units underneath, ideal for charging cables, first aid kits or other items that you don’t use frequently. You can then use the surface on top of the board as a normal boot. Fold the seats down and you get almost moving-van levels of practicality, but it’s still not quite as useful as something like a Ford Tourneo Custom with the seats removed, or even Volkswagen’s own Multivan. The seats can also be a bit awkward to fold down or move around - you get a slicker experience with a seven-seater SUV like the Peugeot E-5008. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories The cute styling from the exterior continues to the cabin and is combined with lots of space, but the Volkswagen infotainment system issues from other models remain Being one of the ID family, the styling of the Buzz’s cabin is very similar to Volkswagen’s ID3, 4 and 5. But by being a taller car, the Buzz has much more sense of space. With the large windows and high seating position paired to the optional two-tone interior to match the exterior colour, there’s a lot of light coming in – making for a great place to be. Although the standard cabin is an all-black finish, which works better with the Cargo van version, the two-tone interior comes with a wood effect finish across the dash to add extra character. Ambient lighting also helps add further character. As it’s a van though, there’s a lot of straight lines and open space as you head into the back, and the wide windows – that you can’t open – help give even more light in. Where all ID cars fall down, and the Buzz is certainly no exception, is the infotainment system. Since Volkswagen has introduced its latest technology, the reputation of the vehicles have taken a hit, and the laggy system is a serious down point here. It’s easier to connect your phone and use the Android Auto or Apple CarPlay you get as standard. Also as standard you get a 10.0-inch display, but you can optionally select a larger 12.0-inch version if you want a bit more digital real estate on the dashboard. Many of you will be wanting to know if you can turn this into a campervan, and with the help of the optional load floor in the boot, you theoretically can make it into a flat sleeping area. But there isn’t a full-on camper model as yet. Electric range, charging and tax Electric range, charging and tax With the ID Buzz, you get a 77kWh battery pack paired to the rear axle-mounted electric motor. That means a range of 258 miles on a single charge, although in our experience, the real-world range gives closer to 215 miles. To make stops at fast chargers easier, the Buzz will charge at up to 170kW on direct current, meaning it can go from 10-80% charge in just 30 minutes. Being all electric, you don’t have to worry about emissions and additional road tax for now. From 2025 though, you will be needing to pay tax when driving an electric vehicle, so that’s something to bear in mind going forward with electric car ownership. Safety and security Safety and security You want your family car to be secure, and the ID. Buzz is one of the safest cars you can buy. On Euro NCAP tests , the Buzz scored five stars thanks to impressive results in adult occupant and safety assists. The child occupant rating was also excellent, furthering the Buzz’s family safety credentials. The safety assist systems as standard include adaptive cruise control, autonomous emergency braking, lane assist and road sign display, while you can also get dynamic light assist with matrix LED headlights. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems With the car only having arrived on roads in late 2022, it’s difficult to judge whether it’ll be reliable or not. In terms of warranty, you get three years/100,000 miles from new – with the battery warranty being eight years/100,000 miles. You can also get roadside assistance and servicing through Volkswagen, meaning you can keep all your bills in-house with it if you wish. Volkswagen ID. Buzz FAQs Volkswagen ID. Buzz FAQs"
https://www.carwow.co.uk/volkswagen/polo,Volkswagen Polo Review & Prices,"€28,922",8/10,new,"Is the Volkswagen Polo a good car? Is the Volkswagen Polo a good car? Much like a designer sofa, the Volkswagen Polo takes an everyday item and puts a posh spin on it. It’s comfortable and has a bit more pedigree than its alternatives; while other small hatchbacks are more fun to drive, the Polo is the one you’d rather be seen in. Not that it’s the best of the bunch, because there are plenty of great hatchbacks on sale such as the Renault Clio and Peugeot 208 , or electric and hybrid alternatives such as the Renault 5 and Toyota Yaris . It’s a smart looking thing, if not particularly exciting. There are loads of sharp lines around the small hatchback, with funky creases running down the Polo’s flanks, and intricately detailed LED lights on the front and back. It’s definitely more stately than sporty, and there’s more than a whiff of ‘honey I shrunk the Volkswagen Golf ’ about it. Though when you sit inside, it feels anything but small. It’s more spacious than a lot of cars this size, with a wide dashboard and a glossy trim that wraps around onto the door cards. Material quality is high, with loads of soft-touch plastics and only a few scratchier surfaces lower down in the cabin. Unfortunately it is a little dour inside, as the only colours you can choose from are black and dark grey. Boo. The Polo is easy to get comfortable in thanks to its highly adjustable front seats and steering wheel. There’s plenty of space in the back with enough headroom and legroom for rear passengers to remain comfortable on long drives - no mean feat in a small hatchback . You get a good amount of standard kit in the Volkswagen Polo, such as a swish digital driver display and an Apple CarPlay / Android Auto -enabled touchscreen infotainment screen in the dashboard. The lack of physical shortcut buttons means it can be a pain to use on the move though, and its glossy screen is a magnet for finger prints. There are no diesel options available for the Polo, just a 1.0-litre three-cylinder petrol engine with a few different power outputs. The entry level 80hp model is fine for pottering around town, but you’ll want the 95hp or 115hp version if you regularly travel on the motorway or on country lanes. Regardless of which engine you chose, the Polo is a comfortable car in town. It does a great job of absorbing lumps and bumps in the road, but its soft suspension means it doesn’t feel particularly agile on a country lane. Motorways are a breeze too, but it’s a shame you can only have a manual model with a five-speed gearbox as you do get a bit more engine noise and a bit less efficiency than you would with an extra gear. If B-road bashing is important to you then the Volkswagen Polo GTI (which we’ve reviewed separately) might be the best choice, with a much more powerful 2.0-litre turbocharged engine and stiffer, sportier suspension. Have a look at Volkswagen Polo deals on Carwow, or Polo lease deals for an alternative way to get behind the wheel of this posh little hatchback. You can also check out used Volkswagen Polos from our trusted dealer network, as well as other used Volkswagens if you’re open to a bigger car. When it’s time to change, Carwow can even help you sell your current car . How much is the Volkswagen Polo? How much is the Volkswagen Polo? The Volkswagen Polo is slightly more expensive than its Seat Ibiza and Skoda Fabia relatives and a chunk cheaper than a Renault Clio. That being said, with its soft touch plastics and leather trims, it definitely feels more premium than the Ibiza and Fabia. Although you get some great features as standard, you can only get the Ascot Grey paint, so you’ll have to pay more for other colours. Unless you go for the GTI, the Polo comes with a three-cylinder 1.0-litre petrol, so it's economical on fuel, and reasonable to insure and tax. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort The Volkswagen Polo is a breeze to drive around town and reasonably quiet on the motorway but you couldn’t call it exciting and its entry-level petrol engine is weedy The Volkswagen Polo is easy to drive around town thanks to its light steering and good visibility. The relatively slim pillars don’t block your view out at junctions and its large rear windscreen helps make parking a doddle, too. There aren’t many small cars out there that are comfier on the road than the Polo. It won’t jostle you over lumps and bumps like some of its alternatives will. Even in models with larger alloy wheels you won’t be shaken too much by monster potholes and it doesn’t lean excessively in tight corners either. The seven-speed automatic gearbox can be a little jerky at lower speeds so isn’t ideal for parking. Speaking of which, there are plenty of driver assistance options, including parking assist. So even if you’re prone to parallel parking anxiety, you’ll soon find it a breeze. At motorway speeds, the Polo does a good job of muting both wind and tyre noise and it feels impressively stable for a small car. The mid and top-range engines have good punch so are good for overtaking on the motorway, although you’ll struggle with the entry level non-turbo petrol. The five-speed manual gearbox is rather frustrating on the motorway as it could definitely do with an extra gear. Unfortunately a six-speed manual isn’t available, but a seven-speed automatic gearbox is. All models include cruise control though, and you can even upgrade to adaptive cruise control for easier motorway miles. It may not be as fun to drive as a Toyota Yaris, but the Polo’s stable nature does mean you’ll feel confident on twisty roads. Sports suspension is available as an option, but it’s rather unnecessary and you might as well go for the Polo GTI. The standard Polo definitely doesn’t feel sporty. However, there is a fair amount of feedback through the wheel, and the brake pedal is not too sensitive. You can only choose a petrol engine for your Volkswagen Polo. There’s a choice of 1.0-litre three-cylinder motors, of which our pick is the higher-powered, turbocharged 95hp unit. The manual gearbox is precise and feels solid, it’s just a shame you can only choose a five-speed unit. Overall though, the Polo definitely feels competent and easy to drive. Space and practicality Space and practicality It might look small on the outside, but the Volkswagen Polo is impressively roomy on the inside. The boot’s very spacious too, but you’ll still have to remove a bike’s front wheel before it’ll fit The latest Volkswagen Polo is much more spacious inside than the old model. It’s so spacious in fact that it runs the larger Volkswagen Golf very close in terms of outright roominess. There’s loads of space in the front and plenty of adjustment to help you get comfy, even if you’re tall. All the controls are within easy reach and it’s dead easy to tweak the steering wheel position to give you a good view of the digital instrument display. Things are just as roomy in the back seats. You’ll find a pair of cupholders in between the front seats and some well sized door bins, but not much hidden space for odds and sods bar the glovebox. There’s almost as much leg and headroom as in a Golf and far more space than you’ll find in a Vauxhall Corsa or MG 3 . Your taller passengers will have no trouble getting comfy and there’s enough space under the seats in front for them to tuck their feet under, too. The Volkswagen Polo is one of the best small family cars for carrying three abreast. It’s still a little cosy with three adults on board but the central seat’s reasonably wide and there’s only a small lump in the floor to get in the way of your middle passenger’s feet and it’s a breeze to fit a child seat using the standard ISOFIX anchor points. These anchors are clearly marked but you’ll have to be careful not to lose their removable plastic covers. Luggage space is very competitive too. At 351 litres, the Polo’s boot is larger than the one you’ll get in a Toyota Yaris (286 litres), an MG 3 (up to 291 litres) and a Peugeot 208 (311 litres). The Skoda Fabia and Renault Clio have more luggage capacity at 380 and 390 litres respectively, though. The Polo has a slight boot lip which can get in the way when you’re loading heavy items but its square shape makes it easy to pack full of large boxes. With the rear seats up there’s enough room to carry a baby buggy or two suitcases and there’s a selection of handy tether points and hooks to keep smaller items secure. All models get a two-way (60:40) split seat, so you can carry as many as two passengers and some long luggage in the boot at once. With the rear seats folded, the Volkswagen Polo has an almost flat load bay – there’s no annoying step in the floor like in a Vauxhall Corsa. This makes it easy to slide heavy boxes right up behind the front seats. There’s enough space to carry a bike too, but you’ll have to remove one of its wheels first. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories The Volkswagen Polo has a smart, upmarket cabin and feels impressively well built for such a small car. It is a little bland though The Volkswagen Polo interior feels more grown-up than in a lot of small hatchbacks. Almost every surface you’ll regularly touch (and plenty you won’t) comes with a soft squidgy finish and all the controls feel just as solid as the larger (and more expensive) Golf. Every Volkswagen Polo comes with a touchscreen infotainment display - even the entry-level Life model gets a 6.5-inch unit - nestled neatly in a glossy black bezel on the dashboard. They’re bright and easy to read but don't have any physical shortcut buttons so it’s a little tricky to switch between key features on the move. They all use a slightly older operating system than what you get in the latest Volkswagens, but it’s still sharp, responsive and easy to use. In fact, we think it’s a bit more intuitive than the newer system you’ll find in the Golf. All models get a digital driver’s display with a high-resolution screen behind the steering wheel – just like in the Golf. It can display a range of info, from your mpg to a huge sat-nav map. Lower-rung models get an 8.0-inch screen but you can also get a 10.0-inch screen on higher trim levels, which looks very nearly as good as the Virtual Cockpit available in expensive Audis . As far as gadgets are concerned, the Volkswagen Polo has your bases covered. It’s much more user friendly than the system in a Renault Clio, but it would benefit from a set of physical buttons rather than the fiddly touch sensitive ones to help you skip between key features without taking your eyes off the road. The entry-level Life model at least gets physical dials for the climate control. Its menus are sensibly laid out but its glossy screen shows up every last greasy finger mark. Similarly, the glossy plastic bezel around the screen looks nice but scratches easily – not ideal for something you’ll poke and prod regularly. You get satellite navigation in posher trims, but it’s a £620 option on the lower-spec cars; it has easy-to-follow directions and crisp, clear maps. If you’re not a fan, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay smartphone mirroring features are standard across the range. These let you use a variety of your phone’s apps (including navigation and music streaming) through the car’s built-in display. MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax The mid-range 95hp version of the 1.0-litre engine is more efficient than the entry level 80hp engine so it’s worth spending the extra money, but if you mainly drive around town the 80hp option will get you around just fine - if very slowly. The seven-speed DSG automatic gearbox is slightly less economical than the manual – again it's a bit of shame that a six-speed manual isn’t available as this would be even more efficient on the motorway. The Renault Clio offers a six-speed manual with a 1.0-litre petrol engine, and is more economical to run. CO2 figures between 117-129g/km mean company car users will pay between 29-31% benefit in kind (BIK) tax on the Polo depending on the engine, so you might want to look at a hybrid or electric alternative instead. Safety & security Safety & security The Polo is one of the safest cars you can buy and gets a full five-star Euro NCAP rating. It offers great protection in the front seats, but like most cars, is slightly worse in the back. As standard you get a suite of airbags and three ISOFIX child seat mounting points (two in the back and one in the front seat) which is great for added peace of mind when carrying tiny passengers. The Polo also comes with standard-fit lane keep assist and a front crash monitoring system, which contributes to its five-star safety rating. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems Typically, the Volkswagen Polo is a reliable car, however there have been some recalls in the past because of faulty seat belt fittings, handbrake levers and towing kits. As much as the Polo feels well built and sturdy, Volkswagen came a lowly 29th out of 32 manufacturers for reliability in the 2024 Driver Power survey. Volkswagen offers a three-year warranty or up to 60,000 miles, whichever comes first. If you think you’ll go over the mileage, you can always buy an extended warranty for peace of mind. Whilst the Polo is a great car, its warranty can be a little discouraging compared to some alternatives. The Hyundai i20 for example covers up to 100,000 miles or five years, while the Toyota Yaris has a warranty that can be extended up to 10 years or 100,000 miles with yearly main dealer servicing.

https://www.carwow.co.uk/volkswagen/t-cross,Volkswagen T-Cross Review & Prices,"€34,574",8/10,new,"Is the Volkswagen T-Cross a good car? Is the Volkswagen T-Cross a good car? The Volkswagen T-Cross is a small SUV that’s among the best in its class. If you’re a couple or a small family and you have your heart set on an SUV, then the T-Cross is a car you should be shortlisting - it drives like a hatchback, has the practicality of a mini-MPV, feels better inside than many premium models yet it’s one of the cheapest cars Volkswagen sells. The T-Cross definitely punches above its weight, then. It’s a bit like a roast chicken dinner - not flashy, not complicated, but still excellent and hits the spot most of the time. The T-Cross is based on the same underpinnings as the VW Polo hatchback, and isn’t much bigger in terms of its footprint. That means it has tons of similarly-sized SUV alternatives - from the mechanically-related SEAT Arona , to the sporty Ford Puma and the plush Peugeot 2008 . Climb inside, and you’ll find the T-Cross has loads of room courtesy of its nice squared-off body. It’s one of the roomiest cars for its size, with space for six-footers to stretch out in the back especially with the neat sliding rear seat which allows you to balance legroom and luggage space. Front passengers are well treated too, and the T-Cross’ raised ride height lets you tower over most family hatchbacks for a great view out. An update in 2024 improved the interior finish of the T-Cross. While older cars felt decidedly cheap and plasticky, the newer model has much nicer materials, particularly across the face of the dashboard and on the door cards where your arm rests. It also improved the technology, tidied up the trim levels, and crowd-sourced the name for the bright yellow paint (Rubber Ducky Yellow - brilliant). It also removed the very sensible physical climate controls for an awkward touch-sensitive panel, though, so it’s not all positive change. In contrast to lots of other small SUVs, you won’t find a hybrid option or a fully-electric version of the Volkswagen T-Cross. Three engines are available - a 1.0-litre petrol with 95hp or 110hp, or a more powerful 1.5-litre with 150hp. Of these, we reckon it’s the middle engine that’s by far the best - it’s powerful enough, very efficient and can be had with manual or automatic gearboxes. Regardless of engine, the T-Cross is a competent car to drive. It’s not fun like a Ford Puma, and a Citroen C3 Aircross irons out the bumps more effectively, but the little VW feels solid, reassuring and stable. Combined with a refined interior and nicely supportive seats it’s a great little SUV to cover long distances in.

If you want to change your car entirely, use our Sell My Car service, where you can get the best price for your car. How much is the Volkswagen T-Cross? How much is the Volkswagen T-Cross? The VW T-Cross comes pretty well in the middle of the small SUV pack in terms of pricing. It's slightly more expensive than a SEAT Arona or Renault Captur, but beats out the Ford Puma and even the Skoda Kamiq. Good residual values mean impressive finance packages, too. In terms of trim levels, we'd skip the entry-level 'Life' trim - not because it's poorly equipped as it still has air-con, LED lights, a digital instrument cluster and a touchscreen with smartphone connectivity. For less than £200 extra, though, 'Match' trim adds a reversing camera, keyless entry and nicer alloy wheels, so it's a real no-brainer. The 'Style' model brings driving aids and built-in sat-nav, while the range-topping R-Line gets a sportier bodykit too. These upper trim levels are quite pricey, though. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort The VW T-Cross is great around town and competent down a twisty road, although we’d avoid the underpowered base petrol engine The T-Cross is compact and easy to drive, combining the benefits of a small family hatchback with the added advantage of a raised ride height. Forward visibility is further aided by large windows, although the thick rear pillars can obscure your view a bit when reversing. The T-Cross is small enough for this not to be much of an issue, and all but the entry-level SE trim get front and rear parking sensors. Ride quality is good, too, especially on the 17-inch wheels offered on the lower three trims. The basic 95hp engine only gets a five-speed manual gearbox, which feels a bit clunky - the six-speed gearbox of the 115hp engine makes it well worth the extra. The DSG automatic - available with the 115hp and 150hp engines - is great in traffic, but it can be a bit hesitant at parking speeds. The VW T-Cross copes well on the motorway, offering a supple ride quality, great visibility and plenty of driver aids as standard. You get adaptive cruise control , lane assist and blind spot detection on every trim. Like many small SUVs, there is a fair amount of wind noise at higher speeds, but overall refinement levels are good, and the seats are comfortable enough for long journeys. The base 95hp engine needs a lot of coaxing to get going and its five-speed manual leaves the engine revving quite high, making the more powerful 110hp or 150hp motors the better choice at motorway speeds. Considering it was designed first and foremost to be a practical, city-friendly SUV, the VW T-Cross does a good job down a twisty road. It grips well and doesn’t lean much around corners so your passengers shouldn’t get queasy. It's not exactly fun - you'll want a Ford Puma for that - but if you just want something that's competent and feels solid the T-Cross makes a good companion. Space and practicality Space and practicality This is one of the more spacious small SUVs, capable of seating four adults in comfort. Squeezing three passengers in the rear will be a challenge, though It may be small, but the VW T-Cross offers an impressive amount of interior space. The front seats have plenty of adjustment, including height and lumbar support. Leg and head room is good, too, and there’s a wide centre armrest that opens up to provide storage for items you prefer to keep out of sight. The door bins will accommodate 500ml bottles, and a pair of cupholders are placed behind the gear shifter. A spacious storage shelf at the base of the dashboard will easily take a phone or other loose items. The rear seats offer a decent amount of head room thanks to a squared-off rear end. And leg room is good too, as long as the occupants up front don’t push their seats all the way back. The rear seats are adjustable, allowing you to choose between more leg room or boot space depending on their position. The centre rear seat is narrow and the hump in the boot floor limits leg room, so is best suited for children. A set of ISOFIX anchor points are provided in the outer seats, getting your kids in and out is aided by the wide-opening rear doors. There is a small shelf in the back of the centre console that can be used for storing smaller items. You also get front seatback pockets and decently-sized door bins. The centre seatback doesn’t fold down, though. With the rear seats in their standard position, the VW T-Cross offers a decent 385 litres of boot space. That’s just below the SEAT Arona and Skoda Kamiq , which both offer 400 litres. However, with the rear seats pushed forward the load space increases to a more impressive 455 litres, and neither the Arona nor the Kamiq have that feature. The Renault Captur does, though, and it offers between 422 and 536 litres, depending on the setting. The available space in the T-Cross is still impressive though, and you get an adjustable boot floor that can either minimise the load lip or maximise the load space. The rear seats fold down in a 60:40 split to provide 1,281 litres of flat load area. That’s up there with the Renault Captur (1,275 litres) and the spacious Citroen C3 Aircross (1,289 litres). Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories You get a logically laid out cabin with an impressive amount of standard kit, although some areas still aren't as posh-feeling as you'd hope The T-Cross’s interior has an angular design style that is echoed across the air vents, driver binnacle and door handles. The overall look and feel is all very grown-up and a bit sombre compared to the funky designs of the Citroen C3 Aircross or Renault Captur, though Style trim does come with a really rather lovely blue dashboard trim and denim-style seat upholstery. The 2024 update for the T-Cross did address some of its previous problem areas - namely, the cheap plasticky feeling of the interior. While that's not totally gone - the top of the dash is still pretty hard - most of the places you touch are now premium-feeling enough. The door cards in particular feel much nicer. Base T-Cross models come fitted with an 8.0-inch touchscreen infotainment system, upgraded to 9.2-inches for upper trim levels. All models also get a digital dashboard too, with upper trim levels having a full-width affair with great clarity. Lower models have a smaller screen, though it's still clear and works well enough. The touchscreen is intuitive to use and has clear graphics with Bluetooth connectivity and DAB digital radio. Life and Match trims don’t get sat nav, but wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto is standard across the range which means you can use your smartphone’s navigation apps. Base trims get manual air conditioning controls, while the upper models have a digital climate control unit. This is really frustrating to use, and we can't help but feel like physical buttons would be much easier - or, save the space in the dash and put them in the touchscreen. You get a regular USB and newer USB-C charging socket up front, with two more USB sockets provided for the rear seat passengers. MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax The VW T-Cross is available with either a 95hp or 110hp turbocharged 1.0-litre petrol engine or a 150hp 1.5-litre turbocharged unit. Front-wheel-drive is standard on all trims. The 95hp version is paired solely with a five-speed manual transmission and goes from 0-62mph in 11.6 seconds. It will do an official 49.6mpg and emits 130g/km of CO2. These figures are nearly identical to the SEAT Arona and Skoda Kamiq, since they all share the same basic engine. The 110hp engine is available with a six-speed manual or seven-speed DSG automatic gearbox . In manual guise it will get to 62mph in a sprightly 10.8 seconds and consumes the same amount of fuel as the entry-level 95hp engine. Equipped with the automatic transmission, it accelerates to 62mph in a slightly slower 11.3 seconds and fuel economy drops to 45.6mpg. This is once again similar to both the Arona and Kamiq, as well as the similarly powerful petrol offered in the Citroen C3. Unlike the Renault Captur which offers both self-charging and plug-in hybrids , the T-Cross is petrol only. But even when equipped with the most powerful 150hp engine (available on SEL and R-Line trims), it is still impressively frugal. Overall fuel economy works out at 47.1mpg with 137g/km of CO2. The seven-speed DSG automatic is standard with this engine. It is capable of a rather rapid 8.5-second 0-62mph time, which is quicker than any engine option found in the Renault Captur and Citroen C3 Aircross. Safety and security Safety and security The VW T-Cross was awarded a full five-star Euro NCAP rating in 2019. It received a very impressive 97% for adult occupant safety and scored highly in every other category. Driver safety aids are comprehensive, with autonomous brake assist, adaptive cruise control, lane assist and blind spot detection all fitted as standard. All but the base 'Life' model even get a reversing camera. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems The T-Cross shares the majority of its components with other VW Group vehicles, so it should prove to be a reliable vehicle, however, recent reliability surveys haven’t seen it performing as well as some alternatives. You get a three-year/60,000-mile warranty, extendable by another 12 months. This is pretty standard amongst most manufacturers but well behind Kia’s seven-year/100,000-mile offering. There have been two recalls for the T-Cross so far, one for an instrument cluster software issue and another for potentially incorrectly fitted curtain airbags.

https://www.carwow.co.uk/volkswagen/id5,Volkswagen ID.5 Review & Prices,"€56,649",6/10,new,"Is the Volkswagen ID.5 a good car? Is the Volkswagen ID.5 a good car? Much like a Golden Retriever in a baseball cap and running shoes, the Volkswagen ID5 is the sporty-looking version of the sensible ID4 electric SUV . It’s much the same car, but where the ID4 has a big, boxy rear end the ID5 has a rakish roofline instead. You still get tall, bluff front and rear ends - a la ID4 - with big, aggressive head lights and curves aplenty. At the back is the same light bar too, but the ID5 has a little boot spoiler on the edge of the tailgate. It’s a decent looking thing, less frumpy than the ID4, though still less distinctive than the Audi Q4 e-tron Sportback and Skoda Enyaq Coupe . At first glance the interior is much the same fare as the outside, sleek and minimalistic with a few swoopy lines on the dashboard and a pair of modern-looking displays. It doesn’t take long to realise that the interior quality isn’t up to par though, with far too many scratchy, hard plastics in easy to reach places spoiling the cabin. Range: 226-344 miles Efficiency: 3.7-3.9 miles per kWh Battery size: 52kWh / 77kWh / 79kWh Max charge speed: 135kW Charge time AC: 12hrs, 0-100% at 7kW / 8hrs, 0-100% at 22kW Charge time DC: 30 mins, 20-80% at 135kW Charge port location: Left right Power outputs: 170hp / 286hp / 344hp It’s a shame as there are some really clever touches inside the ID5. The latest version of the infotainment is slick and easy to use, unlike some recent Volkswagen attempts, and the optional augmented reality head-up display is reassuring on the motorway as you don’t need to look away from the road as often. Yes the touchscreen climate controls are still a bit fiddly to use, but they don’t take long to get used to. The seats are especially comfortable with loads of adjustability, and there’s good front cabin storage including a deep centre console cubby and big door pockets. The rear bench is comfy, with good legroom and a surprisingly large amount of headroom for such a low roofline. It’s just a shame the boot’s shape is compromised by the sloping tailgate, because while it’s larger than the ID4’s at 549 litres, you can’t fit particularly boxy items in. Still, with a comfy interior and a big boot the ID5 makes for a great road trip EV, especially with a claimed range of up to 343 miles with the biggest battery. The entry-level model has a smaller battery with a max range of 226 miles. We managed respectable efficiency of 3.6mi/kWh on a long drive, largely on the motorway, in the long range model. That equates to a real-world range of 277 miles - 80% of Volkswagen’s claim. A twisty road is far from fun in the ID5 though, with steering that’s devoid of any sense of what the front wheels are doing. You need to put a lot of angle into turning the steering wheel, even in sport mode, so while there’s plenty of grip you’re best off driving the ID5 at a moderate pace. Motorways are much better, even if there’s a touch too much wind noise, but the clever suite of driving assistance tech combined with a good high-speed comfort make the ID5 an easy car to cover ground in. The city is where it feels most at home, though it’s a tricky car to place on the road. The bonnet lines make it hard to judge the ID5’s size, which combined with the slow steering and spongy brakes can knock your confidence when manoeuvring down a tight city street. Bigger bumps are absorbed rather effectively, but potholes and cracked roads aren’t smoothed out as well as they are in alternatives such as the Volvo EX30 and Kia EV6 . Good looks, useful practicality and real-world efficiency mean the ID5 is a perfectly adequate family SUV, but it does lose its shine thanks to some disappointing driving characteristics and questionable interior materials. Still, it’s worth considering, so you can check out our new Volkswagen ID5 deals or have a look at our ID5 leasing options instead. You can also browse used ID5s from our network of trusted dealers, or other used Volkswagens if you’re open to other options. When it’s time to switch, Carwow can even help you sell your current car . How much is the Volkswagen ID.5? How much is the Volkswagen ID.5? Volkswagen has dropped the price of the ID5 over its production run, which is good because it was initially listed similarly to the posher Audi Q4 e-tron Sportback - without the plush cabin. It’s still not cheap; the entry-level 226-mile ID5 Match Pure starts at more than the Kia EV6, which is a superior all rounder and has more range. You do get heated front seats and steering wheel as standard, as well as LED headlights and a rear view camera, but you’ll need the pricier Match Pro to get the bigger battery, LED taillights and upgraded Matrix headlights. The range-topping GTX has less range than the Match Pro at 327 claimed miles, but more power and more standard kit, including 20-inch wheels, three-zone climate control, sports suspension and an adjustable-height boot floor. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort The sporty looks don’t translate into a sporty drive, but the Volkswagen ID5 is a consummate cruiser and simple to drive around town The electric steering may be light and easy to flick around, but it’s actually rather slow - requiring a lot of input - which can be a bit annoying when navigating city streets, especially as you can’t see the ID5’s corners out the windscreen. It’s all very low effort though, with finger-light controls and a well-judged accelerator pedal. The raised driving position aids visibility ahead, although the angled rear roof section means a small rear window and a compromised view out the back. You do get surround parking sensors and a rear-view camera as standard to help with parking manoeuvres, but 360-degree cameras are unavailable on the Match Pure. The suspension is quite firm though, and while bigger potholes and speed bumps don’t unsettle the ID5, rougher road surfaces do transmit noise and vibration into the cabin. At motorway speeds the suspension feels as though it settles down and the ID5 cruises along with impressive levels of refinement. There is a bit of wind noise from the wing mirrors, noticeable here thanks to the silent electric drivetrain and lack of road noise. Adaptive cruise control and lane assist combine to make the ID5 a great long-distance companion, aided by the comfortable seats and airy cabin. The entry-level model does require some coaxing for overtaking manoeuvres at higher speeds, something you won’t have to worry about in the rapid twin-motor GTX version. There’s not a whole lot of fun to be had down a winding road in the ID5. The firm suspension limits body lean and outright grip is good, but it lacks that playful character that is more apparent in alternatives like the Ford Mustang Mach-E . It’s certainly not a deal-breaker in the context of a family-friendly electric SUV, but some alternatives such as the Cupra Tavascan and Hyundai Ioniq 5 manage to be both comfortable and more fun to drive. Space and practicality Space and practicality The ID5 offers plenty of passenger space, although the luggage compartment is a bit compromised The front seats are heated as standard and offer lots of adjustability, they even have their own armrests so there’s no awkward elbow-touching with your passenger. The steering wheel has the usual rake and reach adjustments, so getting the perfect driving position shouldn’t be an issue, and electrically adjustable seats are optional on Match Pro models but standard on the GTX. The interior comes with some handy storage spots, from large boor bins to big gulp-sized cup holders in the centre console. There’s a closable cubby just behind the cup holders and a tiny glovebox that can keep a few smaller items out of sight. The ID5 offers plenty of space in the back for a pair of adults or three teenagers, even for longer trips. The shallow roofline compromises headroom a bit for taller passengers compared to the ID4, but only by 5mm. The completely flat floor makes it easy to slide into the centre seat, and while it’s a bit narrower than the outer pews it’s still comfortable - and has its own headrest. Clearly marked ISOFIX mounting points are placed in the outer rear seats, and getting a baby seat in is aided by the wide-opening doors and the car’s raised height. There are some large door bins and front seat back pockets for storage, and the centre seat back also folds down to become an armrest, complete with a pair of cup holders. The ID5 has a generous 549 litres of boot space with the rear seats up. That’s actually six litres more than you get in the ID4 and way bigger than the 402 litres you get in a Ford Mustang Mach-E, although the Ford does have a small 81-litre storage compartment up front. The ID5 is also slightly more luggage-friendly than the Audi Q4 e-tron, which offers 535 litres. The loading area is nice and flat, with only a small loading lip which can be minimised even further with the standard adjustable boot floor. You get shopping hooks as standard, but a luggage net and partition only come on the range-topping GTX model, which is a bit cheeky. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories The clean and modern design is let down by too many cheap materials, though the infotainment is a highlight The ID5 is practically identical to the ID4 inside, so you get a thoroughly modern and uncluttered cabin with two digital screens mounted on the dashboard that give you access to the various on-board features. The ID5 only comes in Match Pure, Match Pro and GTX Edition trims, with the GTX having by far and away the most standard kit. Unfortunately, the hard plastics used on the doors, centre console and lower section of the dashboard are all the more disappointing in the higher-spec ID5s - especially when you look inside the cabins of the Audi Q4 e-tron and even the Nissan Ariya . The 12.9-inch infotainment screen offers sharp graphics, quick response times and all the features you could want at this level. That includes wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto , sat nav, DAB radio and over-the-air update capabilities. There’s also a wireless smartphone charger fitted to all trims. The touch-sensitive buttons along the bottom of the screen for the climate controls can be frustrating to use – especially while on the move. The steering wheel features similar haptic feedback pads which can be inadvertently activated while driving, and unfortunately the ID5 hasn’t received the latest button-operated steering wheel as per other Volkswagen models. A six-speaker, 140-watt audio system is standard, and an augmented reality head-up display is offered on all but the base trim. Electric range, charging and tax Electric range, charging and tax The ID5 is offered in three power outputs and battery sizes. The Match Pure has a single electric motor powering the rear wheels and it produces 170hp. This gives it an 8.9-second 0-62mph time; perfectly fine around town, but it does run out of puff on the motorway, so you may want to stretch to one of the more powerful versions if you spend a lot of time at higher speeds. The larger 77kWh battery pack translates into 344 miles of claimed range, though that’s still trailing behind the 390 miles that the extended range Ford Capri can manage. GTX Edition models get an additional electric motor for the front axle, which pushes power up to 344hp and reduces the 0-62mph sprint to 5.4 seconds. It also reduces the range slightly to 327 miles. The GTX feels far quicker than the single-motor models but it still lags behind the twin-motor Kia EV6 with its 0-62mph time of 3.5 seconds. Using a standard 7kW home wallbox will have the battery charged from 0-100% in around 12 hours. Find a 130kW public fast charger and you can zap the battery from 10-80% in just over 30 minutes. The all-electric ID5 benefits from a 0% Benefit-In-Kind tax rate, handy for company car buyers. Private buyers will pay £10 for the first year of Vehicle Excise Duty (VED), rising to £195 from the second year onwards. Safety and security Safety and security The Volkswagen ID4 was tested by Euro NCAP in 2021 and received a full five-star rating. These results apply to the ID5 as well, which means a 93% score for adult occupant safety, 89% for child occupants and a stellar 85% for safety assist devices. Standard active and passive safety devices include adaptive cruise control, road sign display, lane assist, rear-view camera and autonomous brake assist. The optional augmented reality head-up display is particularly useful for highlighting traffic activity in front of you in the dark. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems The Volkswagen ID range is still relatively new to the market and as such it is still too early to tell if there are any common long-term faults with the platform. That being said, Volkswagen came in a lowly 29th out of 32 manufacturers in the 2024 Driver Power reliability survey, which isn’t a confidence-inspiring result. The ID5 shares a lot of components with other Volkswagen Group products, but the fewer moving parts in an electric vehicle should in theory make it a reliable vehicle in the years to come. You get a three-year/60,000-mile warranty, extendable for an additional year. The high voltage battery pack comes with an eight-year/100,000-mile warranty. Volkswagen ID.5 FAQs Volkswagen ID.5 FAQs"

If you love the VW T-Roc but wish it had a bit more horsepower and an even more confusing name, you’re in luck. Volkswagen has opened the order books on the all-new VW T-Roc R – a jacked-up small SUV with the high-performance heart of the Golf R . On the outside, this speedy SUV shares plenty with the standard VW T-Roc . It gets a similar chunky silhouette, chrome trims and a contrasting roof, but the front bumper has been given a helpful does of air intakes to help cool its much more powerful engine. Nip round the back – past a set of new 18-inch alloy wheels – and you’ll notice four large exhaust pipes, a new roof-mounted spoiler and a customary R badge on the boot lid. Inside, the changes are just as easy to spot. There’s a sporty steering wheel for starters, alongside a few carbon-fibre trims and some more supportive sports seats pinched from – you guessed it – the Golf R. Space in the back is unchanged from the standard VW T-Roc, so things are a bit cramped for three tall adults and there’s room in the boot for a few suitcases, but not too much else. More exciting than how much you can cram behind the seats, though, is what sits under the VW T-Roc R’s bonnet. Rather than the standard T-Roc’s most powerful 190hp 1.5-litre engine, this R model comes with a 300hp 2.0-litre unit that drives all four wheels through a seven-speed automatic gearbox. With the accelerator pinned and launch control engaged, this high-riding SUV will reach 60mph from rest in less than 4.9 seconds, making it a smidgen slower than the VW Golf R and Audi SQ2, but quicker than the Cupra Ateca . To make sure it isn’t just fast in a straight line, the VW T-Roc R also gets upgraded brakes, lowered suspension and a Race driving mode that tweaks the responsiveness of the accelerator and gearbox.

https://www.carwow.co.uk/dacia/logan-mcv-stepway,Dacia Logan MCV Stepway Review and Prices,"€16,261",5/10,new,"On paper, the Dacia Logan Stepway comes with a very generous supply of safety features, including Hill Start Assist – which keeps the footbrake applied as you move your foot to the gas pedal – cruise control, rear parking sensors, a speed limiter, and driver, passenger and side airbags. There’s also an emergency brake assist system that automatically slows the car if you’re on your way to having a low-speed crash. The infotainment system is comprised of a 7.0-inch touchscreen display, which has a DAB digital radio, built-in satnav and Apple CarPlay/Android Auto compatibility as standard. That’s an impressive list of equipment, then – you’d need to buy a top-of-the-range Tipo to compete with that, which starts from £19,850. There may only be one trim available for the Stepway, but the features you get with it rival a top-of-the-range Tipo. Despite there only being a single variant of the Logan MCV Stepway, the car has two engine options: a 0.9-litre, 90hp petrol and a 1.5-litre, 95hp diesel. Both engines are economical, but the latter is a better bet if you’re frequently driving on the motorway, where it will return better fuel economy. That said, the petrol is marginally quicker from 0 to 62mph (12.4 seconds versus the diesel’s 12.6). We’re yet to drive the Dacia Logan MCV Stepway, but we’ll have driving impressions for you just as soon as we have."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/dacia/sandero,Dacia Sandero Review & Prices,"€19,264",8/10,new,"Is the Dacia Sandero a good car? Is the Dacia Sandero a good car? As cars get more complicated and expensive, the Dacia Sandero’s no-frills approach is quite refreshing. It’s a budget small car which you could consider instead of the Renault Clio or Vauxhall Corsa , but it’s much cheaper than either of them. It’s a bit like comparing a white T-shirt from GAP to one from Asda George - both do the same job, neither will turn many heads but one is way more affordable. Just like a white T-shirt, the Sandero is a smart-looking thing, but it won’t make you stand out in a crowded car park. If you do want to add a splash of colour , you’ll have to pay extra for any shade beyond white. If you want to elevate your Sandero even more, both figuratively and literally, there’s a jacked-up Stepway version which has a faux-SUV vibe about it. No matter how you look at it though, it’s not as exciting as the stylish Peugeot 208 . You’re in for a pleasant surprise when you step inside, because the Dacia Sandero has a nice interior for such an affordable car. There’s no disguising its budget roots thanks to the swathes of hard black plastic, but the clever fabric on the dashboard lifts things nicely and it feels really solidly built. It’s a spacious cabin as well. The driving position is spot-on and gives you a great view out, although the seats aren’t all that supportive so you may get a touch of backache after a few hours behind the wheel. There won’t be any complaints from your rear seat passengers either, because there’s plenty of room back there for such a small car. The Sandero’s boxy profile allows for good headroom, although a Skoda Fabia is slightly more spacious. The same goes for the boot, which is about average for this sort of car, but it falls short of both the Fabia and the Volkswagen Polo . Basic versions of the Sandero are pretty spartan inside. There’s no central screen, just a mounting point for your phone, and it gets steel wheels as well. You do still get cruise control and a DAB radio as standard, but you’ll probably want to step up to the mid-spec version to get a touchscreen infotainment system with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto . Out on the road the Dacia Sandero will ferry you from A to B with minimal fuss. The steering is a bit vague, but it’s really light which makes the car easy to slot through tight car parks. It’s also comfortable on the motorway with an acceptable amount of wind and road noise for a car at this price point. Choosing an engine for your Sandero is easy, because there are just two of them. The entry-level 90hp 1.0-litre petrol is peppy enough and will easily return 50mpg in the real world, and there’s also a 100hp option which can run on LPG - a cheaper fuel than petrol. All cars get a slick five-speed manual gearbox as standard, and a CVT automatic is available on top-spec Journey models. It’s an adequate gearbox, but the manual is better for extracting as much performance from the Sandero as possible. The Dacia Sandero may not be the most stylish small car out there, but there’s a refreshing honesty about it which makes it very easy to like. This is an affordable car which isn’t pretending to be anything but, and it’s spacious and good to drive. If the Dacia Sandero tickles your fancy, browse the latest Sandero deals to see how much you can save. You can also check out used Sanderos , the latest lease deals or have a look at the best Dacia deals . If you need to sell your car , you can do that through Carwow as well. How much is the Dacia Sandero? How much is the Dacia Sandero? The Sandero is currently the cheapest new car you can buy in the UK. It's a couple of thousand pounds cheaper than the smaller Kia Picanto , and the MG3 is also a fair whack more expensive. Alternatives like the Volkswagen Polo, Renault Clio and the Ford Fiesta may offer more refinement, but they all cost considerably more in base trim. With such a massive saving, we would opt for a Sandero in top Expression trim which adds just £1000 to the base price and includes some desirable features like keyless entry, 8.0-inch media display and electric rear windows. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort The Sandero offers decent performance around town and the soft suspension copes well with rough road surfaces, but it’s not one for the more enthusiastic driver The Dacia Sandero is a great choice for trips around town, it has light (if slightly lifeless) steering, a comfort-orientated suspension set-up and enough poke to zip into gaps in traffic. The driving position is good, with decent visibility, and the optional automatic transmission helps take the stress out of the daily commute. Rear parking sensors and a rearview camera are standard on the top Expression trim, but the car is compact enough not to need them. The new Dacia Sandero is a step up from its forebear, with much-improved refinement at motorway speeds. You do have to work the engine to get up to speed, and it can be quite noisy as the revs rise, but it settles down nicely once you're cruising along. There's a bit of wind noise, but nothing unbearable. You’ll get a quieter ride in some pricier alternatives, but the Sandero copes well on long journeys and is spacious enough to accommodate four adults and a few small bags at the same time. The soft suspension settings that give the Sandero its forgiving ride quality around town mean that enthusiastic cornering is not its forte. It grips the road well but the body will lean in the bends when taken at speed, something that you’re not exactly likely to do in this car anyway. The 90hp petrol engine is willing but not really suited to this sort of more enthusiastic driving; a SEAT Ibiza is far more fun on a twisty road. Space and practicality Space and practicality The Sandero is spacious enough for four adults although it’s not quite as practical as a Skoda Fabia The driver won’t have any trouble getting comfortable behind the adjustable steering wheel, and although there aren’t any electric controls here, the seats offer plenty of movement to find a good spot. The front passenger seat doesn’t offer height adjustment, but there is a small armrest and plenty of head and legroom. A set of cupholders are built into the centre console and there’s space for a mobile phone ahead of the gear lever, but the door bins are pretty small, as is the glovebox. The rear seats are comfy, too, with enough space for two adults or a set of baby seats which can be affixed to the two outer ISOFIX mountings. Headroom and kneeroom are surprisingly good, and although the middle rear seat is a bit tight for larger passengers, three kids will fit across the rear bench. A solitary cupholder is provided for passengers in the back, although there are a couple of USB points to charge your phone. You get 328 litres of boot space with the rear seats up, which is more generous than the 286 litres you get in the Toyota Yaris , but slightly less than the Skoda Fabia's 380 litres. Fold the 60:40 split rear seats down and you get 1,108 litres in total – again falling in the middle of its class. The boot opening is wide but there is a hefty lip to lift heavy things over, plus the boot floor isn’t completely flat either. You do get a few handy hooks for bags, though, and there is a space under the boot floor for the optional spare wheel. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories A modern interior and some stylish touches belie the Sandero’s budget market positioning, but there's no hiding the sea of black plastics Because of its price, you might think the interior will feel cheap and incredibly dated. However, even the entry-level Essential trim looks a tad more upmarket than you might expect, with clear analogue dials, sharp horizontal lines across the dashboard and a decent level of fit-and-finish. There are still vast swathes of hard plastic throughout the cabin, but it manages to avoid looking like it has been built down to a price. The Expression trim adds a leather-covered steering wheel, funky-looking fabric on the dashboard, plusher seat material and an 8.0-inch infotainment touchscreen – the base model requires you to use your smartphone instead. The screen incorporates a rear camera to go along with the parking sensors that are also part of the Expression trim. The system is simple enough to use and offers Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity if you prefer to use your own apps. Smart rotary knobs control the heating and ventilation system and the steering wheel is equipped with buttons for the cruise control, while the audio system gets its own stubby adjustment stalk below the wiper controls. A 12-volt socket and USB port are located below the temperature controls and the top trim even gets keyless entry. MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax You have a choice of two engines; a petrol and a petrol/ LPG bi-fuel option. Both are 1.0-litre units that are priced the same, with similar performance and economy, so choosing between them essentially comes down to whether you think you're likely to ever fill up with liquefied petroleum gas. There's a second tank for the LPG and you can switch between the two fuels. LPG costs less than petrol, but it's not always easy to find. Want more specifics? Of course you do. Well the bi-fuel model has a bit more power, running at 100hp on LPG, while both make 90hp on petrol power. Top speeds are about 110mph following a leisurely 0-60mph time of around 12 seconds, which isn't terrible for a car in this segment. You're also looking at around 53mpg, so running costs will be low regardless of which engine you go for, while the circa-110g/km CO2 emissions mean first-year tax rates aren't too bad either. Safety and security Safety and security The latest Dacia Sandero is a big step up from the previous model, not least because it’s now based on the current Renault Clio underpinnings. You might expect this to mean that it would achieve the same five-star Euro NCAP safety rating as the Clio, but unfortunately the Dacia Sandero Stepway (the high-riding version of the Sandero) scored a lowly two-star rating. The regular Sandero hasn't been tested, but it's identical in most ways. While the 70% and 71% adult and child occupant safety ratings are passable, the poor 42% score for advanced driver assistance systems let it down. For what it’s worth, were it not for the limited efficiency of the automatic emergency braking system, the Sandero Stepway would have received a four-star rating. All Sandero models come with hill start assist, advanced emergency braking (although only effective in avoiding other cars and not pedestrians or cyclists), six airbags and cruise control. The Expression trim adds keyless entry, a rearview camera and rear parking sensors. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems The tried-and-tested components used in Dacia models have meant that they tend to be reliable cars. Reliability surveys have seen the Sandero score very highly, often in the top three positions, putting it ahead of far posher brands. All Dacia Sandero models are covered by a three-year/60,000-mile warranty, but if you continue servicing your car at a Dacia approved retailer than you can unlock up to seven years and 75,000 miles of cover, in a similar vein to Toyota's 'Relax' warranty. That offers up to ten years of cover, though, while MG and Kia both have seven-year warranties with no service-linked requirements."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/dacia/duster,Dacia Duster Review & Prices,"€27,325",9/10,new,"Is the Dacia Duster a good car? Is the Dacia Duster a good car? The Dacia Duster is a byword for practicality, value and toughness - and has been since the first-generation model launched in the UK in 2010. The second-generation car had more of the same but was a much nicer vehicle to live with day-to-day, and now the new third-generation Duster has upped the ante once more. It’s still as rugged and useful for family life as it ever was, but now has refreshed looks, an extra degree of sophistication and even the option of a hybrid engine for the first time. It's so good, and such fantastic value, that it's the winner of the Smart Spender category in the 2025 Carwow Car of the Year Awards . Its pumped-up styling makes it look like a high-tech walking boot for the road. And just like a walking boot, the Duster is ideally suited for rough terrain, as it’s part of a dwindling group of small SUVs available with four-wheel drive. Alternatives for the Duster are universally more expensive and less durable, but include small SUVs such as the Volkswagen T-Cross , Renault Captur and Peugeot 2008 . The 4x4 variant has even fewer models to do battle with, rivalling only the Jeep Renegade and Suzuki Ignis . Lots of the new styling touches are really practical. The plastic cladding along the front and sides should protect from errant trollies in supermarket car parks, with the material on the front and rear being the same colour all the way through - which means scratches and scrapes won’t show as much. Other plastics used on the exterior are made of a recycled material Dacia’s calling ‘Starkle’, keen to bolster the car’s eco-credentials. Inside, the new Duster is much more sophisticated than the old model. The entry-level car just comes with a phone mount in the centre, but the next trim up brings a touchscreen infotainment system with wireless smartphone connectivity. It also comes with a 7.0-inch digital dashboard display, making for a surprisingly slick and high-tech looking dashboard. Dacia’s value roots become obvious when you start poking around - you won’t find soft-touch plastics anywhere in the Duster’s interior. Everything feels hard wearing, though, and interesting textures mean it looks quite cool - we really like the rubber floor mats, which are designed to look like map contours. The robust surfaces should prove well up to the rigours of family life, or adventuring - they’ll withstand a lot of punishment, and wipe clean easily. It’s also really spacious for a small SUV, with space for six-foot adults in the rear and a big, square boot with some useful underfloor storage. The Duster’s transformation continues with the introduction of its first hybrid engine. It’s the same system as you’ll find in the Dacia Jogger hybrid , and it’s extremely efficient as well as being much smoother in town. Other engines available are a mild hybrid petrol, which will be available with four-wheel drive, and a lower-powered entry-level unit that can run on either petrol or cheaper LPG. It’s a shame that there’s no longer a hyper-economical diesel engine, but you’ll be able to forgive that when you feel how the new Duster drives. It feels much more reassuring than the old car with firmer suspension that doesn’t bounce you over bumps so much.

Value is always a given with Dacia, so it’s great that the base-model Duster comes in at well below £20,000 - that’s cheaper than most small hatchbacks. That price is for the fairly Spartan ‘Essential’ model, though, which only comes with the 100hp bi-fuel engine. For most people, the Essential with the 130hp 1.2-litre engine is a better bet, but that still costs from just over £21,000. The cheapest model with four-wheel drive costs just under £24,000, while the cheapest full hybrid costs just over that. Dacia’s finance packages don’t always have the most favourable interest rates, but the low list price means monthly costs are often still far cheaper than comparably sized SUVs. Four trim levels will be offered. Essential includes rear parking sensors, air-conditioning and fixed roof bags, but does without a central touchscreen or alloy wheels. Expression is the next step up and has 17-inch alloys, a 7.0-inch digital dashboard and 10.1-inch centre touchscreen with a reversing camera and smartphone connectivity. Above this you can go in two different directions. The Extreme model is a bit more rugged, and has washable upholstery, rubber floor mats, climate control, Dacia’s clever modular roof bars and keyless entry. The Journey model also has climate control and keyless entry, but also has foglights, 18-inch alloy wheels and an upgraded sound system. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort A good range of engines and much nicer to drive than before - shame the diesel’s no longer available The new Duster is much smoother to drive in town than the previous model, particularly if you opt for the 1.6-litre hybrid engine - because this allows you to coast along silently on electric power alone. The other engines aren’t bad, though, and all models benefit from the Duster’s upgraded suspension, which is firmer than it was before. Though this means it doesn’t iron out bumps quite as well as a Peugeot 2008, it doesn’t bounce around as much as the old car did, which means a less sickness-inducing ride for your passengers. Visibility isn’t the best, thanks to a shallower window line and narrow rear windscreen. But all models above the base car do get a reversing camera, and the turning circle and light steering do mean the new Duster is pretty manoeuvrable in town. All versions of the Duster do need a bit of a boot getting up to motorway speeds. The basic 100hp bi-fuel engine is likely to feel quite gutless indeed, but the 130hp 1.2 and the 140hp hybrid have ample power considering the Duster’s light weight - they just occasionally need working harder than, say, the 150hp engine of a Volkswagen T-Roc. Once you’re up to speed, the Duster feels very stable and secure, albeit slightly noisier than alternatives thanks to less sound deadening. All the hard plastics on the interior do tend to amplify the sound, too, and the hybrid in particular can sound quite coarse when it’s revving high. It’s much quieter than the diesel used to be, though. You’re not going to mistake the Duster for a hot hatchback any time soon, but with the stiffer suspension it feels much more precise and controlled than before. It stays flatter in bends, instead of leaning like a ship, though it does feel like it fidgets about a bit over rougher surfaces. Four-wheel drive models have more sophisticated rear suspension which should improve comfort levels slightly, as well as the benefit of those driven rear wheels helping to push you out of bends and adding traction when the roads are slippery. Space and practicality Space and practicality Roomy for its size, but the Duster is still a small SUV Practicality is a high point for the Dacia Duster. The rear seats have plenty of space and the boot is larger than some cars from the size above. The driver’s seat does have height adjustment, but it misses out on additional features such as an extendable seat base, and the lumbar support can’t be adjusted up and down. The front seats are squashy and comfortable but don’t feel as though they’d hold you in place while cornering. The hard wearing upholstery appears more expensive than you’d expect given the Duster’s budget leanings, though. There are plenty of storage slots for odds and ends, including a shelf perfectly sized for your smartphone, a pair of cupholders and large door bins. There’s also a clever modular system called YouClip that Dacia’s developed, with mounting points across the cabin and boot - you’ll be able to attach clamps, phone or tablet holders or even lights. Expect to see a whole range of Dacia accessories developed to fit this in the future. The rear doors open nice and wide, and the flat rear bench lends itself well to accommodating three adults - assuming they can fit width-wise. It’s comfortable for two six-footers, though, even if they’re sat behind a driver of a similar size. Headroom is generous and the big windows give a great view out. There’s USB-C charging available for rear passengers, as well as one of the aforementioned mounting points - ideal for mounting a tablet so that those in the back can watch a movie or play a game on a long journey. Boot space varies depending on the model you select. Two-wheel drive petrol models get 472 litres of space, which is one of the biggest boots in a car of this size - more than the 385 litres of the Volkswagen T-Cross or 400 litres of the Skoda Kamiq . Four-wheel drive and hybrid models lose some capacity as they have mechanicals to accommodate under the rear - raising the boot floor by a few inches. The rear seats fold easily with tabs on the top edge, but they do leave a significant hump in the load floor when flat. They go down in a 60:40 split, and there are bag hooks and an optional rubber liner to keep the carpet clean. Adventurous sorts will enjoy the optional Sleep Pack, which takes the form of a bespoke wooden box in the rear. Using the dropped seat backs, you’ll be able to fold out a double bed for comfortable in-car camping. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories Hard wearing and well-built, but far from plush Basic models of the Dacia Duster really live up to that title - they don’t even get a central infotainment screen. Instead, you get a mount for your phone in the middle of the dashboard, from which you can run a bespoke Dacia app or your own choice of sat nav and media. The car does still have a radio if you don’t want to plug in your phone; you can control this via the small screen in the instrument panel and the buttons on the steering wheel. Most models come with a 10.1-inch touchscreen instead, which is much brighter, slicker and better-looking than in any Dacia that’s come before this. It offers wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto as well as displaying the reversing camera, while top-spec models also get built-in sat nav. The overall style is sort of cyberpunk meets lumberjack. It’s clearly designed for hard work outdoors, with rubber floor mats, wipe-clean surfaces and nice touches like off-road specific information available on the infotainment screen. But it’s also quite cool and angular, and uses interesting textures and patterns to hide the fact that the materials are quite a long way from plush. Though the steering wheel and gear selector feel posh enough in the hand, areas such as the door cards and armrests are made entirely of hard, unyielding plastics. These will no doubt stand up to some real punishment but they don’t conjure up a very premium feel - nor are they that nice to touch. That is to be expected given the car’s price, though. MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax MPG figures for the Dacia Duster aren’t half bad considering the car’s spacious interior and blocky silhouette. The 1.2-litre petrol officially returns 51mpg, or 46mpg if you opt for the four-wheel drive version. You should be able to achieve reasonably close to this on a long run, though it will inevitably drop if you spend lots of time in town. The hybrid model officially returns 55mpg, and we’ve found 50mpg to be very achievable. This model doesn’t lose too much economy in stop-start traffic, either, as it cycles between petrol and electric running to make the most out of it. We’ve seen well over 60mpg from this engine in other Renault and Dacia cars, so with careful use you should be able to eke out more than the claimed figure. The Bi-Fuel 1.0-litre could be an interesting proposition if you live close to an LPG filling station. LPG is typically around half the price of petrol, and could result in much lower running costs. It returns an official figure of 43mpg when running on petrol, and around 35mpg on LPG - so savings could be significant. This engine is however only available on the very cheapest Duster. The hybrid offers the lowest CO2 emissions of the Duster’s engines at 114g/km, and so the lowest road tax or company car rates. Opting for a higher trim level or a 4x4 variant will see emissions increase, with a corresponding rise in tax - though at 135g/km for the petrol 4x4, it’s not too shabby all round. Safety and security Safety and security Dacia’s official Euro NCAP scores often suffer as the firm tends to shy away from fitting active driver aids to keep costs low. And so it proves with the latest Duster, which has scored three stars out of five in safety testing. Child occupant protection is pretty good at 84%, but the 70% adult occupant score is quite disappointing. Despite scoring poorly for driver assist technology, the new Duster comes equipped with all the basics as they’re now required by European law - so you get autonomous emergency braking, traffic sign recognition with a speed alert, lane-keeping assist, driver attention monitoring and rear parking sensors. It’s also nice that Dacia fits an easy shortcut to turn the more annoying of these features off with just two presses, so you don’t have to root through menus. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems Historically Dacia’s no-nonsense engineering has led to reasonable reliability - less to go wrong! The new Duster introduces a lot more software and safety systems to the fray, but the engines and oily bits are well-proven and should be pretty dependable. Dacia's Zen warranty gives you up to seven years of cover, provided you continue to service your car at an approved Dacia retailer. The mileage limit for this is 75,000 miles. As standard, you get three years of cover, with a further four unlockable through the Zen program. That's really good, and matches all but the very best on sale - MG and Kia both have seven-year warranties, but Toyota has a similar service-linked policy offering up to a decade of cover.

https://www.carwow.co.uk/dacia/jogger,Dacia Jogger Review & Prices,"€25,316",9/10,new,"Is the Dacia Jogger a good car? Is the Dacia Jogger a good car? If you’re after a practical, seven-seat family car but don’t want to fork out for an expensive SUV or a bulbous people carrier , then take a look at the Dacia Jogger. At a glance, this looks like a regular estate car, but it’s big, chunky and spacious like an SUV. It’s a bit like those Russian matryoshka dolls. The big ones look a lot like the small ones, but open them up and they can fit a lot more inside. Combining SUV and MPV practicality, the Jogger has been designed so that seven people can sit in comfort throughout – yes, even in the rearmost seats. That said, don’t expect to find a first-class cabin that’s all posh leather and wood panelling. The Jogger’s interior is simple and hard-wearing, and perhaps a bit cheap-feeling in places. But then this is an extremely affordable car , and when it comes to value for money, it hits the nail on the head. Where the Jogger really impresses is how roomy it is. You’d be hard-pressed to find more headroom in a cathedral, and there’s loads of space in the second row (and even the third row) for taller adults to stretch out comfortably. Of course, boot space takes a hit when you’ve got seven people in the car. But by folding down the rearmost seats – which are also easily removable – you’ll easily be able to fit more than a couple of chunky suitcases back there, even though those seats don’t fold flat into the floor. With its no-frills price tag, you get a pretty no-frills set of standard equipment at the entry-level. Air conditioning, metallic trim detailing and 16-inch steel wheels with covers are included, but to get an infotainment system you need to download an app onto your smartphone. But at least there’s a built-in smartphone cradle you can then use to hold your phone in place. Of course, if a properly spartan version of the Jogger isn’t really your bag, you can always upgrade. The range-topper doesn’t cost a huge amount more, and it gets things like heated seats, cruise control , LED headlights and a proper infotainment system. The mid-range specifications are a good compromise of keeping costs low without sacrificing some luxuries here and there. There are two engine choices, starting with a 1.0-litre petrol with 110hp that’s paired to a six-speed manual, and which can take you from 0-60mph in around 11 seconds. That’s enough punch when you’ve got one passenger on board, but with a full car you’ll likely find you struggle to make swift progress. Better is the hybrid version, which has a 1.6-litre petrol engine and an electric motor that make a more load-friendly 140hp. It’s still not rapid, but it’s more economical, and is the only way to get a Jogger with an automatic gearbox. Either way, the Jogger is comfortable. Sure, it might not be the sportiest or the most refined car in the world, but then again it’s not meant to be. The manual gear shift is smooth, and the Jogger doesn’t feel so chunky that squeezing into tight parking spaces will cause you to break out in a cold sweat. This is a very easy car to drive, and to see out of. On the motorway, it makes for a good cruiser too. Yes there’s a bit of wind noise, and yes, you’ll notice that the petrol version feels a touch underpowered. But otherwise, the Jogger makes for easy sailing. All up, the Dacia Jogger is an extremely likeable car. It’s cheap to run, supremely practical, comfortable and very charmingly simple to use and to live with. So if it sounds like it could be the car for you, head on over to our Dacia Jogger deals page to see how much you can save when you buy through Carwow. If you're interested in a used Dacia Jogger then you're in luck, head over to our used page to check out the latest offerings, or browse other used Dacia models. You can sell your car easily through Carwow, too. How much is the Dacia Jogger? How much is the Dacia Jogger? The Dacia Jogger is so comically affordable that they’re almost giving it away. Well, compared to its direct competition, anyway, of which there are… er… not many. Most car makers have stopped making the sort of practical seven-seat MPVs that the Jogger theoretically competes with, preferring to build chunkier SUV with their desirable high driving positions. The closest alternatives to the Jogger are the seven-seat versions of the Volkswagen Caddy and Ford Tourneo Connect , but even those van-based vehicles are considerably more expensive. A Citroen e-Berlingo , Peugeot e-Rifter and Vauxhall Combo Life Electric cost a good chunk more than even a fully loaded Jogger because of their electric engines. The Skoda Kodiaq and Peugeot 5008 are well-priced, seven-seat SUVs but, you guessed it, still cost quite a bit more than the Jogger. If you need to carry seven people around, and you’re on a tight budget, there really isn’t anything else. And if you only need five, the third row is easily removed and stored away for extra boot space in five-seat mode. Provided you’ve got somewhere to keep a couple of seats from a car. Three trim levels let you go from super-basic and affordable to, well, well-equipped and affordable. The Essential trim is the cheapest way into a Jogger but you still get air conditioning and electric windows, so it’s not like you have to sacrifice all creature comforts. There is an 8.0-inch media display, but there’s no built-in infotainment, instead you have to plug your phone in to use Apple CarPlay or Android Auto . Expression and Extreme are much more popular because you get stuff like parking sensors, reversing camera, automatic wipers and heated seats, depending on model. Hybrids are only available with these two trims, and add a digital driver display. It’s also worth noting that the hybrid version is more expensive than the petrol, by about £3,000. You’ll have to decide whether the automatic gearbox and digital dashboard, coupled with potential running cost savings, make it worth the extra. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort The Dacia Jogger is easy to drive whichever engine you choose, but the base petrol is rather gutless for motorway overtaking The Jogger is great at absorbing bumps, so this is a pretty easy-going car around town. Actually, the Jogger puts plenty of significantly more expensive cars to shame when it comes to dealing with lumpy Tarmac. The steering is light, which helps when tucking into tight spaces, but the turning circle is a bit big — 11.7-metres — which means you have to take your time with small roundabouts. The view out is great, as you sit relatively high up with big back windows, decent door mirrors, and not too much in the way of blind spots. In petrol cars, the gearshift is light, if a little notchy and the only problem really is a slightly stodgy feeling to the clutch. The hybrid has a slick automatic gearbox, while the engine is happy pootling around quietly on electric power at lower speeds, making it the more relaxing of the two. Opt for the petrol and its motorway performance is fine up to a point, but you’ll really notice that it’s lacking for outright performance, especially if you’ve filled your Jogger with people and luggage. If you’re trying to overtake on the motorway, it’s really slow and laborious — watching the speedo needle when you accelerate in sixth gear is like watching the hour hand on a clock… The hybrid is a bit better here. It’s not what you’d call quick, but it’s easier to get up to speed. On the flip side, it can be quite noisy under acceleration, which is particularly noticeable when you put your foot down on a slip road, for example. However, noise isn’t much of an issue when you’re cruising. Both engines settle into the background noise at speed, while road and tyre roar are kept to reasonable levels. There’s not even much wind noise around the door mirrors. Has Dacia managed to make this practical seven-seater a dynamite drive on a country road? Has it given the Jogger the kind of steering sharpness and chassis poise we’d expect of a BMW M3? No, of course not, but it’s fun to imagine, isn’t it? All the Jogger has to do on a twisty road is be comfortable and secure, and that it most certainly manages. There’s enough grip and enough ‘goes-where-you-point-it-ness’ from the somewhat vague, light steering that you’ll have plenty of confidence in your Jogger and that's what counts. It’s fine, and to be honest that’s all it has to be. The key phrase here is ‘for what it is’, and in that sense the Jogger is hugely impressive. True, the Skoda Octavia Estate is a well-priced and massively spacious car that’s much more engaging through a series of corners, but then you can’t get seven people in an Octavia… Space and practicality Space and practicality The Dacia Jogger is impressively spacious for passengers in all rows, but the lack of USB sockets in the back is a shame Dacia has kept practicality to the fore — there’s a glove box (that’s admittedly on the small side), door bins that can hold a one-litre drinks bottle, and another small storage space under the front-seat armrest. There’s also a spot for your phone, plus USB and 12-volt sockets, in front of the gear lever. The driving position is good, with plenty of in-out, up-down adjustment for the steering wheel. On the outside, there are standard roof rails which can not only take a roof box but which can pop-out and be turned sideways across the roof to hold a bike rack. Space in the back is the Jogger’s whole reason for existing. There’s a step in the roofline — that’s actually reminiscent of an old Land Rover Discovery — which means that even though the back seats are set higher up than the fronts (stadium-style seating, apparently) there’s plenty of room for heads, and legroom is decent too. You get room enough for three people sitting side-by-side in the back at a bit of a squeeze, and while there is a transmission hump, but it’s small so there’s enough room for everyone’s feet. The doors open nice and wide so there’s enough room to get a big child seat in there, and ISOFIX anchors in the outer two seats help too. The rear bench splits, folds, and slides in a 60:40 ratio, which isn’t quite as good as having three individual rear seats, but it’s good enough. There’s a 12-volt socket, some folding picnic tables, and decent-sized door bins too. No USB sockets in the back, though. That’s a shame. In the third row is the Jogger’s real party trick — enough space for even full-grown adults to get comfortable. Try doing that in a Skoda Kodiaq… Those in the third row get their own cupholders, a 12-volt socket (which might be more useful if you buy a USB adapter) and the little windows at the back pop-open for some extra ventilation. The second-row seats fold forward out of the way to make back seat entry easier, but taller passengers will have to hunch over to get in and it’s easy to bang your head on the way in. With seven seats in use, there’s still 160 litres of luggage space, which is enough for two carry-on style suitcases. The third row doesn’t fold flat into the floor, but instead the backs of the seats fold flat and — by using some fiddly and awkward little levers — you can tumble them forward to lean against the backs of the middle row. Then you’ve got a massive 700 litres of space to play with. Pull some more levers and you can actually remove the rear seats entirely. They weigh 10kg each so they’re pretty easy for one person to move about. Need more space? Well, the middle row also folds and tumbles (again, it’s a bit of a fiddly faff to do but easier than row three….). Now you’ve got 2,085-litres of space — more than you’d get in some vans. There’s even a little holder for the rear seatbelt buckles so that the belts don’t get in the way. A Peugeot 5008 or Skoda Kodiaq have simpler, easier seat folding systems but then they’re bigger and more expensive. For context, these cars have 270 litres and 167 litres in seven-seat mode respectively, or 630 litres and 952 litres with the third row folded. As you can see, the Jogger holds its own. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories The Dacia Jogger’s interior materials and equipment feel acceptable for the price, but you do have to accept plenty of cheap plastics The Jogger’s cabin looks and feels nicer than you’d expect from the price tag. Yes, there’s lots of cheap plastic but on higher-spec models you get nice squidgy fabric trim on the dashboard and seats, which lifts everything up a bit. Even the climate control buttons look and feel good — similar to those in a £100,000 Audi R8 … Basic versions come with a simple solution for an infotainment screen — a clamp that holds your mobile phone in place, and an app that connects it to the Jogger’s touchscreen display. With Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, you have all of the media and maps connectivity you need, so it doesn’t feel like much of a sacrifice. You don’t get steering wheel controls, but instead a little ‘satellite’ set of buttons behind the steering wheel which come from an early-2000s Renault (Dacia’s parent company). It works, but it’s a bit fiddly. The main instruments – a plain black-and-white digital trip computer – are simple and unfussy, which we like. You do get a digital dash in the hybrid model, which really helps elevate things to feel more modern. Top-spec models get a six-speaker stereo system that may not have the crispest sound quality, but which at least is properly loud — not something you can say for every cheap car on the market. This trim also includes an integrated infotainment and map system, which could be appealing if you don’t like the idea of relying on your phone. One odd thing — the magnification effect on the rear view mirror is completely different to that on the door mirrors, so something that looks a reasonable distance away in the door mirrors looks alarmingly close-up when you look in the rear view. MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax All Dacia Jogger trim levels can be specified with a 1.0-litre, 109hp turbocharged three-cylinder petrol that’s pretty familiar from the Sandero , the Duster , and lots of Renault products too. You’ll find it’s underpowered on motorways, especially if you’ve filled all the seats and the boot. It has CO2 emissions starting from 130g/km, which means that you’re looking at the middle of the price range to tax your Jogger for the first year, which perhaps isn’t great for a car sold on its value for money. The 140hp hybrid is more efficient, with CO2 emissions of 112g/km meaning it costs a bit less to tax in year one, but not much. At least the standard 1.0-litre engine is economical. Dacia claims that it’ll do 48.7mpg on average, and that’s exactly what we got out of it — well, 48.5mpg if we’re being precise. The hybrid? That promises 56.5mpg and we saw about 52mpg during our time with the car. Safety & security Safety & security The headline safety rating for the Jogger will make for some pretty unpleasant reading. It managed just a single, solitary star (out of five) on the Euro NCAP crash test. Does that mean that it’s an unsafe car? Well… NCAP constantly updates the criteria by which it scores cars, and much of the score recently rests on the fitting of high-end electronic safety aids. Dacia, being a budget brand, doesn’t want to fit those high-end systems as it would push up the price of the car. There’s a push-and-pull element going on here. NCAP wants the pricier systems and is docking manufacturers marks on their safety tests if they’re not fitted. In fact, the Jogger scored a respectable, if not brilliant, 70 per cent for adult occupant protection, and 69 per cent for child occupant protection. It was let down by less than stellar scores in the vulnerable road users and safety assist segments. The Jogger does come, as standard, with six airbags, a seatbelt reminder warning for the front seats, automatic headlights, cruise control and a speed limiter, driver and passenger front airbags, side airbags, and an autonomous emergency braking system. Blind spot warning is added to Expression and Extreme trims. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems Dacia tends to make pretty reliable cars, and indeed it often embarrasses other car makers — even Japanese ones! — with its placing in reliability surveys. It’s worth pointing out, though, that those surveys are often based on customer satisfaction rather than a scientific assessment of actual problems, and when a car is this cheap many buyers might be tempted to give it an easy ride if there have been one or two small issues. Indeed, that’s what we’ve noticed with some Dacias we’ve recently tested, including some electric windows that temporarily stopped working. By and large though, Dacias use older, well-proven Renault components that shouldn’t give too much trouble, and which will be cheap to fix if they do go wrong. In the meantime, Dacia offers a standard three-year, 60,000-mile warranty - but if you keep servicing your car at an approved Dacia retailer, you can extend that out to seven years of cover. That's almost as good as Kia and MG's policies, though it's beaten out by Toyota's ten-year 'Relax' warranty. Dacia Jogger FAQs Dacia Jogger FAQs"
https://www.carwow.co.uk/dacia/bigster,Dacia Bigster Review & Prices,"€32,119",9/10,new,"Is the Dacia Bigster a good car? Is the Dacia Bigster a good car? This is the Dacia Bigster, and it’s fair to say it’s rather exciting. Visits to the Bigster’s Carwow news story in 2024 led to it being crowned Most Anticipated Car of 2025 , and now it’s here - and we’ve driven it. It’s a real case of meeting your heroes. The Bigster is the largest model in the Dacia range, as you might expect from the name. Sitting above the Duster , it’s an alternative to cars such as the Nissan Qashqai , Skoda Karoq , Hyundai Tucson , Ford Kuga and many others. The USP of the Bigster is its price tag. It starts from less than £25,000, and even a range-topping model is less than £30,000. This means that it’s priced similarly to much smaller SUVs , or it gives you a couple of choices - you could have the Dacia for the same price as a two-year-old Hyundai Tucson, or have a top-spec Bigster with all the equipment for the price of an entry-level SUV from another brand. Looking at the Bigster, it’s unmistakably a Dacia - it looks just like the Duster’s bigger sibling, with a similar blocky style. Y-shaped LED daytime running lights mirror the Dacia badge in the centre of the horizontal grille, and round the side there are chunky wheelarches and hidden rear door handles. All models come with alloy wheels and roof bars, reducing the impression that this is a budget SUV. That impression isn’t ruined once you get inside, either. It’s really neatly styled, with more Y-shaped details in things like the air vents. All models get a digital driver’s display along with a 10.1-inch touchscreen infotainment system, which look far more modern than you might expect from a cheap car . You soon see where the money’s been spent - or hasn’t - when you start poking around the interior, though, as it’s uniformly made of hard, cheap plastics. Some areas, such as the strip across the width of the dashboard, have genuinely quite a nasty texture, but they do feel pretty hardwearing. And you can’t argue with the space on offer. The Bigster is one of the larger cars in this class, and so gets a massive boot and space for six-foot adults to stretch out in the rear. There’s a choice of three engines with the Bigster. There are two mild hybrid offerings, one with two-wheel drive and one with four-wheel drive, as well as an all-new full hybrid engine with really impressive fuel economy. We’ve only driven this full hybrid model so far but were left very impressed, though refinement at a cruise can’t match the more premium alternatives available.

You can check out other great Dacia deals , or find a used Dacia for sale . And remember that Carwow can even help you to sell your old car when the time comes. How much is the Dacia Bigster? How much is the Dacia Bigster? Prices for the Dacia Bigster kick off at less than £25,000 for an Expression model with the two-wheel drive mild hybrid engine. Dacia reckons 80% of people will go for a Journey or an Extreme model, though, and these are reasonably priced at well below £27,000 each. Even if you equip the most expensive engine and tick every option box (all three of them) the most you can spend on a Bigster is just over £31,000. That makes it closer to small SUVs such as the VW T-Cross or Ford Puma in terms of price, or comparable to used models of family SUVs like the Hyundai Tucson or Ford Kuga. And you don’t suffer with having a totally barebones car, either. All models have a 10.1-inch infotainment display with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto , alloy wheels, a rear view camera, keyless entry and dual-zone climate control. Step up to Journey and you get a bigger digital driver’s display, built-in sat-nav, an electric tailgate and posher sound system, while Extreme models add a panoramic sunroof. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort Very comfortable and easy to drive - but a bit noisy on the motorway and not much fun in the corners The Bigster has great visibility thanks to big windows all round - there’s even quite a good view over your shoulder, and the rear windscreen is large too. Its square dimensions mean you can judge where the corners of the car are quite easily, and all models get dull parking sensors and a reversing camera to help you judge even better. The full hybrid engine is the only one that comes with an automatic gearbox, and it works very well around town, choosing its power source depending on the battery’s state of charge. We found it would run on electric power most of the time at slow speeds, making for a nice relaxed time. Dacia has given the Bigster quite soft suspension too, and this combined with nice big wheels mean it deals pretty well with lumps and bumps on the road and speed humps around town. There’s something to be said for not having a very sporty setup when it comes to comfort. The full hybrid engine has 155hp, so while it’s not exactly a Ford Mustang it’s not lacking in shove to get the relatively lightweight Bigster up to speed. When you put your foot down though the gearbox does take a few seconds to gird its loins, and it can feel quite clunky as it changes ratios. Once you’re up to the national limit the Bigster remains comfortable and feels stable, with the adaptive cruise control and other driver assistance features working well. You do notice that it’s noisier than other family SUVs, though, mostly in terms of wind noise. A Nissan Qashqai or Skoda Karoq are much more hushed at a cruise. The Dacia Bigster has light steering and doesn’t weigh very much, so it feels relatively nimble on a twisty road. But there’s almost no feedback about what the front wheels are doing and the clunky automatic gearbox does a lot to discourage you from putting your foot down. There is no Sport driving mode like you get on some alternatives, either. The Bigster is very content if you just take it a bit easier - if you’re after an SUV that’s sporty to drive, consider the SEAT Ateca or the smaller Ford Puma. Space and practicality Space and practicality A huge boot and loads of room in the back seats - not all the storage is well thought-out, though Space is one thing the Dacia Bigster isn’t lacking - though you might well have expected that from a car that has ‘Big’ in the name. The front seats aren’t particularly supportive in the corners but they are wide, flat and comfy for long journeys. You even get partial electric adjustment on top-spec models, a first for a Dacia. The steering wheel has plenty of adjustment, as do the mirrors, so drivers of all shapes and sizes should be able to get comfortable. Front-seat occupants get good-sized door bins big enough for a large water bottle, a space to put a mobile phone (wireless charging pad on some models) and a pair of cupholders underneath a rubberised sliding cover. If you don’t want cupholders, you can remove an insert and turn the area into a general catch bin. A bit more room for smaller items would have been useful, though - in particular, there’s nowhere useful to put your car key. The Bigster’s rear seats are pretty cavernous for a car of this price. A six-foot adult can sit behind another with room to spare, and there’s space under the front seats to slide feet. Headroom is great too, even in models fitted with the panoramic sunroof. Centre occupants don’t sit notably higher than the outer two because the seat base is quite flat, and though there is a hump in the floor, it’s not too intrusive. The centre console does extend back quite a way, however. If there’s just two passengers in the back, the centre seat does fold down to become an armrest - but it’s much wider than a normal armrest would be, and feels restrictive. Its hard plastic back isn’t particularly nice to rest your elbow on, either, though it does include cupholders and slots to hold a smartphone. ISOFIX points to mount child seats securely are present in both outer rear seats, and there’s loads of space for a bulky rear-facing chair, with nice wide-opening doors too. The Dacia Bigster has an absolutely massive boot. The two-wheel drive mild hybrid model has up to 677 litres of space, beating just about everything else in the class bar the much larger Skoda Kodiaq’s 910 litres. Opt for the four-wheel drive model and capacity drops to 629 litres, while the full hybrid has 612 litres. That’s still huge when you think that a Nissan Qashqai has just 504 litres of space, a Kia Sportage 591 litres and a Skoda Karoq 521 litres. The rear seats fold easily from the back thanks to handy catches, and they go in a 40:20:40 split rather than the more common 60:40. This means that you can carry longer loads between two rear passengers, for example, and just gives you a lot more flexibility with how you want to maximise your boot space. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories Looks great, but feels its price in places - the Dacia Bigster’s interior does some things really well but could be cleverer in others There are some real highlights when it comes to the Dacia Bigster’s interior. First is that it retains plenty of physical switchgear - there’s a full panel of climate controls underneath the central touchscreen, plus proper buttons on the steering wheel, Dacia’s classic stereo controller attached to the steering column and a little panel on the driver’s side including a shortcut to quickly turn off the more annoying safety features with just a press. This all means you don’t need to faff about with the touchscreen too much when driving. You do get a touchscreen too, of course - it’s a 10.1-inch display running nice simple software. It’s really easy to figure out what you’re after and navigate to it using shortcuts down the side of the screen. It’s a shame that Dacia couldn’t install Google Maps, like sister brand Renault does on its cars, but you do get wireless smartphone connectivity so you can run Google Maps - or another map provider - through Apple Carplay or Android Auto. You even get a digital dial display, which feels quite racy for Dacia. This is a fairly basic 7.0-inch display on Expression models and a posher-looking 10.0-inch display on Journey or Extreme cars. A special mention goes to Dacia’s graphic designer, because the interface used on both screens is simple but supremely cool, and suits Dacia’s outward-bound image perfectly. Another nice addition is the Dacia YouClip system. This is a little square mounting point that you’ll find dotted about the car, and it can be used to clip accessories to. There’s a phone holder, a cupholder, a light, a luggage hook, and more to come - available from Dacia dealers. You could even get busy and 3D print some accessories yourself if you wanted to. While you might not feel the Bigster’s price tag in the design, you’ll soon notice it in the materials used. They’re uniformly hard, scratchy plastic, and a few textures - like the strip that runs across the width of the dashboard - feel as though they were produced very cheaply indeed on a 3D printer. Not the nicest feeling. Everything does seem to be quite hardwearing, though, and an irritating squeak we noticed in our test model turned out only to be the YouClip phone holder, which is soon rectified. MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax There are three quite distinct engines in the Dacia Bigster. The entry-level choice is a 1.2-litre three-cylinder with 140hp, which emits 122g/km of CO2 and claims to return 52.3mpg. There’s also a four-wheel drive version of this engine, which has 130hp, emits 134g/km of CO2 and returns 47.1mpg. Both of these get six-speed manual gearboxes. At the top, there’s the 155hp full hybrid model, which pairs a 1.8-litre petrol engine with a couple of electric motors and a crazily complex automatic transmission. It’s very efficient indeed, emitting just 106g/km of CO2 and claiming more than 60mpg. During our time with it, we saw nearly 55mpg over a mixed test route - very impressive indeed. None of these make for particularly good company car choices, as their CO2 emissions aren’t anywhere near as low as a plug-in hybrid or fully electric alternative, so they suffer with high Benefit-in-Kind tax . First year road tax rates will also be quite pricey, but not ridiculously so. And the Bigster should be efficient on fuel, plus it shouldn’t cost you an arm and a leg to insure either. Safety and security Safety and security The Dacia Bigster was tested by Euro NCAP in 2025, where it scored three stars. The adult occupant score came back as 69%, and the child occupant score is 85%. Dacia famously doesn’t chase NCAP scores, as they often hinge on the assistance tech rather than the crash protection. The Bigster does come with most of the safety equipment you could want, including adaptive cruise control and even necessities like blind spot monitoring. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems Dacia has a mixed record with reliability - in the 2024 Driver Power owner satisfaction survey , the brand came a disappointing 22nd out of 32 ranked. However, individually the Duster was rated the most satisfying car to own in the UK - so hopefully the Bigster follows in its footsteps. Dacia Duster FAQs Dacia Duster FAQs"
https://www.carwow.co.uk/dacia/logan-mcv,Dacia Logan MCV Review and Prices,"€12,212",6/10,new,"The Dacia Logan MCV is a cheap small estate car that has a huge boot and can be bought with an impressively frugal diesel engine. It’s not the most comfortable family car on sale but it’s hard to argue with its bargain-basement price tag and practical interior. It’s not a particularly exciting car to look at, inside or out. Swathes of brittle black and grey plastics smother the Logan’s cabin, and although it’s as boring to look at as a braille picture book, its hard materials feel like they’ll withstand even the roughest treatment from kids. You’ll be better off avoiding entry-level Access models – they don’t even come with a stereo. Mid-range Ambiance models have a few more creature comforts but top-spec Laureate versions are the ones to go for. They sport a few softer trims in the cabin, come with a much more up-to-date seven-inch touchscreen infotainment system with satellite navigation and voice recognition as standard, and have air-conditioning. Getting comfortable is a little tricky if you’re anything but average height – only range-topping versions come with height adjustable seats and an adjustable steering wheel. You can’t get the Logan MCV with lumbar support to reduce backache on long drives either, but there’s loads of headroom in the front and space in the back is reasonably generous, too. Three adults will just about fit and there’s plenty of space for kids to get comfortable. The Logan MCV’s huge boot is what sets it apart from other cars in its price range – no other car that costs this little can carry as much stuff as the Logan MCV can in its practical, square load bay. It’s very nearly as roomy as the capacious Skoda Octavia but costs around £10,000 less. The Dacia can carry 573 litres of luggage with the rear seats in place – enough space for multiple suitcases. Fold the back seats down in a handy two-way (60:40) split and it grows to a massive 1,518 litres – easily big enough to carry a bike without removing its wheels. Buying a Dacia Logan MCV is like getting an Ikea wardrobe – it’s boxy, affordable and immensely practical but you can’t shake the feeling that it’s probably cheap for a reason… You can get the Logan with a choice of three petrol engines and one diesel. Pick the 0.9-litre turbo petrol if you spend most time pootling around town – it’s reasonably perky and will return around 45mpg. The 1.5-litre diesel is a better bet if you’re often on the motorway or regularly carry heavy loads. It has more pulling power than the petrol but will still return around 65mpg. On rough roads you’ll feel larger bumps through the Logan’s seats and it’s rather noisy at motorway speeds – so it’s not a relaxing car for long trips. Thankfully, its big windows make it pretty easy to park or thread through tight city streets. Euro NCAP awarded the Logan MCV a three-star safety rating in 2014. It won’t offer quite as much protection in a crash as some more modern cars but all MCV’s come with a selection of electronic systems that help you stay in control in slippery conditions. That said, the Logan MCV’s so cheap you can easily forgive the fact that it’s not all that well built and isn’t particularly relaxing to drive. It’s one of the few roomy cars you can buy for the money and well worth considering if you prefer practicality to a premium feel."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/dacia/spring,Dacia Spring Review & Prices,"€18,714",Not found,new,"Is the Dacia Spring a good car? Is the Dacia Spring a good car? Electric cars are really expensive, right? Well, Dacia doesn’t think so. The new Dacia Spring EV will cost less than £15,000 when it goes on sale later in 2024, making it the cheapest new electric car on sale by quite a margin. It’s one of the cheapest cars, full stop - even petrol-powered city cars such as the Toyota Aygo X cost more to buy. But does being the Poundland of EVs mean that you’ll end up with a car that’s actually no use to anyone? The Dacia Spring is sort of a halfway house between electric cars that aren’t really cars - like the Citroen Ami - and the cheapest versions of proper EVs, such as the Vauxhall Corsa Electric . Its closest alternative is the new Citroen e-C3 , which is the second-cheapest EV on sale (if you’re keeping track) but promises to be a more rounded product. The Spring EV is a tiny car, weighing less than a ton and around 30cm shorter than Dacia’s other small car, the Sandero. That means you only get four seats inside, though they’re surprisingly spacious for such a dinky car. You also get a 308-litre boot, which is bigger than a Vauxhall Corsa Electric’s 267 litres and almost the same size as a Citroen e-C3’s 310-litre space. Dacia Spring: electric range, battery and charging data Range: 140 miles Efficiency: 5.1mi/kWh Battery size: 27kWh Max charge speed: 30kW Charge time AC: 3hrs 50 mins, 7kW Charge time DC: 45 mins, 20-80% Charge port location: Front centre Power outputs: 45hp/65hp You can even tick the right options box to unlock 35 litres of ‘frunk’ space under the bonnet, making a useful spot to store charging cables and other supplies. The interior of the Spring is very much aiming for ‘cheap and cheerful’, with flashes of colour lifting the ambience and hopefully distracting you from the cheap materials. All models do get a 7.0-inch digital drivers display, and equipment for UK models is going to be surprisingly generous - with cruise control, air-con and remote locking as standard. Top-spec cars will also get a 10.0-inch infotainment screen with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Where you’ll really notice the cost-cutting is on the road. Dacia will offer two versions of the Spring in the UK, named the 45 and the 65. The former has a 45hp electric motor, a top speed of just 78mph and takes a yawning 19.1 seconds to get from 0-62mph. The 65 model has - you guessed it - 65hp, and manages 0-62mph in a much more palatable 13.7 seconds, which is on par with most petrol city cars. Being so light, the Spring makes the most out of its tiny 27kWh battery pack, with an official range of 137 miles per charge. That’s a modest amount, especially when you look at larger EVs that can do almost 300 miles - but it’s more than enough for even a fairly chunky daily commute, and for many people it’ll be plenty. Especially if the Spring is playing as a second car for a family that already has a combustion-engined vehicle for longer journeys. We’ll be getting behind the wheel of the Dacia Spring before it goes on sale to bring you our full verdict of what it’s like to drive and live with. In the meantime, though, you can check out what we think are the best cheap electric cars , or see how much you could save on a Dacia Spring or other Dacia models here. You can also take a look at used Dacias , or trust our network of dealers to help you sell your old car when the time comes. How much does the Dacia Spring cost? How much does the Dacia Spring cost? Pricing is the real headline, coming in at less than £15,000. For that you get the Expression trim with air-conditioning, rear parking sensors, remote central locking and the required suite of safety equipment. Stepping up to Extreme adds a proper infotainment system, a rear camera, and more stylish body and interior trim. The Spring 45 is available only as Expression trim, and you’ll pay an extra £1,000 for the 65. Another £1,000 on top of that gets you the 65 in Extreme trim. This is incredibly cheap - the Spring doesn’t just undercut existing electric cars, it’s cheaper than most petrol hatchbacks of a similar size. The closest EV alternative is the new Citroen e-C3, which comes in at just under £22,000 - though that’s a larger car, with a longer range and greater performance."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/dacia/sandero-stepway,Dacia Sandero Stepway Review & Prices,"€21,019",8/10,new,"Is the Dacia Sandero Stepway a good car? Is the Dacia Sandero Stepway a good car? The Dacia Sandero Stepway is the jacked-up, slightly buffer cousin to the regular Dacia Sandero supermini. Stepway, in Dacia parlance, means a car has had a slight SUV makeover - it gets higher suspension, plastic cladding around the bumpers and wheelarches, and some outward-bound features such as roof bars. In the case of the Sandero Stepway, however, it doesn’t come with any real mechanical changes - despite appearances, there’s no four-wheel drive or off-road kit to get excited about. Think of the Stepway like a regular Sandero that’s done some situps - it looks beefier and more capable, even if it’s not really any more powerful. Superminis with faux-SUV makeovers had a spate of popularity a few years ago, but nowadays the Sandero Stepway is out on a bit of a limb. You might prefer to stake your claim on either side of the Sandero Stepway, and opt for either a normal supermini - such as the Renault Clio , the SEAT Ibiza or even the normal Dacia Sandero. Or, you could go the whole hog and opt for a proper small SUV - such as the Volkswagen T-Cross or Skoda Kamiq . Dacia remains a value brand at heart, and so even though the Sandero Stepway is the most expensive way to buy a new Sandero it remains one of the cheapest new cars in the UK. Despite this, it feels well built inside, and even though there’s an abundance of hard plastics there’s also a few concessions to style and comfort - such as a fabric strip across the dashboard to add some visual interest. It’s dead easy to find a comfy seating position, and all the controls are as straightforward and self-explanatory as you’ll find anywhere. If you’re upgrading to the Sandero Stepway from an older car, you won’t find anywhere near as steep a learning curve as you would in some of the competition’s touchscreen-heavy interiors. The Sandero Stepway drives a lot like an older car too, with heavier controls than many modern superminis. That does extend to the equipment list - while you’ll find all the essentials such as air-con, remote central locking and smartphone connectivity, Dacia hasn’t gone to great lengths to fit the latest safety equipment. While this may suit you if you don’t like the incessant beeping and interfering you get from some models, it contributes to one of the Sandero Stepway’s biggest downsides - a dire two-star Euro NCAP safety rating . Read into this further and it’s not quite so shocking, though. The Sandero scored the equivalent of four stars for occupant protection in a crash, but a car’s overall Euro NCAP star rating is dictated by its lowest category, where the absence of things like lane-keeping assist and pedestrian detection for the autonomous emergency braking pulled the result down. You’ll be able to make your own judgement, of course. But what this means is that while the Dacia Sandero Stepway isn’t fundamentally unsafe in a crash, there are safer small cars out there - ones that not only protect their occupants better but have technology to help avoid incident in the first place. If you’re interested, you can find the latest Dacia Sandero Stepway deals right here on Carwow. You could also look at the deals on a used Dacia Sandero Stepway here, as well as other used Dacias . And when the time comes to change your car, you can sell your car online through Carwow’s network of trusted dealers too. How much is the Dacia Sandero Stepway? How much is the Dacia Sandero Stepway? Cars in roughly the same price bracket as the Stepway include the Fiat 500 , Kia Picanto and Hyundai i10 , although the Dacia offers plenty more practicality and space. There are three trim grades , starting with Essential, before moving on to Expression and range-topping Extreme. The base model comes with 16-inch steel wheels (though with wheel covers that do a remarkable job of pretending to be alloys), electric front windows, Bluetooth and DAB but no infotainment touchscreen - instead, you get a phone mount in the centre of the dashboard. The Expression trim is £1,000 extra but adds an 8.0-inch touchscreen with smartphone connectivity, rear parking sensors, keyless entry and automatic lights and wipers. Extreme is a further £1,400 but brings an electric parking brake, black alloy wheels, a rear-view camera, blind spot monitoring and 'Extended Grip' - not a four-wheel drive system, but one that shuffles power between the front wheels for a little extra traction in slippery conditions. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort The Dacia is decent in town, but longer journeys on the motorway will be a bit of a challenge – to drivers as well as to the engine The engine and car combination works really well for a vehicle that will be spending much of its time in town, which is what you’d expect from the Stepway. Paired to a slightly notchy manual gearbox, the Sandero Stepway responds well around town. The raised suspension and soft springs seem like they were designed for the unmade roads in Dacia's native Romania, but that means they make short work of the speed bumps and potholes of the British road network. The steering isn’t the sharpest, but more than suitable for town, where drivers will be operating at relatively lower speeds. The turning circle is on a par with similar cars, which helps when navigating tight turns or spaces as well as mini roundabouts. Unsurprisingly, the Stepway isn’t the strongest contender for long-distance journeys. The engine noise is noticeable, while there is also wind and tyre noise present. Part of that is down to the fact that cost-savings have been made when it comes to sound deadening in the cabin, but also a 1.0-litre engine is always going to make itself heard when pushed to the limit at higher speeds. Swift overtaking manoeuvres aren’t made easy due to the engine’s lack of power, plus any inclines could prove a bit of a challenge to the small motor. However, compare this to cars in the Sandero Stepway's price bracket - city cars such as the Toyota Aygo X or Kia Picanto - and the Dacia seems positively sprightly. The manual gearbox might sound appealing to those who want to contend with B roads, but the changes aren’t the smoothest and it can be a bit of an effort to keep the speed in the desired range. While it’s not the most fun car of its kind– something like a SEAT Ibiza is more entertaining on the twisty stuff – the Dacia’s dynamics aren’t the worst either. The steering has enough feel in it to give a bit of confidence when cornering and there’s decent grip in the tyres. The ride quality also helps at higher speeds, because – like in the urban environment – any bumps in the road are dealt with easily. Practicality and boot space Practicality and boot space The interior is surprisingly spacious but you might want more storage solutions around the cabin It shouldn’t be an issue for drivers or front passengers to get comfortable in the front of the Stepway as there is a really good amount of movement forwards and backwards as well as up and down. It’s all done manually – you can’t expect too much in a sub-£18,000 car – but the movement is slick and the levers are easy to access. It’s the same when it comes to the steering wheel, with movement in all directions. The exception to this is the Essential model, which only offers changes up and down. But it shouldn’t be a deal-breaker in the grand scheme of things. There’s enough storage inside the cabin, without Dacia going overboard. Some grades of the car don’t have a central armrest, which robs people of a bit of space to put phone, keys, sweets, or whatever else they might like. There is a relatively shallow area in front of the gear lever and it’s not got any anti-slip measures, which means anything in there will roll around on the hard plastic. The glovebox is a decent enough size, there are a couple of cupholders and storage bins in the doors. Overall it’s a decent layout with a surprising amount of comfort, which is always a bonus. There is plenty of head and leg room for rear passengers – certainly more than the likes of the Fiat 500 and Hyundai i10. The middle seat is pretty good, even taller travellers shouldn’t have their legs impeded too much by the transmission tunnel running down the centre of the car because it’s relatively small. There are ISOFIX points for child seats and, such is the amount of room in the rear, it is easy to install all types of seat, including the rear-facing baby seats that can be a bit of a struggle in other small cars. In terms of practicality, there aren’t any USB ports or anything like that, but the front seat backs do offer pockets for books, magazines, tablets or – if you’re really old school – maps. Moving to the rear of the car, and that practicality of the Sandeo Stepway stands proud with the boot offering 328 litres of space, more than many other vehicles in this price bracket. The Kia Picanto has 252 litres of space, the Fiat 500 just 185 litres. There are split-folding rear seats in every Stepway apart from the base model, while a movable boot floor that can create more space or level off the boot lip, depending on how the boot is being used. As you might expect, it’s pretty basic here, with no connectivity ports or other storage solutions such as nets or hooks. However, the space alone will be enough for many buyers to be impressed. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories Simplicity is key to the Stepway’s interior, which also has a few quality touches on higher grade models. But many people might be looking further down the range might want a bit more more from their cabin, regardless of the low list price For a car that is, let’s face it, cheap based on the current range of car prices, the Dacia Sandero Stepway has a decent interior with the ability to spec some nice chrome touches breaking up the swathes of plastic around the cabin. These include on the heating dials – none of that annoying touchscreen operation to keep you warm or cool you down – and also on the doors. Some of those do come at a cost, however, with entry level models looking a bit bland. There’s a modest infotainment screen that is available on all but the entry level Stepway. Again, it’s relatively basic, as you might expect, but that will almost be a blessing for some people who might not be used to the more complicated modern sort of setup. Or, for those people who want straightforward functions from their car and to have fewer buttons to press or steps to go through to complete a task. For example, there are six options: radio; media; phone; vehicle; nav and smartphone integration. Hit any of those options and you get to where you need to be – it’s really that easy. It’s responsive too, which is something that will be welcomed by many put off by more complex systems in more expensive cars. There are audio controls on a stalk behind the steering wheel, as you might expect to see in Renaults. There is also additional functionality on the steering wheel, which boasts a lot of buttons that control both the central screen as well as the driver display. The latter item again keeps it simple, with two analogue dials for speed and revs and a digital screen that shows data such as tyre pressures, economy and radio channel. MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax It might seem like an obvious thing to say, but drivers who buy a Sandero Stepway aren’t too interested in performance. There are two engine choices - the most popular is a 1.0-litre petrol with 90hp. However, on the top model there is the option of a manual or automatic (CVT) gearbox (the lower two models are manual only). The zero to 60mph ‘sprint’ can be completed in 12 seconds flat when behind the wheel of the manual Stepway, while the same test in the automatic takes 14.2 seconds. The auto also uses more fuel – the manual Stepway records an official economy figure of 50mpg, while in the auto, drivers will be looking at a best of 46mpg. Meanwhile CO2 emissions for the two models have been figured at 127g/km (manual) and 140g/km (auto). Road tax cost for the first year isn't too ruinous thanks to this, nor are company car tax bills. The really thrifty might be interested in the Sandero Bi-Fuel. This is a unique offering to Dacia at the moment, and it's a 100hp version of the 1.0-litre engine that can run on either petrol or liquified petroleum gas (LPG). LPG is typically around half the price of petrol, so it could prove extremely cost-effective - but filling stations are comparatively rare so you might have to go further out of your way to find one. The Bi-Fuel Sandero is actually the same price as the regular petrol so there's no real reason not to choose it - unless you need an automatic. Safety and security Safety and security The previous Sandero Stepway received a four-star rating from Euro NCAP , but the newer model – due to changes in the testing standards – only managed two stars. Adult occupant and child occupant safety were scored at 70% and 72% respectively, while other categories are where the Dacia really suffered. Protection for vulnerable road users was rated at just 41%, while safety assist technology rated not much better at 42%. While the car is fitted with an acceptable amount of front and side airbags (no central ones though) and pretensioners, the other safety systems are found lacking. There’s no autonomous emergency braking technology apart from car-to-car, not any lane keeping assist know-how onboard. Security-wise, all versions of the Sandero Stepway have an immobiliser and automatic and remote central locking. And apart from the base Essential grade, there’s keyless entry technology fitted. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems Sandero Stepway buyers get the industry standard three-year/60,000-mile warranty when purchasing a new car, but this can be extended out to seven years or 75,000 miles provided the car is serviced with a Dacia approved retailer each year. Despite the disappointing Euro NCAP score, the reliability of the Dacia brand has been recognised in different industry surveys, in one example placing second out of thirty car manufacturers. There have been recalls related to Dacia’s standard Sandero model – specifically a possible high pressure fuel system fault and an issue with the bonnet – but nothing that relates to the Stepway."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/fiat/tipo,Fiat Tipo Review & Prices,"€5,604",4/10,used,"Is the Fiat Tipo a good car? Is the Fiat Tipo a good car? The Fiat Tipo is available with a choice of two petrol and two diesel engines in five different power outputs. The entry-level 1.3-litre diesel model comes with a five-speed manual gearbox while larger engines benefit from a six-speed manual. A six-speed automatic gearbox is offered on 1.6-litre petrol and diesel cars and Fiat has announced a dual-clutch version will be available in the near future. Its interior is a departure from the retro-inspired Fiat 500 range and focuses instead on basic functionality and occupant comfort. The rear seats have an impressive amount of legroom and the tall rear roofline provides decent headroom. As a result, three six-foot tall passengers can sit in the back for shorter journeys. Standard equipment on entry-level cars might disappoint some customers although a seven-inch touchscreen infotainment system with Apple CarPlay , Android Auto and sat nav is available on higher-spec models. The 440-litre boot is more spacious than those in the Nissan Pulsar (350 litres) and Renault Megane (384 litres) but lags behind the Skoda Octavia's capacious 600-litre load bay. The rear seat bases can be flipped forward allowing the seat backs to be folded completely flat and the lack of discernible load lip makes loading heavy or bulky items easy, too. The Fiat Tipo does a good job of blending cheap running costs with impressive practicality and a reasonably refined ride in a distinctive and sharply-styled package. The selection of engines on offer might be sparing, but two efficient diesels and a number of rev-happy petrols should mean there’s a Tipo to suit the needs of most potential customers.

How much is the Fiat Tipo? How much is the Fiat Tipo? Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort With its bland driving experience, the Fiat Tipo is about average in a class that has some highly accomplished rivals such as the comfortable Renault Megane and sporty Vauxhall Astra The Fiat Tipo is available with four different engines in five power outputs. Two diesels come in 1.3 and 1.6-litre capacities while petrol-powered models come with either a 1.4 or 1.6-litre engine. Although the diesels cater for the more cost-conscious buyer thanks to better fuel economy, the petrol units are both more refined and make the car far more involving to drive. The 1.3-litre diesel engine produces 95hp, just enough to accelerate the five-door Fiat Tipo from rest to 62mph in a sluggish 12 seconds. This engine has to work hard at all times and is less refined as a result – not only is it loud around town but it drones at motorway speeds. These problems are compounded by the five-speed gearbox that feels loose and old-fashioned. This engine is, however, fairly economical and can return a claimed 76mpg – CO2 emissions of 99g/km are also fairly impressive. The 1.6-litre diesel is noticeably more refined than the entry-level 1.3. Not only is it quieter but it feels less agricultural thanks, in part, to a slicker six-speed manual gearbox. Performance is improved thanks to a 120hp power output and 1.6-litre diesel models can sprint to 62mph from rest in 10.1 seconds. Fuel economy and CO2 emissions are almost identical to the smaller 1.3-litre diesel (76mpg and 98g/km respectively) but the significantly more refined 1.6-litre unit is the one we’d recommend. The 1.4-litre petrol engine in both 95hp and turbocharged 120hp forms is more fun to drive and quieter, but it loses out in terms of fuel economy and CO2 emissions. The 95hp model is capable of returning 50mpg and emitting 132g/km of CO2. The 120hp model costs the same and can return a comparable 47mpg. This engine allows the Tipo to sprint to 62mph from rest in 9.6 seconds – 2.5 seconds faster than a cheaper 95hp car. The 1.6-litre non-turbo model with 110hp caters for drivers looking for a petrol-powered car with an automatic gearbox. This engine, however, is not only less powerful than the 1.4-litre model but with CO2 emissions of 147g/km. Fuel economy also takes a hit – cars fitted with this engine can only manage a claimed 45mpg. Fiat has focused on reducing the effect of external noise, vibration and ride harshness throughout the Fiat Tipo ’s development – the result is a car that can cruise comfortably on motorways with minimal disturbance from rough roads or unruly wind noise. It might not be as fun to drive as a Ford Focus nor as refined as a Vauxhall Astra but, for a significantly cheaper family hatchback the Tipo has decent levels of grip and corners without lots of body roll. The power steering feels over-assisted and numb, however, and little feedback is transmitted through the steering wheel. The ride is reasonably comfortable but harsh bumps can often be jarring and the stiff suspension results in a car that always feels slightly unsettled. This is especially obvious on pitted or poorly maintained roads. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories Customers expecting a funky, retro-styled interior might be disappointed by the Fiat Tipo’s cabin The infotainment screen and instrument binnacle float on a sea of boring black plastic and although the doors are trimmed in an Alcantara-type fabric there’s a wealth of scratchy parts that make the Fiat Tipo feel cheaper than some rivals. Rivals such as the Hyundai i30 have better materials and superior build quality. Basic Fiat Tipo models get an old-school radio and no infotainment screen. You have to go mid-range in order to get a five-inch touchscreen that isn’t that good anyway. It is better that what Honda can offer you but falls way short of the operational speed, easy menu structure and colorful graphics of a VW Group system that you’d find in a Skoda Octavia."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/fiat/500x-dolcevita-hatchback,Fiat 500X Dolcevita Hatchback Review & Prices,"€38,440",5/10,new,"Is the Fiat 500X Dolcevita a good car? Is the Fiat 500X Dolcevita a good car? In Italian, ‘dolce vita’ means to live the good life. In the case of the Fiat 500X Dolcevita, though, it means your retro-inspired SUV has a retractable roof. In the world of word association it’s quite the leap, but what’s in a name, really? You could compare the Fiat 500X Dolcevita to sipping espresso on the sun terrace of a cafe, because it’s cool, Italian and if the weather’s nice, more enjoyable if you can be exposed to the sunny sky. Convertible SUVs are a rare breed, with the much derided Range Rover Evoque Convertible and, more recently, the Volkswagen T-Roc Cabriolet scarce examples. But unlike these, the 500X Dolcevita has a retractable canvas roof that’s more like a big sunroof than a proper drop-top. While that sounds like a diss, the upside is that you don’t get the awkward proportions of the cars mentioned above. Instead, the design of the regular 500X remains as an alternative to regular family SUVs such as the Mini Countryman , Skoda Kamiq and Peugeot 2008 . The 500X is almost a decade old now, and its styling is heavily inspired by the small Fiat 500 city car that first reappeared in 2007. Yet it somehow still looks fresh and fun. While early versions of the 500X struggled to wrap the design cues over the bigger, chunkier body, Fiat has largely figured the details out to make this a pretty good looking SUV. You’ll find a similar funky chic style inside. It’s a playful appearance that offers something very different to some of the duller alternatives, such as the Kamiq or SEAT Arona , though it doesn’t feel quite as well built as those. The 7.0-inch touchscreen is one of the smaller units you’ll find in a family SUV, while it’s not hard to find some cheaper plastics. When we’ve tested the regular 500X we’ve found interior space to be similar to family hatchbacks such as the Volkswagen Golf . Tall passengers should be pretty comfortable whether they’re sitting in the front or the back, though a third person in the middle would be a bit of a squeeze. Boot space measures in at 350 litres, and because this isn’t a proper convertible that needs somewhere to store its folded roof, there’s no reduction in that space if you want an open air drive. It’s a useful space that’s big enough for a couple of suitcases, but lags behind the Kamiq (400 litres), 2008 (434 litres) and Countryman (450 litres). There’s just one engine choice in the 500X Dolcevita. It’s a 1.5-litre petrol making 130hp, and although Fiat calls it a ‘Hybrid’ that’s overstating it a little bit. It’s effectively a mild-hybrid, which means it has a small electric motor that can take some of the load off the engine and run for very short periods on electric. It has some minor economy and emissions improvements, but you won’t be running to the shops and back without engaging the petrol engine. Official economy figures suggest you should see up to 49mpg with CO2 emissions up to 136g/km. In our experience with the regular 500X, we’ve found it to be a good option for those who want an SUV with some character, but there are plenty of alternatives that are better put together and more practical, too. The retractable roof of the Dolcevita is a cool USP, though. Interested? You can check out the latest Fiat 500X Dolcevita deals on carwow, or browse the latest used Fiats , too.

https://www.carwow.co.uk/fiat/500c,Fiat 500C Review & Prices,"€5,259",6/10,used,"Is the Fiat 500C a good car? Is the Fiat 500C a good car? Inspired by ‘La Dolce Vita’ of warm days in Tuscany or Rome, the Fiat 500C is a convertible small car that has a sliding soft-top and wonderfully retro styling. With only the Mini Convertible and Toyota Aygo X (when it's fitted with a sliding roof) the only true alternatives, the 500C is part of a rare breed – but it’s not going the way of the dodo just yet, with the 500 Electric Convertible taking up the zero-emission mantle. Its style is classic Fiat, with plenty of chrome trim around the main badge and lights matching the throwback looks. The short overhangs, which make it great in town, are matched with more chrome around the back, which has rectangular lights and shows the full extent of the sliding roof. Inside, most of the dashboard features a body-coloured panel to match the outside. That hosts the 7.0-inch touchscreen, the climate controls and a high-mounted gear lever. The steering wheel sits in front of the speedometer, which has the rev counter inside it as well as a small driver information display, which isn’t easy to navigate. Top versions get a 7.0-inch screen behind the wheel, although that isn’t the simplest to use either. You won’t find a lot of cabin space in the 500C. Yes, the driver can get comfortable fairly easily, but if you’re tall you won’t find masses of headroom available. Trying to squeeze adults into the back is very tricky, as you have to fold the front seat forward, then clamber into a space where you’ll find little room. The boot isn’t particularly large either. At 185 litres, it seriously lags behind the boot in the Mini Convertible and Toyota Aygo X, while multiple other small cars top that if you’re not desperate for the sliding roof. Folding the back seats down does open more space, but the boot opening itself is too narrow to fit larger items in. You only get one engine choice with the 500C – a 70hp 1.0-litre three-cylinder petrol engine with a small generator and battery applied to help with fuel economy. That comes with a six-speed manual transmission. The sprint from 0-60mph is more of a jog, taking 13.8 seconds. In town, the keenly revving engine helps you get up to urban speeds quickly enough, while the light steering can be made even lighter by pressing a button on the centre console to make the Fiat more manoeuvrable. The 500C is comfortable enough over bumps and you get a good view around you, but the rear view can be hindered with the roof rolled down. That tiny engine does start to run out of puff when you’re on the motorway though. As it takes so long to get up to speed, you have to make the most out of every gear by revving it close to the red line. It is also quite noisy at higher speeds, with wind and road noise glaringly obvious. If you’re in an Abarth 695C – a tricked-out Fiat 500 – twisty roads are a lot of fun. Not so much in the Fiat 500C. You feel like you might topple over if you take a corner too quickly, and the steering does not give you a great sense of how much grip your front tyres have. While the Fiat 500C offers a lot for those wanting to enjoy sunnier weather when driving around town, there are sacrifices that need to be made –. it’s not that practical for its size and isn’t refined when you need to go on a longer journey, with a Mini Convertible or Toyota Aygo X being more accomplished overall. If you want to see the best new deals on a Fiat 500C , check out carwow, where you can find used FIat 500C offers as well. You can look into other used Fiats here, and if you want to change your car the easy way, you can sell your car through carwow where our trusted dealers will get you the best price. How much is the Fiat 500C? How much is the Fiat 500C? The Fiat 500C is not the cheapest small car around, with the Toyota Aygo X uncutting it by a lot. There’s also the Hyundai i10 and Kia Picanto you could choose, although neither come with the option of a sliding roof. It’s one of the smallest hybrids available, with the larger Suzuki Swift and Toyota Yaris being the closest alternatives in that respect. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort While it’s a whizz around town, the 500C isn’t adept on faster roads Because of its short overhangs, the Fiat 500C is perfect for driving in town, because it’s so easy to place on tight streets. The light steering also makes it feel like a go-kart and if you press the button with the steering wheel icon above it, it makes it feel much lighter to make manoeuvring much easier. The suspension feels settled over bumps by soaking up most smaller lumps. Only larger holes and cracks slightly unsettle it. You only have the option of the 1.0-litre engine with the six-speed manual, and this combo works best when you rev highly and hold the gear a little longer than you normally would. It gets you up to speed quickly enough, while coasting with the hybrid setup helps you reduce fuel usage. At urban speeds, you can fold the roof down as well. If it’s a nice day, it only takes a few seconds for the cloth roof to peel back and allow all the light in. Being on the cheaper end of the scale, the Fiat 500C doesn’t have the best sound insulation. When you replace a solid roof panel with a cloth roof, that’s made even worse. You’ll notice a lot of wind and road noise at motorway speeds, making conversations difficult. You also have to work the car quite hard to get up to speed. With a 0-60mph time of 13.8 seconds, you need to change gear at the top of the rev range to make that easier and when you’re sitting at 70mph, you can hear the engine a lot. You’ll also notice that bumps are more noticeable at speed. With the suspension set up for more comfort in town, you’ll feel more bumps and shudders through the body. If you want to take the roof down, you might not find it as enjoyable as you’re expecting. There’s a lot of turbulence at higher speeds, which makes the experience uncomfortable. Abarth takes a Fiat 500 and makes it feel like a B-road demon. But Fiat hasn’t taken the same direction with the 500, going more for a comfort angle. It rides fairly high and it does lean quite a bit when you’re driving at a higher rate around a corner. While the light steering works well in town, it doesn’t inspire confidence when you’re driving quickly. You don’t get a great sense of grip from the front tyres and you’re much better off taking it easy. The engine also doesn’t offer the most fun driving experience as it runs out of puff quickly and when the hybrid system kicks in to recoup energy, it slows you down a bit when you lift your foot off the accelerator. Space and practicality Space and practicality While average-sized drivers will be pretty comfortable, taller people could feel claustrophobic, while storage is also poor Being quite a small vehicle, the Fiat 500C isn’t going to be great at lugging things around on a regular basis. There are two cupholders under the high-mounted gear lever and one behind the front row, so you can put your coffee down safely. There isn’t much else room though, with limited door bin space and a modest glovebox. You don’t have a slot for your phone if you plug it in though, so you’ll need to use a cupholder for it. While you can get comfortable in the driver’s seat with vertical and horizontal adjustment, you can’t move the steering column closer or further away. Taller drivers will also feel that the roof is a bit close. With no rear door, it’s not very easy to get into the second row, and you only get two seats in there to ferry people around. You get two ISOFIX points so you can mount child seats, but getting a bulky one in there will be tricky. If you’ve got two adults up front, rear legroom will not be good at all, while the curved roofline will limit headroom for taller people as well. If you’re taking people around in summer, taking the roof off will help with that though. The 500C’s boot is not what you’d call useful for most. The 185-litre space has a small opening below the level of the roof mechanism and it can be very tricky to put things in there. The Toyota Aygo X has a 225-litre boot, while the Mini Convertible has 215 litres (although that drops to 160 litres with the roof stowed away). Folding the rear seats down opens up the space to 520 litres – the same as an Audi A6’s standard boot with the seats up. There is a lump between the seat backs and the boot floor but folding the roof back makes it a lot easier to load things into the back, which could be useful for some. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories The interior does have a pop of colour and funky style hints, but the quality of most of the materials isn’t great The retro styling of the exterior continues into the cabin, as you get a nice body-coloured metal panel across the dashboard. It adds a splash of colour in what can otherwise be quite a dark interior when the roof’s closed. For the entry-level 500C, you get climate controls reminiscent of a car from the 90s because of the plastic adjustment dials, while the Top model gets air conditioning buttons with small displays showing the temperature and fan speed. It’s quite rudimentary but it works well. Being on the cheaper end of the scale, the 500C’s cabin doesn’t have the best feeling materials. The doors have a scratchy plastic trim on them, while there’s lots of other lower quality plastics elsewhere too. You do get a leather steering wheel cover, but the buttons and stalks behind it don’t feel great. The infotainment is on a 7.0-inch touchscreen, and while it’s pretty good for a car of this size, it can be unresponsive and the menus are limited. You’re better off using Apple CarPlay or Android Auto , although they don’t utilise the full screen as there’s a menu bar across the bottom. Behind the steering wheel on the Top model, you get a 7.0-inch display for your driver information. While there are different views for it and it’s fairly clear, it’s not the easiest to use. As standard there’s a smaller trip computer that’s not the simplest either. You can choose from different interior and roof finishes depending on the body colour, and some of the lighter trim options can’t be paired with brighter body colour selections. There’s limited optional extras besides. MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax You only get one engine choice – a 70hp 1.0-litre three-cylinder petrol engine with a mild-hybrid setup. That allows for marginally better fuel economy over an engine without it, but it doesn’t make much of a performance difference. With the six-speed manual transmission, you can get fuel economy up to 60.1mpg and emissions of 108g/km CO2 – with the latter meaning you’ll be paying a lower level of road tax . On our tests, the 500C got 49.7mpg across multiple conditions, which isn’t terrible. When it comes to company car tax , the 500C will be at a lower level too, as it’s more affordable and lower-emitting than most cars. Safety and security Safety and security With a three-star safety rating from Euro NCAP when it was tested in 2017, the 500C isn’t the safest option around. It was average across most departments, but did particularly poorly with safety assists. Safety systems are few and far between, with only rear parking sensors fitted on the Top trim. You do get cruise control, but there’s no emergency braking system or lane keep assist to help you – that makes the 500C feel quite dated. There’s rear ISOFIX points to fit a child seat, as well as seven airbags, remote central locking and electronic stability control. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems While it’s not the most complex car, the Fiat 500 has had some recalls. Most recently, a nut hasn’t been tightened enough in the steering column of some models, while the positive lead for the auxiliary battery might not be tightened properly. As standard, you get a three-year/60,000-mile warranty, which doesn’t match up to the Toyota Aygo X’s 10-year/100,000-mile guarantee."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/fiat/panda-4x4,Fiat Panda 4x4 Review and Prices,"€20,894",7/10,new,"The Fiat Panda 4×4 is a compact city car that’ll take the odd off-road excursion in its stride. It’s just as easy to live with as the standard Panda but comes with a grippy four-wheel-drive system that makes it a worthy alternative to the likes of the Suzuki Jimny and Dacia Duster 4×4. Inside, however, the Fiat Panda 4×4 comes with a much more stylish cabin than the unapologetically basic Suzuki. The dials, heating controls and even the centre of the steering wheel come with a squared-off circular design (should that be squircular?) and you can choose from a selection of camouflage olive, beige and brown trims for the dashboard. Less worthy of praise, however, is the Fiat Panda 4×4’s infotainment system. Rather than a slick touchscreen like you get as standard in many other small SUVs (including the Suzuki Jimny) you’ll have to make do with a back-to-basics stereo and CD player with an old-fashioned orange and black display. Fiat’s UConnect app lets you use some of your smartphone’s features while you’re driving, but it’s nowhere near as intuitive as the more commonplace Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone mirroring systems you’ll find in many alternatives. So, the Fiat Panda 4×4 doesn’t have a particularly high-tech cabin, but at least it’s relatively spacious for such a small car. Its tall body means there’s enough headroom in both the front and rear seats for adults to get comfy, but those in the back will be left wishing there was slightly more leg room – especially on long journeys. It’s a similar story when you take a look at the Fiat Panda 4×4’s boot. Its 225-litre capacity is big enough for a weekly shop but significantly smaller than the space you get in the likes of the less off-road focussed SEAT Arona and Renault Captur. Unlike most so-called off-roaders, the Fiat Panda 4x4 is perfectly capable of hauling you and three friends over deeply rutted fields and up snowy hills without breaking a sweat Also smaller than in many alternatives is the Fiat Panda 4×4’s diminutive 0.9-litre petrol engine. It might only have two cylinders, but it packs a fairly decent 85hp punch so it doesn’t feel too sluggish. It’ll accelerate from 0-62mph in a reasonable 12.1sec, and Fiat claims it’ll return 57.6mpg – although you’ll probably see a figure closer to 45mpg in normal driving conditions. There’s also a 1.3-litre diesel you should consider if you do lots of motorway miles. It’s not as fast as the petrol, but it uses less fuel and it’s slightly quieter when you’re cruising along. Not that the Fiat Panda 4×4 feels particularly at home whizzing along at 70mph, that is. It’s much more adept nipping through town where its small size and relatively large windows make it a doddle to manoeuvre and easier to park than the larger Dacia Duster. The Fiat Panda 4×4 is pretty comfortable to drive over poorly maintained roads, too, and it doesn’t lean a great deal in tight corners – despite its jacked-up suspension that makes it taller than the standard Panda. Head off-road, and the Fiat Panda 4×4’s special tyres and four-wheel drive mean it’ll happily traipse through mud that’d leave most two-wheel-drive SUVs well and truly stuck. It doesn’t have quite the same boulder-traversing abilities as the Suzuki Jimny, but it’ll prove more than capable of dealing with a few inches of snow or a heavily rutted field. Unfortunately, the Fiat Panda 4×4 there is a fly in the ointment The Panda Cross – with which the 4×4 shares many components – earned a mediocre three-star safety rating when it was crash-tested by Euro NCAP in 2015. If, however, you’re looking for a cheap, cheerful 4×4 that won’t cost the earth to run you should still consider the Fiat Panda 4×4 – especially if you actually plan to use it off-road."

It might not have the retro looks of the Fiat 500 , but the Panda is stylish. Its upright body means there’s plenty of room inside and all models come with five doors for great access. Interior quality might not be up to the standards of a Volkswagen Up , but it’s fair to say that Fiat has harnessed a decent amount of charm. The Panda feels at its best in the city, where its small dimensions make it perfect for weaving through congested streets and squeezing into tight parking spaces. Small engines mean the Panda is also cheap to run, but not best-suited to fast-moving motorway traffic, where it can feel a little out of breath. There are two body styles available. The first is the regular Panda, which is available on the base trim and looks like a typical city car. You also have the Cross, which can be found on the three other trims, called Red, Garmin and Top. This has some extra body cladding and other rugged-looking features that give it some baby off-roader style. Pandas are cheap cars, which means standard equipment is pretty basic and includes items such as central locking, six airbags, a CD player and power steering that can be lightened at the touch of a button. Overall, the Fiat Panda is a charming and well-sorted small car that has plenty of appealing traits. The space on offer is quite impressive for such tiny dimensions, it’s cheap to buy and run and is abundant in style and character. There are a few rough edges here and there, and rivals such as the Kia Picanto and Volkswagen Up are very tempting alternatives to the funky Fiat. However, the Panda has a lot going for it, and is a much more capable all-rounder than the alternatives. It’s definitely worth considering if you’re in the market for such a car, so why not check out our Fiat Panda deals to see how much you could save? Or you could find a great deal on a used Fiat Panda from our network of trusted dealers, as well as browsing other used Fiats . When the time comes to sell your car , carwow can help with that, too. How much is the Fiat Panda? How much is the Fiat Panda? Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort The Fiat Panda’s steering is very light, making it easy to drive in town, but it can be quite uncomfortable at low speeds The Panda is a really good town runabout because the power steering features a handy city button, which makes it light and easy to use when completing low-speed manoeuvres such as three-point turns and reverse parking. It’s also surprisingly capable on motorway journeys – you’ll have to wring the engines out to make brisk progress, but there’s an impressive amount of refinement at higher speeds. That being said, there are a few niggles with the way the Panda drives. Although it’s quite fun to steer down twisty roads, the tiny 14-inch wheels fitted to basic models are wrapped in small tyres that run out of grip quite quickly if you really hoof it down your favourite country road. The ride quality can also get a bit fidgety at times, though admittedly it does smooth out as you go faster. Space and practicality Space and practicality The Panda has loads of room for passengers inside, but boot space is only average Practicality is quite good for such a small car – the seats for the driver and passenger are comfortable and offer plenty of room, although the steering wheel only adjusts for height. It’s also pretty roomy on the back seat and the rear bench can be slid backwards or forwards for more passenger space or a larger luggage capacity. Depending on how far back you have the rear seat, the Panda’s boot capacity ranges from 225 to 260 litres – so it’s about average for a class that includes the Skoda Citigo (251 litres), Hyundai i10 (252 litres) and Kia Picanto (200 litres). Total load space sits at 870 litres with the rear seats folded down. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories Some of the plastics are disappointingly hard and scratchy but the funky design more than compensates for small shortcomings The Panda’s body design is inspired by what Fiat dubs a “squircle” theme, and this has been carried over to the interior – the dial binnacles, button layouts, gear lever and even the steering wheel have a rounded square shape! Thankfully, the Panda’s cabin isn’t just funky to look at, it also feels robust if a little low on the soft-touch materials that you get in an Up. MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax There's just the one engine available with the Fiat Panda. It's a 1.0-litre petrol engine with mild hybrid assistance that makes 70hp. That's not much, but you don't need big power in a car this size. The benefit of this small engine is that running costs will be low. CO2 emissions are just 110g/km, which keeps your first-year vehicle excise duty cost down, while fuel economy is an impressive 57.6mpg. There's no automatic gearbox, meaning you're limited to a six-speed manual."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/fiat/500x,Fiat 500X Review & Prices,"€35,340",6/10,new,"Is the Fiat 500X a good car? Is the Fiat 500X a good car? The Fiat 500X isn’t a bad choice if you’re looking for a small, stylish SUV and find yourself put off by the bland looks of the SEAT Arona or the stodgy drive offered by the Citroen C3 Aircross . The 500X was launched in 2014 and – to help it keep pace with the SEAT and Citroen – got a facelift in 2018. Changes included an updated interior, a new infotainment system, extra safety kit and a couple of new petrol engines. The diesels from the old model have been dropped. In terms of exterior styling, only the lights have changed – you now get new daytime running lights and rear LEDs – so you’ll struggle to tell the difference between the old car and this 2018 model. You can also choose from two exterior (rather optimistically coined) ‘body styles’ – Urban Look, which has conventional body coloured bumpers or Cross Look which has chunkier bumpers with mock skid plates. The interior gets the same retro look as the outside, the large swathe of body-coloured plastic that runs across the dashboard gives the 500X a playful feel that’s missing from the dingy SEAT Arona . But, while the 2018 500X gets a new instrument binnacle and a new steering wheel, its interior plastics look cheap in places, particularly in the back, and its switches and buttons are a little flimsy. The infotainment system has also been updated but doesn’t have the clear graphics or ease of use you get in the SEAT’s system. You do, however, get Apple CarPlay and Android Auto as standard in the Fiat, so it is easy to use your smartphone’s apps on the car’s 7.0-inch screen. Up front, there’s plenty of space to get comfy even if you’re tall and someone of a similar size should be able to squeeze behind you, too. The Fiat has a slightly smaller boot than its aforementioned alternatives, but it is easy to load and has space for a couple of large suitcases. Filled to the brim with people and stuff, the 500X’s otherwise nippy 120hp petrol engine isn’t going to feel quick, but it’s still the engine to go for because the quicker 150hp 1.3-litre model’s standard automatic gearbox is frustratingly slow to change which blunts acceleration. It’s a shame the more powerful engine is spoiled because there’s not much wrong with the way the 500X drives. In town, you can zip in and out of gaps in traffic, while at faster speeds there’s not too much body lean to worry about and the Fiat’s weighty steering makes it easy to place in bends. On the motorway, the suspension smooths out bumps better than it does at slower speeds, although the cabin does suffer from a fair amount of wind noise.

How much is the Fiat 500X? How much is the Fiat 500X? Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort The 500X has comfy suspension that soaks up bumps well, resists body roll and feels nicely controlled at high speeds, but its automatic gearbox is a letdown The Fiat 500X is available with a choice of three petrol engines with 1.0, 1.3-litre and 1.6-litre capacities. Despite having the largest capacity, the 110hp 1.6-litre model’s old design and lack of turbocharger mean it is the slowest and least economical model in the range. It’s worth avoiding, as a result, despite being the cheapest option. The 120hp 1.0-litre petrol model is much more attractive. Its power hike might be modest on paper but it feels like a peppier performer than its 0-62mph time of 10.9 seconds might suggest. It’ll happily rev to more than 6,000rpm and pulls strongly to that point with a satisfying growl that suits the 500X ’s cheeky character. More to the point, it is cheap to run with Fiat quoting fuel economy of 47mpg – a real-world figure that should be more easily achieved than the pie-in-the-sky numbers that were quoted in the past. If you need more power – for example, if you’ll often be driving the car fully loaded – then it’s worth considering the 150hp 1.3-litre model. It gets from 0-62mph in 9.1 seconds, has more mid-range shove for quick overtakes and will still return decent fuel economy of 46mpg. The only downside is that comes with a six-speed automatic gearbox that’s slow to respond when you want a sudden burst of acceleration. Owning a car that is fun to drive might not be a huge priority if you’re looking for a sensible family car but, nevertheless, the Fiat 500x ’s direct steering and notchy gearbox mean it feels sportier than you might expect. In town, both the 1.0 and 1.4-litre models have all the punch you need to nip into and out of gaps in traffic and its accurate steering means you can nose into tight spaces confident that you’re not going to end up in a scrape. That said, it’s disappointing that automatic emergency braking doesn’t come fitted as standard. Although the pillars around the rear windscreen do cause a little bit of a blind spot (you can spec the optional blind spot alert to get around this), the 500X is still easy car to park and its raised driving position gives you a good view out the front of the car. Find yourself on a country road and the 500X ’s weighty steering means you can turn into bends with confidence that the car will respond as you expect and there isn’t much body lean to worry about. The 1.0-litre petrol model is actually a little bit nicer to drive because its lighter engine makes it feel a touch more agile. You’ll want to stick with the 1.4-litre model if you do lots of motorway driving, though. It has a little bit more power in reserve for overtakes and its slow automatic gearbox is less of an issue at higher speeds. Active cruise control is a new option that was added in 2018 and its ability to brake and accelerate the car automatically helps take the strain out of long drives, when combined with the standard lane assist, which can gently steer the car in lane. Space and practicality Space and practicality The Fiat 500X might look like the 500, but its larger size and rear doors make it much more practical. However, alternatives offer more flexibility and have bigger boots The 500X ’s cabin is roughly on par with family hatchbacks such as the Volkswagen Golf for space. Up front, tall adults will fit just fine and the front seats have a wide range of adjustment. The same is true of the steering wheel and the 500X’s raised height means you get a decent view out of the front of the car when driving. Even in the back, six-foot adults will fit with relative comfort, although a third passenger sitting in the middle will find their seat is uncomfortably hard and they’ll also be short on foot room because the front centre console intrudes into the floor. Unlike in the Citroen C3 Aircross , the Fiat’s back seat doesn’t recline and can’t be slid backwards and forwards to let you get a balance between boot space and rear legroom. The small rear doors mean access might be more of an issue and the hidden Isofix points make it tricky to fit a child seat. Although, the 500X’s height means you don’t have to bend your back too much to get it into position. The 500X has plenty of nooks and crannies to swallow the odds and sods that family life seems to accumulate. You get two gloveboxes and nets on the backs of the front seats, as well as a couple of cupholders and big door pockets up front, with smaller ones in the back. The centre front armrest also hides a deep pocket, although the way the whole assembly wobbles when you nudge it doesn’t exactly inspire confidence. The 500X ’s 350-litre boot is big enough to swallow a couple of suitcases and its low load lip and large boot opening make it easy to pack with luggage. You also get a large hidden cubby under the floor that’s big enough to hide large valuable such as a camera. There are no useful luggage clips or nets to help secure smaller, more awkward loads, but at least the rear seats fold flat leaving a nice flat floor that means you can slide longer items into place. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories The Fiat 500X’s interior is scattered with retro touches and its body coloured trim makes the cabin pop next to more bland alternatives, but interior quality could be improved upon From its three-spoke steering wheel to its cowled instruments, ball gear knob, body-coloured dashboard and candy-sweet button style – the 500X ’s cabin has all the style you’d expect of a car that was designed in Italy. Unfortunately, with the stereotypical positives come stereotypical negatives of questionable build quality, and buttons and switches that don’t work with the oily smoothness of, say, a German car (or, for that matter, a Spanish car designed in Germany). As a result, if you want your small SUV to feel bulletproof, you’ll be better off with the SEAT Arona with its VW parts, but only if you can live with a cabin so dark that you may as well be peering out into the edges of space. Every Fiat 500X comes with a seven-inch infotainment screen that is bright and colourful and doesn’t have the plasticky bezel found in the old model. It’s easy enough to use, although the lack of physical buttons can make the touchscreen a fiddle to operate when you’re driving. Plus, the reversing camera’s cloudy display can leave you wondering whether you have suddenly developed cataracts. There’s no shortage of features – such as voice recognition and text reading – and the system’s TomTom navigation is better at steering you around congestion than most other systems. Really, though, it’s easier to use the more intuitive menus of your smartphone because the 500X ’s infotainment system comes fitted with Apple Carplay and Android Auto as standard."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/fiat/500-electric,Fiat 500e Review & Prices,"€34,556",7/10,new,"Is the Fiat 500e a good car? Is the Fiat 500e a good car? This is the Fiat 500e, a city car with lovable retro-chic looks and an all-electric motor and battery – it's a bit like Greta Thunberg, because it's small and eco friendly. The 500e is a bit bigger and heavier than the petrol 500 that's also still on sale, but it still has diddy dimensions. If you're looking for a small EV there aren't many to choose from – but the Vauxhall Corsa Electric , BYD Dolphin and Peugeot e-208 are all great choices. Rather than add a bunch of fiddly details to the outside, Fiat’s gone back to basics and made the 500 look smoother, more rounded and even more minimalist than before. It’s like your grandad suddenly ditching the dyed comb-over and shaving his head instead. Smoother, simpler, cooler. For starters, the old car’s headlights have been ditched in favour of two semi-circular lamps with curved daytime-running lights that shine out through the bonnet. The flush door handles and hidden indicators are pretty much the only difference you’ll spot from the side, and the lack of an exhaust pipe is a dead giveaway that you’re looking at the new car from behind. OK, so the new Fiat 500e looks pretty similar to the old car on the outside, but it’s a totally different story inside. There’s a brand-new 7.0-inch digital dial display instead of traditional dials, and you get a big 10.25-inch touchscreen on the dashboard with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone mirroring. The physical controls for the heating and air conditioning are grouped together under the central touchscreen and there’s a storage tray where you’d find a gear lever in a petrol- or diesel-powered car. Space in the front is good for two adults and there are decent storage options, but the back seats cater for two only, and they’ll have to be quite small people at that. Fitting a child seat is pretty much impossible, too, while the 500’s boot is good for the weekly shop, but not much else. It is a city car , after all. The Fiat 500e comes with two battery options – one that offers a 115-mile range and another with a 199-mile range, which isn't great when each of the other alternatives can go comfortably more than 200 miles in official tests. You can recharge your 500 using a three-pin socket, but that’ll take all night – literally. You’ll be better off getting a wallbox to take advantage of AC charging up to 11kW (or 7.4kW if that's the maximum you can get at your house), which will charge the battery in under three hours. The quickest way to charge is using a public fast charger , with the Fiat 500 capable of taking up to 85kW. At these speeds it can go from empty to 80% charged in 35 minutes, and add a useful 30 miles of charge in just five minutes. The Fiat 500 comes with either a 95hp motor that can hustle it from 0-62mph in 9.5 seconds, or a 118hp electric motor with enough poke to accelerate it from 0-62mph in nine seconds. That doesn’t sound particularly fast but the new 500 will do 0-30mph in three seconds, which is nippy in town and faster than most small city cars. Also handy in town is the new 500’s automatic emergency braking that’ll spot pedestrians and cyclists in your path and automatically apply the brakes if it thinks you’re about to hit them. That’s in addition to adaptive cruise control that’ll accelerate and brake for you on motorways to keep you a safe distance from the car ahead. There are three driving modes, Normal, Range and Sherpa. Range mode uses the motor to recharge the batteries when you brake to help boost the Fiat 500’s range, while Normal model tones down this ‘regenerative braking’ effect. The Sherpa function limits the 500’s top speed to 50mph (down from 93mph) and turns off the air conditioning. These extreme measures will be useful in an emergency when you really need to eke out every last mile to reach a charging point. So, the Fiat 500 is now an electric city car, but we think you’ll agree it’s a good one, provided you don’t need lots of space or expect the last word in interior quality.

How much is the Fiat 500e? There isn’t a great deal of choice of small electric vehicles, but the Fiat 500e does stack up pretty well price-wise, being less expensive than key alternatives such as the Vauxhall Corsa, BYD Dolphin and Peugeot e-208. However, in recent years there have been a number of affordable electric cars that are cheaper and more spacious than the Fiat, with the MG4 EV having a similar price but being more practical with a longer range. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort The Fiat 500e is ideal for driving around town, but take it out of its natural habitat and things get a bit noisy and uncomfortable The Fiat 500 – the original and the new, modern day one – is synonymous with driving in towns and cities. Therefore, it’s no surprise that it excels in this environment. The steering is very light, meaning that tricky moves around corners, roundabouts or car parks are a doddle. Such is the weighting that it’s possible (although very much NOT recommended) to steer with one finger on the wheel. Another great attribute about the 500e is the turning circle, which – at under 10 metres – is pretty tight. In fact, it’s bettered only by the Honda e – and tighter than the likes of a Mini Electric. Put the car in ‘Range’ mode and the regenerative braking kicks in – and then some! It takes some getting used to – it almost feels like someone is putting their foot down hard on the brakes. But the one-pedal driving saves energy – and miles – which is useful if you are someone who suffers from range anxiety. Parking is also a beneficiary of the light steering, so tucking into tight spaces is made easier, and moves can also be dispatched quickly because the visibility is decent. The huge door mirrors and high-definition rear camera come into their own, here, too. Going a bit quicker, the car gets a bit more uncomfortable and isn’t the happiest navigating bumps in the road. Take the 500e out onto dual carriageways and motorways and you’ll notice that wind and tyre noise are quite prominent. It’s quite distracting, but might be expected given the size of the car and the emphasis on town driving, rather than performance at higher speeds. The 500e does offer automated cruise control as well as auto-steer to help keep safe and secure in what can be a challenging environment for city cars. With the lane-keeping technology, the steering inputs are noticeable, but that just proves that the technology is doing its job! Acceleration and overtaking times have been improved over the previous petrol 500, which will inspire confidence for those on main roads, or faced with lots of traffic to navigate. On country roads, the unsettled suspension is more noticeable than either in town or on the motorway. It feels like the car is constantly checking and re-checking where it is while trying to deal with the bumps in the road to the best of its ability. All in all, it doesn’t make for a very comfortable driving experience, although it is an improvement over the bouncy nature of the previous 500. The issue is that, for what is a small car, the 500e is relatively heavy, so the suspension has to be firm in order to prevent the body moving around more than it already does. The extra weight over the previous model means the 500e loses a bit of its agility in corners and the extra mass. However, as most of the weight gain is due to the batteries – housed in the floor – the centre of gravity is relatively low, meaning the body still doesn’t lean much. A Mini Electric is a more fun-to-drive experience, but the little Fiat still has its place and on looks and heritage alone will prove quite popular. Space and practicality Space and practicality There are loads of storage options in the front, but nothing for rear seat passengers. If you’re sat in the rear, it’s a bit cramped, but at least the boot is bigger than a Honda e! The 500e is a small car, so people might not expect acres of space to be given over to storage solutions. However, the door bins are wide enough for a generous sized bottle – at a squeeze – and there’s another storage area in between the front seats. Here you will also find a USB port and 12V socket to charge or run electronic devices. Lift the central armrest in the front (which can be moved forwards and backwards to suit your needs) and there’s another – really quite deep – storage area. And we’re not done yet! Closer to the floor, in between the front seats, there is a fold-out cupholder and the dash also integrates a surprisingly large glovebox for even more items to be stowed. The generosity of storage space doesn’t really extend to the rear of the car, with a lack of cupholders being an obvious omission. There aren’t any USB charging points or spaces for any belongings. There are only two seats in the rear of the 500e and, being honest, they are best suited to children or small adults. Anyone around 5ft 10 and above will be touching or hitting their head on the roof and will struggle with the leg and knee room in front of them when the front seats are in their natural position. Children will be fine, although it might be a bit of an issue carrying babies. There are easy access ISOFIX access points in the back, but trying to fit one of the more bulky rear-facing seats into the back will be a challenge, even with the front seats pushed right forwards. It is a small car, but the likes of the Honda e is bigger in the back and a more comfortable place to be. As you might expect, the boot isn’t huge in the 500e, but it’s enough room to squeeze in three small suitcases and at 185 litres. The Peugeot e-208 is cavernous by comparison at 311 litres, while the Vauxhall Corsa has 287 litres. Of course, the rear seats can be folded down, but you don’t get a flat floor so some items might move around or end up on top of each other. The seat backs are also metal instead of fabric, which means loads may slide across the less grippy surface unless they are secured in place. However, there is a huge opening because the tailgate is very tall. Therefore access to the boot is a plus point. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories The 500e’s interior has lots of clever and detailed touches, but the quality isn’t quite up to scratch in some places The inside of the Fiat 500e is very different to the previous model, with more options to customise trims and materials across the dash. There are also lots of great design features that mix up retro and modern in the overall appearance. There’s a chunky two-spoke steering wheel that offers good rake and reach adjustment, which means getting your ideal driving position is straightforward. Despite the overall dimension of the 500 being quite compact, there is plenty of headroom inside, while the seats offer plenty of movement up, down, forwards and backwards. The climate control buttons have been kept separate from the infotainment functions, meaning they are much easier to use – no clicking or swiping through menus to find the specific thing you want to change here! Sat just below the climate controls are the gear selector buttons. Again, very obvious and very easy to use. Meanwhile, the infotainment system is also an impressive piece of kit. Base models get a 7.0-inch version, which is good enough, although upgrading to the 10.25-inch option is very much worth it. The graphics are nice and clear, the menus are well structured and it is responsive to touch inputs. The 500 offers wireless connectivity to Apple CarPlay and Android Auto , should you not want to rely on the in-car systems. All 500e models feature digital dials as part of the driver display. It’s pretty simplistic but demonstrates all of the information that you would need while either driving or parked up. Steering-wheel mounted buttons can be used to scroll through the menus and there is a voice assistant onboard, too. As well as media, trip information and phone records, there’s also details about the battery’s state of charge and power available. The 500e is slightly let down when it comes to the fit and finish of the interior and some of the materials have a ‘low cost’ feel about them. But there is a certain charm about the inside overall, with visual nods to Turin, the home of the car, all around. Electric range, charging and tax Electric range, charging and tax There are two choices of battery in the Fiat 500e. The smaller one is a 24kWh pack, which provides a theoretical range of 115 miles and can be charged at up to 50kW - meaning a 10-80% charge takes 24 minutes. With that model, you get a 93hp motor, but it still provides ample power and performance, especially in town. Those looking for a bit more from their 500e can opt for the larger, 42kWh battery, which boosts the range up to a maximum of 199 miles. Charging can be done at up to 85kW on a fast charger, allowing for 10-80% charging in 35 minutes. Power-wise, we’re talking 118hp for the motor, which enables a zero to 60mph time of nine seconds. Realistically, the 500e's range varies drastically depending on what type of driving you're doing. In mixed mileage and round town, you can get pretty close to the claimed range. In motorway driving, you'll see around 120 miles The driving range betters the Honda e, from which you wouldn't even see 100 miles of motorway range, but all other small electric cars can go further between charges. For example, you can get up over 200 miles of range from the BYD Dolphin or the Peugeot e-208. Charging the 500e via the three-pin plug will take too many hours for some people, so it is worth investing in the optional 11kW charging cable, to bring charging times down to a more reasonable period of time. Being an electric car, there are no CO2 emissions, no charge for VED and company car tax rates are much lower than petrol- or diesel-powered vehicles. Safety and security Safety and security The Fiat 500e scored a reasonable four stars out of five when tested by Euro NCAP in late 2022. While it might not have got a maximum score, it fared much better than the Renault Zoe, which surprisingly came away from the evaluation with zero stars. Adult occupant and child occupant safety were rated at 76% and 80% respectively. Meanwhile, scores for vulnerable road users and safety assist (both 67%) didn’t fare quite as well. Onboard the 500e offers front airbags and belt pretensioners and load limiters all round, but no knee airbags are anywhere to be seen. There are side head and chest airbags, but no pelvis protection. From a safety perspective, the 500e’s lane keeping technology, cruise control and keyless operation are welcomed, especially in this class of vehicle. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems Fiat does not have a great history when it comes to reliability and the brand has featured near the bottom of numerous customer surveys. However the 500e might be the car to change all that and, although it’s relatively early days, the signs are good. The 500e comes with a standard three-year warranty and there is the option to extend that by either 12 or 24 months, should you wish to get some extra peace of mind during your Fiat ownership."

Is the Fiat 500 Electric Convertible a good car? If you want to buy an electric car but don’t want to give up the glamour of good looks and an open roof, then the Fiat 500 Electric Convertible is one of very few options available to you. Based on the regular Fiat 500 Electric hatchback, but with a fabric roof that opens back past the rear window, it’s one of just three electric convertible cars you can buy in 2025 - joining the MG Cyberster and the Maserati GranCabrio Folgore. If the regular 500 Electric is a glittery shoe, then the Convertible model is the open-toed version. Unlike the MG or Maserati, it’s not a ‘full’ convertible as the doors and roof rails stay in place - but it’s still a great way to get the wind in your hair without sacrificing much everyday usability. The more natural alternative to the 500 Electric are other small electric cars, such as the Mini Cooper Electric or Peugeot E-208 . Styling-wise, there’s little to separate the Convertible from its hatchback sibling. In fact, from the front, there are no changes at all - the only difference is the Convertible’s fabric roof and its smaller boot opening. You still get the same retro-cool styling, with a minimalist look and a rounded silhouette. You also get a selection of eye-catching colours, ranging from a bright acid green more suited to the Abarth 500e to classy metallic pale blue or rose gold. With lots of shiny chrome trim, the 500 Electric Convertible is a real jewellery box of a car. Range: 185 miles Efficiency: 4.4mi/kWh Battery size: 42kWh Max charge speed: 85kW Charge time AC: 6hrs 0 - 100% Charge time DC: 30 mins 10 - 80% Charge port location: Right rear Power output: 118hp And just like a jewellery box, there’s not much room inside for anything bigger than a necklace. As with the 500 Electric hatchback, while the front seats are reasonably accommodating for adults, the rear seats are suitable only for the smallest of children. Interior storage is also pretty poor while the boot is a minuscule 185 litres accessed through a tiny rear hatch. But a convertible car isn’t really about practicality, it’s about the experience. The 500 Electric Convertible’s roof has two positions - one where it acts like a big sunroof, and another where it rolls back over the rear window to give a real open-air feeling. While it’s not as bracing as a proper convertible, it’s still a great way to get the wind in your hair, and is actually fantastic in terms of refinement and wind intrusion - you could happily have the roof fully open on the motorway and still have a conversation with someone inside. There’s just one battery and motor combination for the 500 Electric Convertible, which provides a maximum of 185 miles of range and a weak-sounding 118hp. In reality, performance is ample, with a zippy feel around town and more than enough grunt to tackle the occasional faster road. However, the tiny battery pack and relatively slow charging mean that repeated longer journeys in the 500 Electric Convertible are best avoided.

How much is the Fiat 500 Electric Convertible? How much is the Fiat 500 Electric Convertible? With a starting price of more than £30,000 nobody’s going to accuse the Fiat 500 Electric Convertible of being a bargain - you’re paying a lot for those cool looks when you consider that a larger, more powerful and longer-range MG4 EV costs around 2/3 of that with Carwow discounts. Even the brilliant Kia EV3 , a proper family-sized SUV, only costs an extra couple of thousand pounds. All 500 Electric convertible models come with keyless entry, a big infotainment screen with wireless smartphone connectivity, digital instrument cluster, cruise control and a premium sound system, its status as a city car means you miss out on some of the ‘big-car’ equipment you might expect for the price, such as electric seat adjustment, ambient lighting or dual-zone climate control. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort Fantastic to drive around town and capable on faster roads, but a bit bouncy for regular long trips You’d certainly expect the Fiat 500 to be a great car for driving around town - it’s practically made for nipping around the city centre of Rome. The steering is ultra-light and very responsive, so it’s really easy to manoeuvre through tight gaps or into tiny parking spaces - helped by the turning circle of less than 10 metres. Visibility out of the front is very good thanks to a big windscreen and large side windows. The view rearward isn’t quite as good as it is in the hatchback - the rear window is smaller, and when the roof is down it becomes totally obscured - but thankfully there are nice big door mirrors and standard rear parking sensors that mean you don’t feel the sting of it too much. The 500 Electric Convertible has plenty of power off the line - it’s really nippy up to 30mph, and with no gears to worry about it’s an absolute doddle to get up to speed. There’s also a neat one-pedal drive mode which means you rarely have to put your foot on the brake, making things even easier. And while the suspension is quite bouncy, that’s mostly a product of the car being so short - it does deal pretty well with lumps and bumps, at least as neatly as a Hyundai i10 or Mini Cooper . The 500 Electric Convertible isn’t in its natural environment on the motorway, but it’s not all bad. For such a small car, it’s remarkably stable and settled at high speeds, and despite having just 118hp on tap it can accelerate smartly up to speed on a short sliproad. However, wind and road noise are pronounced, and the light steering can feel a little twitchy when you’re changing lanes. The La Prima trim level comes with adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping assist and traffic jam assist, which are quite sophisticated features for a small car, and generally work well. The more limiting factor for motorway driving is the range, which while it’s pretty good around town or in mixed mileage does plummet to around 100 miles on a cross-country motorway run. On bumpy country roads the Fiat 500 Electric’s short wheelbase and firm suspension do mean it’s a bit of a bouncy ride. It’s an improvement over the petrol Fiat 500, but any physically larger electric car of a similar price - such as the MG4 , BYD Dolphin or Peugeot E-208 - feels much more settled and reassuring in the bends. The 500 Electric doesn’t lean very much, though, which is often a problem with cars that are both narrow and tall. You can thank the batteries for that, as they’re placed low down in the car’s structure to give it quite a low centre of gravity. The light steering doesn’t provide much feedback and the driving experience is more tolerable than it is enjoyable. A Mini Cooper Electric is much more fun to hoon about a good road with. Space and practicality Space and practicality Roomy front seats, but that’s about it - the 500 Electric Convertible is not a practical car In terms of interior space, the Fiat 500 Electric Convertible offers exactly what you’d expect from looking at it. This is a very short, quite narrow car, and instead of being an efficient box it’s curvy and shapely - so you shouldn’t expect MPV-like levels of interior room. What you do get are two quite accommodating front seats that support even larger drivers well. There’s a reasonable level of adjustment, and the steering wheel moves for reach as well as rake. But the seat base is set quite high due to the batteries underneath it, so taller drivers may find their head brushing the roof - and that their hair is particularly susceptible to being buffeted about when the roof is down. Interior storage is moderate. The door bins are quite small, but there’s a reasonable glovebox. The centre console is set low and has some of the driving controls as well as the USB inputs, while a cupholder is set deep into it. A second one flips out from the front. However, without that one flipped down, the 500 Electric does provide step-through access, which is really useful in the city, allowing you to easily slide over and get out on either side of the car. Nothing big or clever about the 500 Electric Convertible’s back seats. Access is quite tight through the front doors - and unlike most convertibles, because the door frames stay put, it’s no easier with the roof down either. Once back there, you’ll find room for only two very short adults. There are ISOFIX points on both rear seats (as well as one in the front) but reaching back to fit a child seat requires a fair bit of contortion. With just 185 litres of space the Fiat 500 Electric Convertible’s boot is about as small as they come. It’s accessed through a tiny hatch, making room for the electric roof mechanism. You’ll be able to fit maybe three supermarket bags-for-life’s worth of shopping, or a couple of carry-on suitcases. Anything larger and you’ll have to make use of the back seats. The rear seats do fold easily and lay relatively flat, though there’s a bit of a step from the boot floor. They’re also clad in metal, which is nice and hardwearing and means it’s easy to slide items around. Just remember everything’s either going to have to fit through the boot’s little letterbox slot, or be loaded in through the open roof. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories Stylish, easy to use and well-built - but doesn’t quite feel up to the price The Fiat 500 Electric’s interior feels much more upmarket than the old petrol 500’s did. It’s dominated by two screens - a wide 10.0-inch display for infotainment, and a smaller, square 7.0-inch screen for driver information. Underneath the central screen sits a set of climate control buttons (hooray!) as well as four buttons for the drive selection in place of a stalk or gear lever. The centre console houses the electric handbrake, the volume control and the drive mode selector, allowing you to choose ‘Range’ mode (which ramps up the regenerative braking) or ‘Sherpa’ mode (which limits your top speed, turns off the heating and air-conditioning, and reduces performance all to get you the best possible range). You do get some quite nice touches. The wireless charging pad has a silhouette of the Turin skyline etched into it, while the door pulls have little Fiat 500s in them. Speaking of the doors, they’re fitted with electronic latches which open at the press of a button - though there are physical releases in the door bins should these break. Build quality is up to snuff with very few creaks or rattles, but materials do feel quite cheap considering the 500 Electric Convertible costs more than £30,000. The dashboard plastics, door cards and seat upholstery are on the scratchier side, while a cheaper MG4 has soft-touch materials in these places. Electric range, charging and tax Electric range, charging and tax The Fiat 500 Electric Convertible officially returns a range of 185 miles. With plenty of town driving, you’ll probably get quite close to that figure. The problem is that on faster roads, the range tumbles to the point where on a long motorway run you’ll likely see around 110-120 miles - which means 100 miles between charges so that you’ve a little in reserve. That can quickly become tiring and means the 500 Electric is much better suited for working in a city or as a second car, rather than a primary vehicle for long drives. Compare that to an MG4, Peugeot E-208 or BYD Dolphin, all of which will comfortably return over 200 miles for the same or less money, and the 500’s range starts to become problematic. Even the Citroen e-C3 , which costs barely 2/3 of the Fiat, has a longer range. The maximum charging rate is only 85kW, but since the 500 Electric’s battery is quite small, you should still see a 10-80% top-up in just 30 minutes. Other running costs are minimal. The 500 Electric Convertible is in a much higher insurance group than the old petrol 500 but it doesn’t pay road tax due to being an electric car, and if you can get it as a company car you’ll enjoy the same low BIK rates as any electric vehicle. Safety and security Safety and security The Fiat 500 Electric hatchback scored four stars when it was tested by Euro NCAP in 2021, and the Convertible shares that rating. The fact that Fiat retains the roof rails and door frames between the hatch and Convertible means the two should perform very similarly in an accident. Standard safety equipment includes all the basics such as autonomous emergency braking, traffic sign recognition and lane-keeping aids, though if you opt for the La Prima model you also get some semi-autonomous driving functions such as adaptive cruise control and lane-following assist - quite rare to find on such a small car. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems Fiat came next-to-last in the 2024 Driver Power owner satisfaction survey , which isn’t a very good sign - and Fiat’s reputation doesn’t stand it in good stead for future dependability. The 500 Electric is at least a fairly simple car, electric vehicles having far fewer moving parts than their petrol or hybrid counterparts. It’s been recalled once, in 2022. Warranty cover is just three years with a separate eight-year, 100,000-mile warranty on the battery pack. That’s pretty poor compared to the MG4’s seven-year cover."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/fiat/124-spider,Fiat 124 Spider Review and Prices,"€28,846",7/10,new,"The Fiat 124 Spider is basically a Mazda MX-5 in a sharp Italian suit. The two cars were developed alongside each other and – along with the Abarth 124 Spider, which is also based on the same platform – are effectively your only options if you want an affordable two-seat sports car. However, if you were happy to spend a bit more, you might also consider the Audi TT Roadster or Mercedes SLC. Among the biggest differences between the Mazda and the Fiat is the way they look, with Fiat deciding to ape the classic Fiat 124 Sport Spider that was first produced back in the 1960s. So, instead of the Mazda’s more edgy lines, the Fiat has a more rounded, curvy look. The 124 interior design has been copied almost exactly from the MX-5. So, you sit nice and low – as you should in a sports car – and there are plenty of sporty touches to be enjoyed, such as gazing down the long bonnet and taking in the fact that each dial is in its own individually housing. If you go for a higher-end model, you get a 7-inch display that sprouts from the top of the dashboard, just like in the Mazda. The Fiat also follows the Mazda, in that there’s plenty of space inside for a couple of adults, too. Getting a comfortable driving position should be simple unless you’re over six feet tall. And, what few changes there are bring welcome improvements. For example, the Fiat has more soft-touch plastics dotted around, while the classy trim pieces give the 124 Spider a more premium feel. As you can probably imagine, boot space is not the 124’s forte, although it will take 140 litres. That’s 10 litres more than in the Mazda and enough for a couple of soft bags, but not a lot else. Where you will notice a bit more difference is in how the two cars drive. Not only does the Fiat have a different engine – Mazda’s non-turbocharged 1.5-litre petrol unit has been replaced by a turbocharged 1.4-litre – Fiat has also fettled the steering, suspension and brakes. Together, these give the 124 its own unique character, so that it has the more comfortable feel of a small grand tourer. As it has some extra pulling power from its turbocharged engine, the Fiat makes a very effective cruiser. It doesn’t need (or want) to be revved hard to get the best performance and there’s enough power to overtake without having to frantically change down a gear. Then again, that’s not a chore, because the gearbox is slick. Clearly, Fiat has taken to heart that line about ‘If you can’t beat them, join them’. There’s no better way to make a great sports car than to start with the Mazda MX-5. On more open roads, the engine’s healthy torque levels make it easier to kick the back end out on long sweeping corners. However, the car is not quite as fun to drive flat out as you might expect, because the steering has marginally less feel than the Mazda’s set-up and could be quicker to turn the wheels. The suspension strikes a good balance between remaining comfortable even on poorly surfaced roads and being able to tackle corners with gusto. Essentially, the 124 Spider is only a little softer than the MX-5 and it’s still a finely balanced rear-wheel drive car that keen drivers will love. Yes, you can feel some vibrations through the body and steering wheel – as you can on many convertibles – but not in a way that detracts heavily from the drive. While the 124’s engine gives it a laid back character, it’s hard to argue with a 0-62mph time of 7.5 seconds, making the basic Fiat a quicker sprinter than the entry-level Mazda MX-5. However, if you’re pressing on down your favourite country back road, the news isn’t all golden. A chief complaint is that the engine has little interest in revving. At lower speeds, it struggles until the turbo comes on song, while at the top end, the power tails off long before you reach the rev limiter. Keep it working in the mid-range and all is well, but this is not a plucky little sports car that loves to be thrashed. And, although there’s a nice burble from the twin exhausts at low speeds, the rest of the time it sounds ordinary – even somewhat strained at higher revs. That idea that the 124 is more of a grand tourer is reflected in the car’s standard equipment. It covers all the basics, including cruise control, air conditioning and 16-inch alloy wheels, but Lusso is arguably the trim to go for, with 17-inch alloys, a leather interior, climate control and rear parking sensors. For all the similarities with the MX-5, the 124 offers something a little different. From its more conservative styling to its torquey engine and softer suspension, it’s a more relaxing car than the MX-5 was ever meant to be."

The Fiat 500 is perfectly suited to short urban commutes or popping into town. In the same way you wouldn’t wear a miniskirt and heels for climbing Mount Snowdon, and you wouldn’t wear tweeds and brogues to the beach, you wouldn’t buy a 500 for long cross-country schleps. The compact city car is something of a dying breed, but if you’re shopping for a Fiat 500 then you could also consider the Toyota Aygo X , Kia Picanto or the Renault Clio . The little Fiat has all these cars beaten on the style front though, offering a unique splash of retro chic. Things get even funkier inside, where the body-coloured dashboard and optional white steering wheel help lift the ambience nicely. The seats themselves aren’t the comfiest, but there’s plenty of adjustment to help you get a good view out and all the controls are grouped sensibly together so they’re a doddle to use. That said, the Fiat 500’s 7.0-inch touchscreen infotainment system takes a bit of getting used to thanks to the fiddly menus, but you can always use the standard-fit Apple CarPlay or Android Auto instead. Sadly, there isn’t much you can do about the Fiat 500’s cramped seats. Two adults in the front will be fine, but anyone close to six-feet tall will struggle for knee- and headroom in the back, and there isn’t a great deal of space in the Fiat 500’s boot for everyone’s luggage. You probably won’t be packing the Fiat 500 with loads of bulky baggage though, will you? More likely you’ll be doing the school run, heading to work or popping to the shops. In these respects, it does a great job. Kids will have no trouble jumping into the back and the Fiat 500’s small size makes it just the thing for nipping through traffic and squeezing into tight parking spaces. Its 1.0-litre mild hybrid petrol engine is best suited to town driving as well, and it’s pretty economical. The great all-round visibility and light steering also help to make light work of tight car parks. Sure, it isn’t the most comfortable small car out there and it’s a bit noisy at speed, but it’ll tackle a twisty country road without much body lean and all models come with cruise control to help make the occasional motorway journey a bit more bearable. It’s just a shame that you can’t get the Fiat 500 with automatic emergency braking. However, you shouldn’t let this put you off if you’re looking for a seriously stylish city car that’s cheap to run, easy to drive and comes with plenty of personalisation options.

The Fiat 500 is dearer than a lot of its alternatives, but not by a huge amount. The Hyundai i10 is around £800 cheaper, while the Kia Picanto undercuts it by over £1,000. The Toyota Aygo X is also a few hundred pounds less expensive, and it comes with a lot more standard equipment. That said, the 500 still has an adequate amount of kit on board. All cars get a 7.0-inch touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, cruise control, a leather steering wheel and a panoramic glass roof. If you want luxuries like heated seats and keyless entry though you’re out of luck. Go and check out a mid-spec Kia Picanto instead. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort The Fiat 500 is great to drive in town, but feels out of its depth when venturing on to the motorway The urban jungle is where the Fiat 500 feels most at home. Its compact dimensions make it easy to thread through gaps in traffic, and you sit surprisingly high up for a small car giving you great all-round visibility. The steering is also nice and light, and it can be made even more effortless by pressing the city button on the dashboard. This combined with a tight turning circle makes it a doddle to negotiate tight car parks. If you want an automatic gearbox to take the strain out of stop-start traffic, then it’s bad news. The Fiat 500 is only offered with a six-speed manual gearbox, so you’ll have to look at something like a Toyota Aygo X if you want two pedals. On the plus side, the clutch is light and easy to use, and the gear shift is precise as well. The suspension does a pretty good job of absorbing bumps in the road, although particularly large potholes will send a thud through the cabin. The only thing disturbing the peace inside is the 1.0-litre engine, which you need to rev out to get any sort of performance from it. On the plus side, the mild hybrid system will save you fuel when coasting. Things start to unravel when you hit the motorway though. Being a cheap city car there’s not much insulation, which means wind and road noise are pretty intrusive. You may find yourself having to raise your voice to hold a conversation. The suspension also becomes unsettled at speed, with the body wobbling over bumps, and you’ll find yourself making constant steering adjustments to stay on the straight and narrow. There’s no option of adaptive cruise control either, although normal cruise control does come as standard as a consolation prize. A Renault Clio will be a better bet if you do a lot of motorway miles. Adequate is the best way to describe the Fiat 500 on a twisty road. It doesn't roll too much through the corners and the steering is precise. The suspension may do a decent job of mitigating body roll, but it can get jiggly over bumps and undulating surfaces making it feel quite unsettled. A Kia Picanto is more comfortable for back-road commuting, and a SEAT Ibiza is more fun to drive. If it’s hot hatch thrills you’re after then check out the Abarth 595 , a sportier and more raucous version of the 500. Space and practicality Space and practicality Even for a tiny city car the Fiat 500 isn’t particularly spacious, however kids should be fine in the back The Fiat 500 is a very small car, but most people will be able to find a comfortable driving position. That said, the steering wheel only adjusts for height, and even then it doesn’t move much, so you’ll need to try one out to make sure it suits you. There’s plenty of adjustment in the seats, although you are perched pretty high up so especially tall adults may struggle for headroom. The seats themselves aren’t particularly supportive, and you may find yourself with backache after a long stint behind the wheel. Interior storage isn’t great either. You get a pretty below-average glovebox, some tiny door bins and a couple of cupholders which aren’t really deep enough for a lot of drinks. There’s also a weird slot behind these cupholders which looks like it should house your phone while it’s plugged in, but unless you’re still using an iPhone 4 it won’t fit. This means you end up with nowhere to put your phone if it’s charging. Things don’t improve much in the rear seats, where only children will find themselves with enough space. Legroom is especially tight and headroom isn’t great. There are also only two seat belts back there, not that you’d want to try and get three across the bench anyway. You won’t find much space for your bits and bobs either. Both rear passengers have to fight over one central cup holder, and there are no USB charging points in sight. Fitting a child seat is a mixed bag. Unlike many alternatives, the 500 is only available as a three-door. This makes the process tricky to begin with, but the front doors do open nice and wide - provided you have enough space around the car. Once you’ve threaded the seat through then locating the ISOFIX anchor points is easy, however you will have to move the passenger seat forward to accommodate bulky rear-facing chairs. You may be thinking that Fiat has sacrificed rear seat space to give the 500 a cavernous boot, well sadly not. You get a pretty meagre 185 litres of space with the rear seats up, 70 litres down on the Picanto’s luggage capacity. If you need a lot more space for the money then the Dacia Sandero has a much more generous 328 litres on offer. Fold the rear seats down and you have up to 550 litres to play with, which is just over half what you get in the Picanto. The load lip is pretty high as well making loading heavy items a chore, and there’s a big ridge in the floor when the seats are folded to try and haul things over. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories The Fiat 500 has a super stylish and colourful interior, but it’s let down by sub-par material quality The 500’s cabin carries over some of the retro design cues of the exterior to make it look and feel totally unique. The splash of colour across the dashboard is a nice touch, and everything is logically laid out. The entry-level car gets physical knobs for the climate control like you might find on a car from the 90s, but they’re really simple to grab on the move. Higher-spec Top models get climate control with small displays showing the temperature which also works well. Being on the cheaper side of things you can’t expect the material quality to rival something like a Volkswagen Polo , and it doesn’t. Everything is hard and scratchy, while some of the controls such as the steering column stalks feel a bit flimsy. The Hyundai i10 feels more solidly screwed together. In terms of infotainment, all models get a 7.0-inch touchscreen as standard with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. It’s good to have the smartphone mirroring, because the native Fiat system is pretty tricky to navigate and the screen isn’t very responsive to your inputs. Range-topping cars get a small digital driver’s display behind the steering wheel, and it shows you everything you need to know in a clear and concise way. It’s not particularly customisable, but it’s better than the displays you get in an Aygo X or i10. MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax There’s just one engine option for the Fiat 500, and it’s a 1.0-litre three-cylinder petrol with 70hp and mild hybrid tech. That allows for marginally better fuel economy than a car without it, but it does nothing to aid the rather pedestrian performance. Fiat claims this car will return 61mpg, which is about the same as most alternatives. You may see this dip when you work the engine hard though, something you find yourself doing a lot to get up to speed on faster roads. The 500 does come in on the lower end of the first-year Vehicle Excise Duty scale thanks to its low emissions of 108g/km of CO2, and it won’t attract too much in the way of Benefit In Kind (BIK) tax either. Safety and security Safety and security The Fiat 500 scored three out of five stars when it was tested by Euro NCAP back in 2017, meaning it’s not the safest small car out there, and the test has become even stricter since then. The Toyota Aygo X scored four stars, as did the Kia Picanto when fitted with optional safety equipment. The 500’s main downfall was on driver assistance tech. There’s no lane-keeping assist, adaptive cruise control or autonomous emergency braking fitted here, which leaves it lagging behind most new cars today. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems The Fiat 500 isn’t a particularly complicated car, so there aren’t many horror stories to report when it comes to reliability. For added peace of mind you get a three-year or 60,000-mile warranty, however this isn’t a patch on Kia’s seven years of coverage. Toyota even offers up to 10 years if you keep your car serviced on time within its network."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/fiat/qubo,Fiat Qubo Review and Prices,Not found,4/10,Info not available,"The Fiat Qubo is a small MPV with a roomy interior and a very practical boot. If you’re searching for a bigger alternative to a small hatchback and don’t fancy an SUV, this funky-looking, boxy car could be the answer. If the Fiat Qubo will likely remind you of a small van with windows, that’ll be because it uses plenty of the same mechanical bits and bobs as the Italian firm’s smallest commercial vehicle. As a result, it doesn’t have quite the same street-cred as an equally tall and boxy SUV, but you won’t have any trouble finding it in a crowded supermarket car park. The Fiat Qubo’s interior carries on the theme set out by its boxy exterior. The dashboard is pretty plain, save for a few silver plastic panels, but at least the knobs for the heating and the buttons for the stereo are easy to reach. It doesn’t feel as plush or as solid as many similarly priced hatchbacks, however, and you can’t add any colour to the Qubo’s pretty drab interior with any posher trims or colourful inserts. Almost every surface feels hard and brittle too, but at least you get a rubber floor as standard which is a doddle to keep clean. This form-over-function approach runs right the way through the Fiat Qubo’s cabin. There are acres of headroom, the front doors open nice and wide and the back doors slide rather than swing open so it’s easy for passengers to climb in – even in tight parking spaces. If you’re looking for an unashamedly practical box on wheels, the budget-minded Fiat Qubo makes a good choice. Just don’t expect it to win any admiring glances… Once inside, they’ll find there’s loads of legroom to stretch out – even if they’re tall and sit behind a six-foot driver. The three back seats are all equally wide so you can carry three adults at once without anyone fighting over who has to sit in the middle seat. If no-one’s tagging along for the ride you can flip the back seats forward and use the Fiat Qubo to carry absolutely masses of luggage. The boot’s wide and square and comes without any kind of load lip so it’s dead easy to slide in some heavy furniture. You can even fold the front passenger seat forward to carry really long items. With the back seats in place, the Qubo can carry about the same amount as a small family hatchback such as the Skoda Fabia. Speaking of which, the Fiat Qubo feels remarkably like a conventional hatchback to drive – despite its boxy shape and tall body. Sure, you’d never call it fun, but it irons out bumps reasonably well around town and doesn’t lean excessively on twisty roads. You can get the Fiat Qubo with one petrol and one diesel engine. Neither are particularly gutsy, but the latter’s your best bet if you spend any length of time on the motorway while the petrol will suit inner-city drivers better. You can’t get the Qubo with any particularly clever safety feature like you can in most small hatchbacks or SUVs, but when it comes to outright load-carrying ability, this quirky van-based MPV offers decent value for money.

Unlike the standard 500L, you can choose to have the larger 500L MPW fitted with an extra row of seats in the boot to let you carry seven people. In this respect, it’s similar to the Citroen Grand C4 SpaceTourer and Renault Grand Scenic – all are roomier seven-seat alternatives of existing family MPVs. Unfortunately for the Fiat 500L MPW, its bulbous balloon-like looks aren’t a patch on the futuristic Citroen or the comparatively slinky Renault. At least it’ll stand out in a crowded car park, though – if not for particularly favourable reasons. Thankfully, things improve when you look at the Fiat 500L MPWs interior. It might not be quite as funky as the Grand C4 SpaceTourer inside, but the 500L MPW’s retro white dials, metal-effect air vents and colourful glossy plastic trims make it look much more interesting than the rather drab cabin in a Grand Scenic. Sure, there are a few hard plastics dotted about the place, most noticeably lower down on the doors and dashboard, but the Fiat 500L MPW feels rugged enough to stand up to the rigours of the school run. The Fiat 500L MPW’s infotainment system’s small screen, clunky menus and low-rent graphics do let the side down a bit, though. You won’t have any trouble getting comfy in the 500L MPW’s front seats if you’re very tall and the middle row is roomy enough for three adults to sit side-by-side – if not quite as comfortably as in the Renault and Citroen. You might want to consider the Fiat 500L MPW over the standard 500L if you regularly carry large luggage or a few extra young passengers. Sadly, the optional third row of seats in the boot is much more cramped. There’s space for two kids, but even small adults will find their knees pushing uncomfortably into the seats in front. At least the back seats are easy to access using levers that flip the middle row forward, and the Fiat 500L MPW’s large windows mean none of your passengers will feel claustrophobic or car-sick on long drives. There’s barely any space left in the boot with the rearmost seats occupied, but fold them forward and you’ve plenty of space for a baby buggy and some suitcases. You can also fold down the middle row if you need to carry something large like a bike or some flat-pack furniture. Navigating the Fiat 500L MPW through crowded car parks with plenty of luggage in tow is a doddle. The steering is very light and the large windows give you a great view out. The Fiat’s suspension does a reasonable job smoothing out bumps around town and its tall body doesn’t lean a great deal on twisty country roads, either. The Fiat 500L MPW’s 1.4-litre petrol engine is a good choice if you take in a mix of motorway and town driving, but one of the 1.3-litre and 1.6-litre diesel units will be more suitable if you do lots of long journeys. You can also get the 1.3-litre model with an automatic gearbox to save you making numerous gearchanges in heavy traffic – just don’t expect it to feel particularly spritely when you accelerate hard. Cruise control comes as standard across the 500L MPW range, but only high-spec Trekking models come with automatic emergency braking. Despite this, if you’re looking for a practical MPV with space in the very back for an occasional sixth and seventh passenger, the Fiat 500L MPW is worth considering.

The Fiat Tipo Station Wagon is a more spacious alternative to the standard Tipo hatchback . It doesn’t look or feel as special as the Ford Focus Estate or Vauxhall Astra Sports Tourer , but it is roomy, practical and costs less to buy than those alternatives. The standard Fiat Tipo is one of the more forgettable hatchbacks on sale, and the Station Wagon’s boxier back end does little to improve things. High-spec cars get a few shiny chrome trims below the windows and around the grille, but neither these – nor the metal C-shaped frames around the foglights – are quite enough to make the Tipo Station Wagon stand out . Step inside, and this slightly bland theme continues. Sure, the Fiat Tipo Station Wagon’s interior is neatly laid out and all the heating controls are easy to use, but none of the materials feels quite as nice as in the Vauxhall and Ford and you can’t spice things up with any brightly coloured trims like in the smaller Fiat 500 hatchback . The Fiat Tipo Station Wagon’s infotainment display isn’t much to shout about either. All but the most basic models get a 5-inch screen but it doesn’t look as smart as the Ford’s unit and isn’t particularly intuitive to use. The Fiat Tipo Station Wagon comes with height-adjustable front seats as standard so there’s plenty of space for you to get comfy. There’s enough room in the back for two adults or three kids to stretch out, but the Ford Focus Estate has significantly more knee room and its central seat doesn’t feel quite as cramped. It’s a similar story when you come to load the Fiat Tipo Station Wagon’s boot. There’s space for a few suitcases or a baby buggy, but the Ford Focus Estate and VW Golf Estate are roomier still. Flip the back seats down and there’s space to slide a bike into the Tipo Station Wagon’s flat load bay, however, and you get a few storage trays either side to stop smaller items rolling about. If you plan to regularly fill your Tipo Station Wagon’s boot and head to the tip, pick a 1.6-litre diesel engine. It’s not quite as smooth as the diesel engines you can get in alternatives but it won’t cost a great deal to run – especially if you do a lot of motorway miles. If you prefer pottering around town to lapping up long journeys, pick one of the two 1.4-litre petrol engines instead. Unfortunately, the Fiat Tipo Station Wagon’s six-speed manual gearbox feels a little notchy to use and the optional automatic unit doesn’t change down with any great urgency when you want to accelerate hard to overtake slow-moving traffic. You’ll hear more wind and tyre noise at speed in the Fiat Tipo Station Wagon than in the Vauxhall Astra Sports Tourer and Ford Focus Estate and you can’t get it with as many advanced safety features, either. That being said, the Fiat Tipo Station Wagon will set you back significantly less than these cars, so it makes a good option if you’re looking for a spacious small car on a fairly tight budget.

The Fiat Panda Cross is a chunky little hatchback that could be your ideal compact off-roader if you fancy something small and easy to drive but live somewhere prone to bouts of harsh winter weather. Unlike the Suzuki Jimny , the Fiat Panda Cross isn’t a thoroughbred 4×4 – as its name suggests, it’s based on the humble Panda hatchback . Peel away the Cross’ angrier bodywork, however, and you’ll find a neat four-wheel-drive system that means it’ll keep up with the Suzuki long after many more expensive SUVs have got themselves well and truly stuck. Its huge plastic bumpers and silver door protectors aren’t just for show, either – they’ll help make sure the Fiat Panda Cross’ bodywork springs back into shape should you have an altercation with a particularly solid piece of the countryside. It even comes with two tow hooks front and back so you can use the Panda’s off-road prowess to rescue other motorists caught in a sudden snowstorm – if you feel like it, that is. This rugged utilitarian theme continues in the Fiat Panda Cross’ cabin – only here it’s less appealing. Sure, the square instruments look pretty funky and the contrasting silver slab and copper-effect dashboard add a splash of colour, but the plastics all feel hard and scratchy and you don’t get a great deal of equipment as standard. So, it might not feel all that plush inside, but at least the Fiat Panda Cross’ cabin is pretty roomy. There’s loads of headroom in the front (although a height-adjustable driver’s seat doesn’t come as standard on entry-level cars) and three kids will have plenty of space to stretch out in the back. A Dacia Duster as more space for tall adults, though, as well as a more practical boot than the diminutive Fiat Panda Cross. The Dacia ’s engines aren’t quite as economical as the Fiat’s, though. You can get the Panda Cross with either a city-friendly 0.9-litre two-cylinder petrol or a more powerful 1.2-litre four-cylinder that’ll be better if you plan on doing long motorway journeys or any kind of serious off-roading. If you plan to stick to the asphalt, though, you’ll find the Fiat Panda Cross feels very similar to the standard Panda – that’s to say it’s a doddle to manoeuvre in town, easy to park and even reasonably comfortable. It’s not particularly spritely – whichever engine you pick – and it leans a fair amount in tight corners, though not enough to make passengers feel ill. What it lacks, though, is any kind of advanced safety kit, such as the automatic emergency braking feature you get in a Suzuki Jimny. That being said, the more affordable Fiat is still a charming compact off-roader that’s well worth a second look.

The Fiat 600 is a bit like a designer handbag you buy because of its stylish looks, but when you get it home you find you can barely fit anything inside. That’s because while the 600’s retro-inspired looks will certainly turn heads, alternatives are much more spacious. And there are alternatives aplenty, from the chic Renault Captur to the rugged Dacia Duster , smart Volkswagen T-Cross and ultra-efficient Toyota Yaris Cross . You could even consider the bigger, plug-in hybrid MG HS , which isn’t a great leap in price. Yet while most of those cars look good in their own way, none is quite as funky as the 600. Sure, it’s not as effortlessly cool as the smaller Fiat 500 , but it’s not a bad effort and wears its curves well. That curvy theme continues inside, with a large oval dashboard that, on the base trim, is painted the same shade as the exterior, which works particularly well if you opt for one of the brighter colours. However, there are cheap materials aplenty, and the floppy cover for the central storage bin is just… odd. Space is pretty good for those in the front though, with plenty of places to store bits and bobs, but that’s where the practicality ends. The rear seats are tight and the boot, at 385 litres is smaller than most alternatives offer. The Captur offers up to a massive 616 litres if you slide the rear seats forward. The infotainment system has sharp enough graphics, but navigating its menus and finding various settings is unintuitive. You can at least bypass most of this with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto , which come as standard – and you’ll need to in the base model, because there’s no built-in navigation. Although Fiat markets the 600 engine as a ‘hybrid’, neither of the two engine choices are a proper self-charging or plug-in unit, so you won’t be cruising around town on electric power watching your MPGs skyrocket. However, it’s very effective at engaging electricity at lower speeds or when decelerating, so it’s relatively efficient – 50mpg is achievable – and smooth to drive around town. If all-electric motoring appeals you might consider the Fiat 600e instead. The diminutive footprint might not be great for space but it does mean the 600 is a doddle to drive in the city, particularly if you’re stepping up from the smaller 500. The suspension handles bumps well even at higher speeds, meaning motorway trips are nothing to fear. It’s anything but exciting to drive, though. Although it’s pretty good value for money already, find out how much you could save with Carwow’s Fiat 600 deals , or check out Fiat 600 leasing deals . You can also browse used Fiat 600s or other used Fiats from our network of trusted dealers, and when it’s time to sell your current car , Carwow can help with that, too. How much is the Fiat 600? How much is the Fiat 600? The Fiat 600 is pretty good value; even the higher-specified La Prima model with the more powerful engine comes in at under £30,000. Standard kit includes 17-inch alloy wheels, LED lights all around and keyless go, but that top-spec trim gets adaptive cruise control , semi-autonomous parking, 360-degree cameras, synthetic leather seats and more. However, if you’re looking to save cash the Renault Captur and Dacia Duster both cost less than the Fiat in their most basic guises. What’s more, you can get proper self-charging hybrid versions starting at the same price as the basic 600, while the all-hybrid Toyota Yaris Cross isn’t much more expensive. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort The Fiat 600 is smooth and economical, but it’s pretty dull The Fiat 600 is ideal for the city, because it’s small and easy to thread down tight streets. And with the electric assistance, stop-start traffic in particular is quiet, with smooth acceleration between red lights. The automatic gearbox is snappy, too, and the light steering is a boon here, while the soft suspension means you barely notice any but the worst potholes. You don’t get much in the way of assistance kit as standard, but step up to the La Prima model and you get all the goodies. Blind spot monitoring, a 360-degree camera, and even a system that will park the car automatically will all be useful for city drivers. Small city cars aren’t normally ideal for big motorway drives, but the Fiat 600 actually performs admirably here. Again, the suspension soaks up bumps well so you get some of the refinement of a big car, though there’s quite a bit of wind and road noise. Power is adequate, but you’ll want the more powerful of the two engines if you spend a lot of time on the motorway. It gets up to speed a bit quicker, though neither engine will make particularly light work of overtakes. All cars get basic cruise control, but top-spec models come with an adaptive system, which can maintain your speed and distance to the car ahead, as well as making sure you don’t drift out of your lane. The ‘stop and go’ function means the car will crawl in traffic for you, too. Although the Fiat 600 soaks up bumpy B-roads nicely for the most part, the light steering and lack of punch from the engines means there’s not much enjoyment to be had. It’s at its best when you relax into a steady drive and don’t ask too much of the tyres in a bend. None of this is strong criticism, though, as none of the 600’s alternatives are particularly exhilarating on a twisty road. Space and practicality Space and practicality Space and storage up front is fine, but the rear seats are cramped and the boot is small Front seat passengers are fairly well catered for in the Fiat 600. Even taller drivers should be able to get comfortable, and while a little more steering wheel and seat adjustment would be nice, it should be fine for most. The door bins will carry a typical Coke bottle, and it’s neat that you can slide the cup holder divider to cater for different sized containers. Beneath the infotainment screen is a large, covered storage bin, which is useful for chucking anything you want to keep out of sight, and it’s home to a pair of USB slots as well as the 12v socket. Space in the back is less impressive. If you have long legs you will probably find your knees resting on the seat in front, though there’s plenty of headroom at least. Kids will be perfectly happy back here, though fitting three people across the bench is a bit of a squeeze. To be fair, this is a common theme among the 600’s alternatives, though the Duster is pretty roomy in the back. Child seats will fit, but it can be snug if you have a bulky seat, and the person in front might have to move their seat forward to make space, which can get a bit cosy. Storage is virtually non-existent, though you do get a USB-C slot for those in the back to fight over. The lack of practicality continues in the boot. The Fiat 600 has 385 litres, which is worse than pretty much every other similarly priced SUV, except for the Vauxhall Mokka’s 350 litres. The Renault Captur is palatial by comparison, at 484 litres as standard. However, the rear seats can be pushed forward to open up a massive 616 litres of space. A Dacia Duster also impresses with 472 litres, while the Volkswagen T-Cross has between 385 and 455 litres, depending on how far you slide the rear seats. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories The interior design is funky in places, but there are plenty of cheap materials and the infotainment system is a bit rubbish Smart and sophisticated the Fiat 600’s interior is not, but in an age of sleek minimalism and screen-heavy cabins it’s actually a breath of fresh air. There’s a large oval-shaped dashboard that’s painted the same colour as the exterior on the basic model, which looks particularly fun in one of the brighter shades, though all La Prima versions come with an ivory interior. The synthetic leather upholstery of the La Prima model is soft and comfortable for big miles, and both this and entry-level car’s fabric seats have the Fiat logo stitched into them, which creates a fun effect. However, that’s about where the positivity ends, because there are a lot of cheap plastics to be found inside – again, not uncommon at this price, but the Renault Captur feels posher and the Dacia Duster wears its ruggedness better. The infotainment system can be incredibly frustrating to use, and you don’t even get navigation built-in as standard. Fortunately that’s not a huge problem, with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto fitted as standard. The fabric seats of the entry-level 600 are heated in the front, but you need to step up to La Prima for basic luxuries such as electric driver’s seat adjustment and automatic climate control. Top-spec cars get a wireless smartphone charging pad, too. MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax There are two engine options available in the Fiat 600. Both are based on a 1.2-litre petrol engine with mild hybrid assistance and come with a six-speed automatic gearbox, but you get a choice of 100hp or 136hp. Official fuel consumption figures are identical for both, at 57.7-58.9mpg. The higher-powered version is the pick of the pair, because it’s no less efficient around town but is better-suited to high speed runs on the motorway or country roads. It’s a bit more expensive to buy, though, at which point you could look at the ultra-efficient Toyota Yaris Cross with its proper hybrid engine, which can easily beat 60mpg in real world driving. Both engines face low first-year Vehicle Excise Duty charges, but if you’re a company car driver and want to save even more in Benefit-in-Kind , you should consider the all-electric Fiat 600e (or any other similarly priced electric cars , for that matter.) Safety and security Safety and security Although the Fiat 600 has not been safety tested by Euro NCAP, models that share its mechanical underpinnings have not performed particularly well. The Jeep Avenger scored just three stars out of five, while the likes of the Vauxhall Mokka and Peugeot 2008 scored four. Standard assistance kit includes all the basics, such as lane-keeping and autonomous emergency braking, but you have to step up to the La Prima model to upgrade the basic cruise control to the adaptive system. These models also get blind spot detection as well as a self parking system and 360-degree cameras. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems Fiat doesn’t have a fantastic reputation for reliability, so it’s perhaps unsurprising that it came 31st out of 32 manufacturers in the latest Driver Power ownership survey. The Fiat 600 comes with a three-year, unlimited mileage warranty, aligning with the common industry offering, though alternatives such as Dacia and MG offer more."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/fiat/500l,Fiat 500L Review and Prices,"€22,216",4/10,new,"The 500L is Fiat’s attempt at injecting a little style and character into the small multi-purpose vehicle (MPV) market, and it would certainly stand out parked between the equivalent Ford or Vauxhall. The 500L itself is actually based on the Fiat Punto, and is aimed at customers who find the idea of a 500 appealing, but need more space. The 500L looks like a Fiat 500 with a pie addiction It’s certainly a practical choice, but reviews are mixed when it comes to deciding whether it’s worth the money or not."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/fiat/600e,Fiat 600e Review & Prices,"€35,726",7/10,new,"Is the Fiat 600e a good car? Is the Fiat 600e a good car? The Fiat 500e is a great city car, but what if you need a bit more space? Step forward the Fiat 600e - the Italian firm’s small, fully-electric SUV . It captures some of the charm and style that’s made the 500 so popular, but stretches it across a bigger body with much more interior room and - importantly - five doors. Think of it like the 500’s older sibling. It’s not quite as cute to look at as the baby of the family, and might not get as much attention - but it’s a lot more useful when you need a helping hand. The 600e may be bigger than the 500 but it’s still pretty small by SUV standards. Compared with alternatives such as the Peugeot e-2008 , MG ZS EV or Carwow Car of the Year-winning Volvo EX30 , it’s quite a bit smaller. It’s more like a jacked-up hatchback, having a similar footprint but higher roofline than cars such as the Vauxhall Corsa Electric . Those tiny dimensions mean the 600e is fantastic for driving and parking in cramped towns and cities, and if you’re upgrading from a 500 it won’t feel intimidating or too bulky. Despite this, interior space is pretty good. The front seats have loads of room, and while the back seats are a bit too cramped for adults to get very comfortable they’re plenty spacious enough for a couple of child seats. Fiat 600e: electric range, battery and charging data Range: 254 miles Efficiency: 4.7mi/kWh Battery size: 54kWh Max charge speed: 100kW Charge time AC: 7hrs 45 mins, 7kW Charge time DC: 27 mins, 20-80%, 100kW Charge port location: Rear left Power outputs: 154hp You do pay for that with the boot space, however, which at 360 litres is larger than most electric hatchbacks but smaller than just about every other comparable electric SUV. Inside, there’s quite a lot to like. The 600e shares many of its components with its close sibling, the Jeep Avenger Electric , but adds in a dose of Italian style familiar to those who’ve sat in a 500. There’s a swooping shape to the dashboard and some shiny trim, plus a pleasing round housing over the instrument cluster. It’s quite a trim-dependent interior, though, with posh La Prima cars getting light-coloured upholstery and trim that really lifts the cabin - while the darker trim of entry-level cars looks and feels a little cheap. There’s plenty of storage space with big door bins and adjustable cupholders, but the fabric flap that covers the central storage bin is just plain annoying. The infotainment system is Fiat’s latest, and it’s based on a very wide but quite shallow display. It can be a bit awkward to use, and a little jerky to flick between menus - but the screen itself is high-res and the wireless smartphone connectivity works perfectly well, allowing you to bypass Fiat’s own system if you want to. There’s also a nice set of physical climate controls, which is much easier to operate on the move than having to head into a display sub-menu just to adjust the temperature. On the road, the 600e is genuinely impressive especially considering its price. It soaks up bumps as well as any of its alternatives, and can make some much more expensive cars feel positively uncomfortable in comparison. Dealing effortlessly with speed bumps and bad roads, plus super-light steering and good visibility means the Fiat 600e is a fantastic EV to drive around town. It’s comfortable on longer trips, too, though it doesn’t feel quite as stable and tied down as some alternatives and there’s a bit more noise on the motorway. The 600e is available with just one motor and battery option at the moment. It officially offers 254 miles of range from a pretty modest battery capacity, and in our tests it proved impressively efficient - resulting in a real-world range of about 200 miles. Public charging from 20-80% takes less than half an hour, which is par for the course. If you’re not ready to make the switch to electric just yet, there's also a hybrid 600. So the Fiat 600e is a decent small electric SUV overall – it’s a bit cheap inside and not hugely practical, but it’s packed full of character and is comfortable to drive around town. It’s priced temptingly, too. Interested? Check out the latest Fiat 600e deals available through Carwow.

How much is the Fiat 600e? How much is the Fiat 600e? The Fiat 600e starts at just under £33,000, which already makes it one of the more affordable electric SUVs. However, Fiat is currently offering a grant on its EVs to make them more tempting, dropping the price just below £30,000. That makes the 600e great value, with the MG ZS EV the only electric SUV that can match it, while the MG4 – which is a hatchback but a similar size to the Fiat – starts at a bit less. Otherwise the closest alternative is the Citroen e-C4, which starts around £32,000, while everything else hovers around the £35,000 mark. Even the top-spec 600e is around £34,000 with the grant, compared with £40,000-plus for the likes of the Peugeot E-2008 and Vauxhall Mokka Electric. There are just two trims, opening with Red models that have 16-inch steel wheels, fabric seat upholstery, cruise control and the infotainment touchscreen with a digital instrument display ahead of the driver. Upgrade to La Prima and you get more paint options, 18-inch alloy wheels, synthetic leather seats and adaptive cruise control . Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort Soft suspension and light steering make the Fiat 600e easy to drive around town, but it’s a bit noisy on the motorway The Fiat 600e is most at home being driven around the city. The suspension soaks up bumps really well, so you barely notice road imperfections as they pass by. You also get light steering to make tight manoeuvres a breeze and visibility is pretty good all around the car. Unlike many electric cars, the 600e doesn’t pull away very quickly from a standstill, so it can be a bit tricky to nip out of busy junctions. However, once you’re on the move it’s more than quick enough. You can put the car into an ‘eco’ mode if you want to maximise range, but this does limit power quite a bit and makes the car feel rather sluggish. You don’t get much assistance kit as standard, but upgrading to the La Prima trim adds parking sensors all around and a reversing camera. Out on the motorway the Fiat 600e is comfortable to drive, soaking up bumps well, while the comfortable seats mean you should feel fresh after a long drive. However, it’s quite noisy once you’re up to speed, with noticeable roar from the tyres and a subtle whistle around the wing mirrors. Once you’re on the move you generally won’t notice any lack of power from the motors, so you can pull off overtakes without too much planning ahead. Standard-fit cruise control is a nice touch, though upgrading to La Prima adds blind spot detection as well as an adaptive system that can maintain your distance to the car in front as well as nudge the wheel to keep you centred in your lane . Twisty roads are where the Fiat 600e is at its least enjoyable. Even if you engage the ‘sport’ mode, the steering is so light that it’s difficult to judge your inputs and make smooth, fast progress through a corner. It’s a similar story with the Volvo EX30, but that car’s sport mode makes the steering more natural and therefore more fun to point down a curvy road. The 600e also struggles with the uneven road surfaces and larger undulations you often get on country roads. While the soft suspension deals well with sharp bumps around town, larger yumps and bumps cause the car to wobble about a lot, so it can feel like you’re being chucked side to side on particularly poor stretches. Space and practicality Space and practicality Space is generally decent in the Fiat 600e’s cabin, but alternatives offer more boot space Front seat passengers will be the happiest of those travelling in the Fiat 600e. It’s not exactly cavernous, but it is roomy enough that even taller drivers won’t feel the need to take a deep breath before folding themselves into the seats. There’s a fairly good range of adjustability in the steering wheel and seat, and you feel like you sit quite high with a good view out over the bonnet. Storage is decent enough, with door bins that will hold a 500ml bottle, though nothing bigger, while there’s a pair of cupholders between the front seats with movable slats for different sizes of container, which is useful. What’s less useful is the half-size glovebox, which you can’t fit much in. There’s also a large bin beneath the drive buttons that has two USB slots and a 12V socket, though it’s covered by an odd flap that’s really awkward to use with one hand. The Fiat 600e is quite a small car, so space in the back seats isn’t huge. However, there’s just about enough room for a six-footer to sit behind another six-footer, though your knees will probably rest on the seat in front. There’s plenty of headroom too, though three passengers would be a real squeeze. There’s foot space for three, but the central seat isn’t comfortable or very wide, so you’ll be shoulder-to-shoulder with the passengers on either side. Storage is virtually non-existent, with no door bins and only pockets in the back of the seat in front to put anything. You do get a USB-C slot, though. There’s space for a child seat, and the ISOFIX mounting points are easy to access behind zips in the seat upholstery. However, particularly bulky seats will require the seat in front to be pushed forward, which can make it really uncomfortable for your passenger. With all that said, you’ll find rear seat space tight in pretty much all of the alternatives to the 600e. If you need room in the back, an MG4 could be your best bet, or if your budget can stretch to it, the Hyundai Kona Electric is very roomy. The Fiat 600e has a 360-litre boot with all the seats in place. That’s on the small side, with the Peugeot E-2008 and MG ZS EV having the biggest boots here at 435 and 480 litres respectively. The Fiat does have more space than the 310 litres in the Vauxhall Mokka Electric and 318 litres in the Volvo EX30, though. Accessing the boot is easy with a fairly low bumper and very minimal lip to lift items over. There are a couple of hooks to stop bags rolling around as you drive, and you can lift the floor to reveal a shallow area that’s useful for storing charging cables. Folding the rear seats opens 1,231 litres, which puts it in the middle of the pack among alternatives and actually outperforms the MG ZS EV. With the seats folded there’s only a slight slope so it’s easy to push big, heavy items in. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories You get comfy seats in the Fiat 600e, but the rest of the interior feels a bit cheap Although the Fiat 600e has a characterful design inside and out, it’s inside where you start to see where the cost-cutting appears to have been made. Some of the materials, such as on the doors of the La Prima model, have an interesting texture, but pretty much everything else is either shiny or scratchy plastic. The synthetic leather seat upholstery is soft and comfortable though, and both this and the entry-level model’s fabric seats have a cool Fiat logo design in the cushions. Tech doesn’t do much to elevate the interior ambience either, and actually feels a bit old school. The main infotainment display is a 10.25-inch touchscreen that’s tiny compared with most alternatives. The menu design is simple but the screen is quite laggy to respond to your touch, and you have to use a physical button below the screen to get back to the home display each time. It’s a bit clunky switching between the two, though if you use Apple CarPlay or Android Auto it works more smoothly. There’s also a 7.0-inch digital instrument display behind the wheel, and although it’s clear and displays all the basic information you need, it looks a little lost in the circular housing. The presence of those chunky buttons is generally a good thing, though. The climate settings are controlled through a bank of switches beneath the screen and they’re super-easy to use on the move, while the steering wheel buttons are intuitive to learn so you can make changes without glancing down at all. There’s a driver assistance shortcut button too, which is useful if you want to quickly turn off any intrusive aids. Electric range, charging and tax Electric range, charging and tax There’s just the one battery and motor combination available with the Fiat 600e. You get a 154hp electric motor that’s good for a 0-60mph time of 9.0 seconds, which reflects the leisurely rate at which it accelerates out on the road. The official range from the 54kWh battery is 254 miles, and this is similar to electric alternatives you might consider at this price. It’s also usefully more than the 214 miles you get on the entry-level Volvo EX30. Our test indicated a real-world range of around 200 miles is likely to be more realistic. Charge speeds are decent, with public charging up to 100kW allowing you to go from 20-80% charge in 27 minutes. The Fiat 600e also comes with AC home charging up to 11kW, which not many alternatives offer, and would let you completely refill the battery in less than six hours. (Though most homes can only charge up to 7kW.) Because it’s a zero-emission vehicle, the Fiat 600e benefits from not having any Vehicle Excise Duty to pay until 2025, while company car drivers get rock-bottom benefit-in-kind rates. Safety and security Safety and security The Fiat 600e has not yet been through safety testing with Euro NCAP yet, and the only other Fiat model to be rated in recent years is the 500e, so it’s difficult to speculate whether this new model will get a similar four-out-of-five rating. What we do know is that the 600e only comes with some of the more basic assistance kit, such as automatic emergency braking and lane departure warning, as standard. Upgrading to La Prima models adds blind spot detection and adaptive cruise control with lane centring. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems Fiat’s reputation for reliability isn’t fantastic, and the petrol-powered 500 hatchback is known for having quite a few problems. Things seem to be a bit better with the 500 Electric, which might offer some reassurance for the 600e. The standard warranty is three years with unlimited mileage, which is similar to what most car makers offer, though some do put mileage limits in place. Both the MG ZS and MG4 come with a hugely impressive seven-year/80,000-mile warranty, though."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/renault/clio,Renault Clio Review & Prices,"€25,793",9/10,new,"Is the Renault Clio a good car? Is the Renault Clio a good car? If you’re looking for an affordable city car, but don’t want to sacrifice on style and practicality, the Renault Clio is an excellent option. It looks great inside and out and has a bigger boot than any of its small hatchback alternatives – so it’s good looking and practical, like a supermodel wearing cargo pants. And a little nip and tuck for 2023 means it looks better than ever, with similar chic appeal to the Peugeot 208 , making the pair stand out from the likes of the Ford Fiesta , Volkswagen Polo and Vauxhall Corsa . But it's so much cheaper than the 208 that it represents fantastic value - earning it a Highly Commended spot in the Smart Spender category of the 2025 Carwow Car of the Year Awards . It’s up front where it’s really eye-catching now, with slim headlights and funky vertical daytime running lights flanking a new grille and prominent Renault logo. Round the back the new look is less obvious, but a tweaked bumper helps make the Clio look much more interesting. It’s a similar story inside, with the profile-orientated infotainment display (on top-spec models) and new climate control buttons giving off a more premium feel than before. And while some scratchy plastics lower in the cabin betray the car’s price, there are plenty of soft surfaces that are suitably upmarket. For a small car , it’s not at all cramped in the front, but those in the back will struggle for kneeroom in particular. Storage is fine wherever you sit, but you’ll want to leave most things in the cavernous boot – at 391 litres it’s more spacious than any alternatives' boots. A hybrid engine gives the Renault a head start on other options, too. The Honda Jazz and Toyota Yaris are just about your only other choices for small car electrification. There’s a regular petrol engine in the Clio too, which brings the price down and is appealing for those on a budget. Out on the road the hybrid works well, with the electric motor offering instant response at lower speeds and helping to keep fuel costs low. The petrol engine can get a bit noisy when accelerating up to motorway speeds, but settles down nicely once you get there. That said, the Volkswagen Polo is a quieter and more refined small car to drive. There’s a bit more tyre roar at high speeds in the Clio, and it’s more easily ruffled by bumps in the road. It shouldn’t be enough to put you off though, and with its appealing mix of style and practicality, the Renault Clio is a car you can shortlist with your heart as well as your head – especially considering it’s also one of the more affordable options. See how much you could save by browsing Renault Clio deals on Carwow, or get a great price on a used Clio . You can also browse other used Renaults , and if you want to sell your car online , Carwow can help with that, too. How much is the Renault Clio? How much is the Renault Clio? The Renault Clio is really good value; its smart looks make it look like a premium option, but it’s actually one of the most affordable small cars you can buy. In fact, in its most basic trim and non-hybrid engine, it costs a bit less than anything else here. The Ford Fiesta, Peugeot 208 and Vauxhall Corsa are closely matched for price though, while you’ll have to shell out a bit more for the proper premium image that comes with the Volkswagen Polo and Audi A1 . Both Clio engines are available with all three trim levels, but the hybrid is £3,500 extra, so you will have to decide if it’s worth it for the extra performance and automatic gearbox. Even high-mileage drivers would be unlikely to see enough of a fuel cost saving to justify it on efficiency grounds alone. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort The Renault Clio is perfectly pleasant to drive, but doesn’t stand-out in any area – others are more comfortable or more fun The Renault Clio’s compact size makes it pretty easy to drive in town. The pillars beside the windscreen aren’t particularly wide so you get a good view out at junctions and the light steering means your arms won’t tire if you need to make a three-point turn or squeeze into a parallel parking space. Despite the extra cost, the hybrid is the more sensible option if you spend most of your time driving around town. The electric motors mean it’s more quiet and more efficient, and the automatic gearbox means you’re not constantly pumping the clutch in rush hour traffic. Unfortunately, it isn’t all good news when you are in the city. The Renault Clio is not stiff like a sports car , but it’s unsettled by bumps a bit more than the most comfortable small hatchbacks, particularly the Volkswagen Polo. On top of this, the Clio’s rather small rear windows, narrow rear windscreen and tall back-seat headrests limit rearward visibility. You can get a rear-view camera system to help when parking, but it’s such low quality it could have been recycled from an early camera phone, so squeezing into a narrow space is still more stressful than in the likes of a Polo or Skoda Fabia . The motorway isn’t the Renault Clio’s natural habitat. It’s fine for the occasional motorway jaunt, but it can’t quite match the higher-speed and long-distance refinement of cars such as the Volkswagen Polo, which drives like a big car in a small car’s body. The main issue is the slightly firm suspension. Although it does settle down at speed, there is still fidgeting over expansion gaps and concrete sections of road. Even on the smoothest surface you’ll notice a surprising amount of wind and tyre noise too. To make things better, you do get cruise control as standard, though you’ll have to get the top-spec Esprit Alpine model for the adaptive tech, which can maintain your distance to the car in front. The more powerful hybrid is naturally more relaxed at speed than the petrol, and it will even shut off the engine to save fuel if the power isn’t needed – such as on a downhill stretch. The firm suspension that proves a minor irritation on broken city road surfaces and motorways should make the Renault Clio feel sportier than most hatchbacks on a twisty country road. To an extent, it does. The Clio’s body barely leans in tight corners and it has plenty of grip when you’re sweeping from one bend to another, but the light steering and notchy manual gearbox in the petrol version mean it’s never as much fun as a Ford Fiesta. With the extra power on offer, the hybrid is more likely to put a smile on your face, but the petrol engine sounds harsh under acceleration and runs out of puff fairly quickly, so it’s far from exciting. Space and practicality Space and practicality The Renault Clio’s front seats are spacious and it has one of the biggest boots of any small hatchback, but this roominess comes at the expense of back-seat space The Renault Clio isn’t a large car, but there’s still space inside for you to get comfortable. There’s a decent amount of headroom, plenty of space for your knees and the steering wheel has a lot of adjustment for height and reach, so even if you’re tall you can get comfortable – not always a given in cars this size. There’s enough storage for most of your family’s bits and pieces, with door bins that can take a large water bottle, a couple of useful cupholders, and under-armrest storage that’s pretty deep if a touch narrow. There’s a tray in front of the gear lever with space for your phone and wireless charging is included on all but the entry-level trim. The glovebox is big enough to hold a small handbag too, and there’s a storage tray for sunglasses up by the rear-view mirror. Space in the back isn’t quite as generous as the front. The back doors open almost at right angles to the rest of the car to help access but they’re very narrow, which makes getting in a little tricky. There’s room for passengers to push their feet under the seats in front, even in their lowest setting, but there isn’t a great deal of knee or headroom so those over six feet tall will struggle to get comfortable. The Clio’s cabin isn’t quite as wide as that in a Volkswagen Polo, so you’ll struggle to carry three adults in the back at once – a problem not helped by the narrow central seat with its raised cushion. There’s just about enough space for three kids, even if some of them require a booster cushion. Fitting a bulky rear-facing child seat is more difficult, however, because there isn’t much space to lift it through the rear doors and twist it into position. At least the ISOFIX anchor points are easy to access behind some plastic caps. Storage in the back seats isn't quite as good as in the front – you don’t even get a folding central armrest or a set of cupholders – but at least the rear door bins are wide enough to hold a one-litre bottle each. If you need a small car that maximises boot space, the Renault Clio is the car for you. However it’s important to note that you get less space in the hybrid – 301 litres compared with 391 litres in the petrol. That makes the non-hybrid version the most practical small car, with a bigger boot than the Volkswagen Polo (351 litres), Audi A1 (335 litres) and Peugeot 208 (311 litres). If you go for the hybrid it’s one of the smallest, offering similar capacity to the Ford Fiesta’s 303 litres. Despite the fact that there’s loads of space, it’s not the easiest to access. The bumper is quite high, as is the lip into the boot, so if you have heavy items they can be tricky to lift in and out. The boot floor is quite low too, so you have to reach in somewhat. If you need more space, there’s just over 1,000 litres if you fold the rear seats. There’s a 60/40 split, so you can have someone sit in the back while also opening a bit more space for storage. However, with the seats down there’s quite a prominent ridge in the floor, so it’s not easy to push large items through. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories The Renault Clio’s interior looks and feels just as posh as in some more expensive German alternatives, but its infotainment system isn’t the easiest to use The Renault Clio interior looks like it belongs in a posh saloon rather than a cheap-and-cheerful hatchback. The sweeping dashboard, with its two-tone colour scheme, neatly integrated air vents and metal-effect knobs and dials, is a far cry from the awkward, cheap-looking design you got in older versions of the Clio. It doesn’t just look like a premium product, the new Renault Clio feels impressively posh, too. The dashboard and centre console come with swathes of soft plastic trims that feel just as upmarket as those in the more expensive VW Polo. Only the door cards feel a little scratchy. Top-spec Esprit Alpine models look the fanciest thanks to the 9.3-inch infotainment display, with the two lower trims getting a 7.0-inch screen that’s a touch more old-school. Whichever you go for, the software is a bit simple and is quite slow to respond to your inputs. Wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto make things much easier to use. The 7.0-inch instrument display is decent, and it’s easy to switch between menus to display the information you need. However, it’s not a patch on the excellent setups in the Volkswagen Polo and Audi A1. MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax The engine line-up is really simple, with just two to choose from. The cheaper option is a 1.0-litre petrol, and it has a rather paltry 90hp that means it gets from 0-62mph in a leisurely 12.2 seconds. If you’re looking for the cheapest Clio and don’t need extra performance it’s fine, but with its manual gearbox it’s not as relaxing to drive around town. That said, official figures suggest it’s capable of up to 54.3mpg, so fuel costs will be low. Speaking of which, the other option is the hybrid, which combines a 1.6-litre petrol engine with an electric motor – it has 145hp and can get up to 67.3mpg. Fuel costs will be a bit lower, the more powerful engine makes it easier to get up to speed, and the automatic gearbox makes inner-city traffic a breeze to deal with. Both are really cheap on road tax , and have similar company car tax rates at 28% for the petrol and 24% for the hybrid. Safety and security Safety and security The Clio earned a five-star Euro NCAP rating, thanks partly to a range of hi-tech driver assistance systems that are more usually seen on bigger and far more expensive models. All models get lane departure warning and lane keep assist , plus traffic sign recognition and cruise control with a speed limiter function. Active Emergency Braking is also featured, including cyclist and pedestrian detection functionality. Upgrade to Esprit Alpine and you get adaptive cruise control, blind spot warning and rear cross traffic alert. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems Like all Renault cars, the Clio is covered by a warranty package with unlimited mileage during the first 24 months, but is then limited to a total of 60,000 miles or three years whichever comes first. That’s fairly typical but not great, particularly compared with the seven-year warranty offered by Kia or the unlimited-mile five-year package from Hyundai. Hopefully you won’t need any repairs, but Renault isn’t traditionally a strong performer in satisfaction and reliability surveys."

The Renault Scenic has been resurrected, and this time it’s ditched the dowdy MPV body in favour of being a chic, modern electric SUV . It’s a bit like when Zac Efron dropped his floppy-haired Disney kid look in favour of the gym-obsessed heartthrob appearance he has today. And chic the Scenic must be to stand out, because there are dozens of similarly sized electric SUVs vying for a spot on your shopping list, such as the Skoda Elroq , Hyundai Ioniq 5 and Peugeot E-3008 . There’s also the excellent Kia EV3 , which is a bit smaller and cheaper, but well worth considering. The quick win goes to the Renault Scenic, because it really does look good. At the rear you get chunky tail lights that drop down at the sides and make the car look really wide, as well as a simple but effective bumper design. Up front there are slim headlights and a fake grille with a cool gradient effect. Range: 260 miles - 379 miles Efficiency: 3.6 - 3.7mi/kWh Battery size: 60kWh / 87kWh Max charge speed: 130kW / 150kW Charge time AC: 9hrs 51mins, 0-100, 7.4kW / 13hrs, 0-100%, 7.4kW Charge time DC: 32mins, 15-80%, 130kW / 37mins, 15-80%, 150kW Charge port location: Right side front Power outputs: 170hp / 220hp The interior isn’t as immediately striking as the exterior, but it has a simple but smart appearance and there are some nice colours and materials for the upholstery, while the infotainment system is slick and easy to use. However, there are plenty of cheap materials to be found. Fortunately this is made up for with practicality, because there’s loads of storage in the cabin, plenty of adjustability in the front seats and steering wheel, and a huge amount of space in the back that also makes it good for a child seat. The boot is a good size too – at 545 litres it’s bigger than most alternatives, including the Skoda Elroq. There’s no front boot like you get in the Hyundai Ioniq 5, either. It might be practical, but out on the road, the Renault Scenic is a touch disappointing to drive. It’s generally quite comfortable, but it can be a bit jiggly over bumps, particularly at lower speeds. Visibility isn’t great either, and the spongy brakes take some getting used to. Now, it’s not so bad in any of these areas that the Scenic is not worth considering, it just doesn’t really stand out in any area either. For day-to-day comfort, the Hyundai Ioniq 5 is tough to beat. There are two battery and motor combinations, with the entry level version offering a respectable range of 260 miles, while the larger (more expensive) battery can go up to 379 miles between charges, according to official figures – that makes it one of the longest-range electric cars on sale.

How much is the Renault Scenic E-Tech? How much is the Renault Scenic E-Tech? If you’re looking for pure value from your electric car , a Renault Scenic in entry-level Techno trim is a good place to start, because at about £37,500 it undercuts most alternatives comfortably. This does get you the lower-powered, smaller battery model, though it still has a respectable range. The Kia EV3 undercuts the Scenic on price, but then it is a slightly smaller car. The entry trim is also available with the big battery and more powerful motor, with prices starting at £41,000. It’s about £43,500 for the mid-spec Esprit Alpine trim and £45,500 for top-spec Iconic models. The smaller battery might be the best value, but even big battery versions are well-priced against alternatives. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort The Renault Scenic is generally comfortable to drive and promises impressive range, but it’s not the most intuitive car to drive and visibility is poor Town driving is where the Renault Scenic is at its best, because the electric motors are quiet and punchy, and you get relaxing sounds through the speakers as you drive about. It’s comfortable over big bumps too, though smaller road imperfections can make the car jitter a bit, which can get annoying in areas with particularly poor Tarmac. The main problem is that it’s difficult to be smooth on the brakes, because the first part of the pedal is really spongy and doesn’t do much, then suddenly you get loads of braking and jerk to a stop. Visibility is poor too, particularly out of the back with big rear pillars and a small rear window. Front and rear parking sensors come as standard to make reversing into a bay a bit easier, though if you go for top-spec Iconic models, you get a 360-degree parking camera and a hands-free parking system. At higher speeds the Renault Scenic is pretty comfortable and refined enough, which means it’s a good companion for a motorway drive – useful when you have plenty of range from the big battery. The Peugeot E-3008 is a bit better for motorway driving, but there’s not a lot in it. You get adaptive cruise control as standard, which not only maintains your speed to the car in front, but can also slow the car for turns or when you’re approaching a roundabout. All cars get a blind spot warning system too, which is useful when changing lanes with those chunky rear pillars blocking your view. Head out into the countryside and the Renault Scenic is fine, but look elsewhere if you enjoy taking a detour down your favourite B-road on the way home from work. It deals well with bumps and the body doesn’t lean in corners too much, so it feels like you could have some fun. However, much like the brakes, the steering isn’t particularly intuitive, which makes the car tricky to place on the road. It feels like there’s little response when you first turn in, but as you apply more lock you suddenly notice the front tyres turning aggressively. That said, none of the similarly priced alternatives you might consider are particularly thrilling on a twisty road. You’ll have to spend more on a Kia EV6 or Ford Mustang Mach-e if that’s what you're after, or perhaps consider the Cupra Born hatchback. Space and practicality Space and practicality The boot is big and there’s loads of space in the cabin. The boot load lip isn’t ideal, but you need to nitpick to find anything to complain about One of the key selling points of the Renault Scenic is its massively practical interior. There’s loads of room for all the accoutrements of family life. The door bins are a bit narrow but there’s a huge space in the centre console ahead of a single cupholder, with a divider that can be moved to create a second cupholder or more space as desired. It’s a good system but it can be fiddly to slide into place, and it’s a similar story with the armrest. There’s a useful space beneath this, but the two USB-C slots that are built into this area can be tough to access with the armrest in its forward position. Ultimately there’s buckets of storage capacity with a couple of minorly annoying quirks to work around. Finding a comfortable driving position is easy enough because there’s loads of adjustment for both the steering wheel and seat. However, the windscreen is quite narrow, so that largely dictates the best position to sit. It’s similarly roomy in the back, with absolutely miles of legroom to the seats in front and plenty of space above your head, even if you’re tall. Shoulder room is a bit tight for three, but the outer seat cushions rather push you towards the centre, so it can get quite snug if someone’s in the middle. Practicality isn’t a patch on the front seats – the door bins are quite narrow and you do get big pockets on the seats in front, but that’s about it. There are two USB-C slots for charging phones, and small pockets in the top of the front seats for your phone. One cool feature is an armrest with swivelling arms that can hold your phone so you can watch videos easily on the move. If you need to fit a child seat, the Scenic is a great option. The ISOFIX mounting points are easy to access, the doors open really wide and all that kneeroom translates into a big space that’ll fit even the bulkiest of child seats. The Renault Scenic has a good-sized boot when compared with alternatives. At 545 litres, it’s only beaten by the Skoda Enyaq (585 litres) and cavernous but much pricier Tesla Model Y (854 litres). The latter also has a 117-litre front boot, something the Renault goes without. The Hyundai Ioniq 5’s boot is slightly smaller than the Renault’s at 527 litres, but its overall capacity wins when you take the 57-litre front boot into account. The Peugeot E-3008’s boot is some way off at 520 litres. If you’re considering the Kia EV3 or Volvo EX30 , you can get higher-spec models for Scenic money, but it’s important to note that they are smaller cars and have less boot space – 460 litres in the Kia and 318 litres in the Volvo . You can fold the rear seats of the Scenic, but you do so by pulling a ring that’s covered by the seatbelt, so it’s not the easiest. This opens up 1,670 litres of space, which is about average among alternatives, but is let down by a massive ridge where the seats lie so sliding big, heavy items in isn’t easy. When loading the Scenic’s boot, the bumper is quite high and there’s a deep lip, which, again, can make it tricky to lift large, heavy items over. There’s a big under-floor storage area, which is useful for charging cables and lesser-used items that you don’t want to clutter the main boot area or want to keep hidden from view. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories The infotainment system is incredibly quick to respond, but overall interior quality is only so-so While the Renault Scenic’s exterior design has a cool, ultra-modern edge, the same doesn’t quite extend to the interior. It’s not a bad design, rather simple and fuss-free. You get a twin-screen instrument and infotainment setup on a panel that sits proud of the main dashboard. It’s all the rage these days but here it doesn’t look quite as seamlessly integrated as it is elsewhere, and the main screen is a bit low, so you feel like you’re looking a long way from the road when checking the screen. On the plus side, the infotainment system is incredibly quick to use. Usually the best you can hope for is ‘quick for an in-car setup’, but the Scenic’s computers work as rapidly as any iPad. You switch screens the moment you touch an on-screen button, and the next display loads in an instant, with no lag when you drag map screens around, either. That shouldn’t be a big deal these days, but it actually is. Physical climate control buttons are useful, too. The quality of everything around the displays is hit and miss, though. The material on the things you regularly touch is pretty good, with the Esprit Alpine model we tried having nice leather on the armrest and cool colours for the upholstery. But there are also scratchy plastics in easy reach, such as the top of the doors, which can be uncomfortable to rest your arm on for long periods. If your budget can stretch, the Peugeot E-3008 feels a bit posher and has a really cool, modern design. Electric range, charging and tax Electric range, charging and tax There are two battery and motor combinations available for the Scenic. The more affordable option has a 60kWh battery and 170hp electric motor, with the result being a claimed range of up to 260 miles, though this is only available on the entry-level trim. Step up to the larger battery and you get an 87kWh capacity with a 220hp electric motor. This is available on all three trims and provides a range of up to 379 miles, though during our time with the car we saw just 3.1miles per kWh, which would result in a real-world range of about 270 miles. When it’s time to charge, the Scenic can take up to 150kW on a public fast charger with the big battery, which is fine but not great, and it’s 130kW for the smaller battery. The result is both models take just over half an hour to go from 15-80%. In terms of AC charging, the Scenic can take up to 22kW, which is really good but these chargers are few and far between. Most home chargers have a 7.4kW capacity, and in this case it takes the small battery over nine hours to go from 0-100%, and the big battery nearly 13 hours to do the same. First year road tax comes in at £10, with the standard rate applying after then. If you’re a company car buyer, the Scenic has a very low benefit-in-kind rate thanks to being an electric car. Safety and security Safety and security The Renault Scenic scored the full five stars when tested by the safety experts at Euro NCAP . It scored fairly well across the board without standing out in one particular area, though its safety rating was above average. You do get some good assistance kit as standard, including a blind spot monitoring system with an emergency lane-keeping assistant to avoid motorway collisions. Adaptive cruise control is also usefully included on all models. Step up from the base trim and you get a digital rear-view mirror and a surround view camera, with top models getting a hands-free parking system and 360-degree camera. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems Renault ranked particularly poorly in the latest Driver Power owner satisfaction survey. Its position of 28 out of 32 car makers is disappointing, and marks an improvement of just one place compared with the previous year. Renault’s standard warranty is in line with most alternatives, but does hover around the minimum you get from a car manufacturer in the UK at three years or 100,000 miles – though that mileage is unlimited in year one. You get much longer cover from MG , Hyundai and Kia."

Is the Renault Megane E-Tech a good car? If you’re looking for a stylish electric hatchback , the Renault Megane E-Tech is one worth considering. It’s the sort of car to be looking at if you’re considering an electric hatchback such as the Volkswagen ID3 , Cupra Born or MG4 EV . This Megane is like one of your mates who’s suddenly decided to take on a vegan, eco-conscious lifestyle. Gone are its petrol versions, with just electric power coming in its place, plus a bunch of eco-friendly materials. But more on those shortly. There’s no questioning that the Renault Megane E-Tech Electric is a looker. A striking front-end design, sleek roofline and strong selection of two-tone colour choices certainly allow it to stand out. You’ll get 18-inch wheels as standard, but there’s a set of optional 20-inch alloys if those aren’t large enough for you. It’s just as stylish inside, too. You’re met immediately with a two-spoke steering wheel that offers something of a throwback feel (if you look beyond all the buttons), plus a host of recycled fabrics that look and feel the part. You can go for leather on top-spec cars, though. Range: 280 miles Efficiency: 3.9 miles per kWh Battery size: 60kWh Max charge speed: 130kW Charge time AC: 9hrs 11mins, 0-100% at 7kW Charge time DC: 1hr 14mins, 0-80% at 130kW Charge port location: Right front Power outputs: 215hp Directly in your line of vision is a 12.3-inch digital driver’s display that’s crisp and very configurable. To the side of that, you’ll find a portrait-set infotainment system that serves as evidence car manufacturers should bin off developing their own software and leave it to tech companies. This isn’t a dig at Renault, as it uses a new Google-based system here in the Megane. It’s super-sharp, dead easy to use and comes with impressive Google Maps integration without charging you any extra for the privilege. It helps that the assistant for voice controls is easy to use and rarely mishears you, too. However, the Megane is let down a little in the practicality stakes. Its roofline helps the design, but it does mean headroom in the back isn’t great, although there’s a good amount of knee room. The Renault’s boot comes in at a healthy 440 litres, which is comfortably more than the VW ID3’s 385 litres. However, it’s hindered by a massive lip that can make loading difficult — and storing the charging cables under the boot floor will mean playing real-life Tetris every time you want to charge while carrying a full load. The Megane comes with just the one power output, giving a 220hp instant surge of torque. It comes with a 60kWh battery, which offers 292 claimed miles between charges. In other markets there is also a cheaper and lower-powered 130hp version with a choice of battery sizes, but this isn’t offered in the UK. Hook it up to a 130kW rapid charger you’ll be able to complete a full charge in a little over 70 minutes. A 7.4kW home wall box charger will take just over 9 hours. Around town, the Megane’s light and direct steering make zipping around a breeze. That said, massive pillars at the front and a narrow rear window result in pretty poor visibility. You can have a rear-view camera displayed on the mirror to help the latter issue, but it’ll cost you. Take it out on the motorway and its soft-set suspension results in a smooth ride, though this combined with light steering does detract from your ability to have fun on twisty roads. So if you’re looking to add some style and sustainability to your driveway, the Renault Megane E-Tech should have a place on your shortlist. Head on over to our Renault deals page to see how much you can save on a Megane E-Tech when you buy through carwow. You can also save money on other Renaults , or if you’re in the market for a used model instead, we have a marketplace for that as well. If you want to change your car altogether, you can sell your car with our trusted dealers bidding on your car so you can get the best price. How much is the Renault Megane E-Tech? How much is the Renault Megane E-Tech? It’s far from the cheapest electric car on sale but the Megane E-Tech at least offers reasonable value for money. In fact, in its most affordable ‘Equilibre’ specification, it’s actually significantly cheaper than the Volkswagen ID3, although if you want a cheaper ID3 you can just buy a Cupra Born , which has all of the same battery and tech as the Volkswagen, but which is closer to the Renault on price. The fly in the Megane’s ointment is the MG 4 , which even in Long Range form, with a 281-mile range, undercuts the Megane by several thousand pounds. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort The Renault Megane E-Tech’s greatest asset is its comfort — it’s exceptionally refined and smooth to drive. It can also corner with enthusiasm, but can’t quite match the MG 4 or Cupra Born for a B road blast The Megane has brake energy recovery — which slows you down by using the drag of the electric motor — that you can adjust with paddles behind the steering wheel. Set it for maximum braking, and you get useful one-pedal driving around town but you still need to use the physical brakes to come to a complete stop, and they do feel a bit over-sensitive and snatchy. The Megane has a very tight 10.4-metre turning circle, which makes it super-manoeuvrable in town, and that combined with the light steering makes mini-roundabouts and u-turns a doddle. The downside is visibility — you get a good forward view, and good door mirrors, but the rear window is a proper letter-box, and you’re not going to be able to see much behind you. The rear windscreen wiper also only clears a tiny semi-circle of the screen. It’s not helped by chunky rear roof pillars so there’s a massive blind spot when pulling out of angled junctions. The Megane is quite light for an electric car — around 1,700kg — which means its suspension isn’t too overwhelmed, so the ride around town, although quite taut, isn’t too firm and actually feels quite sophisticated. The 220hp motor means that it’s easy to pile on the speed from 40mph upwards when joining a fast-flowing motorway, although you might feel a little tug on the steering when you give it full power. It’s a quiet cruiser at 70mph too, thanks to Renault doing a lot of work to keep wind and road noise down, but there is a distinct rumbling noise from the airflow under the car. At motorway speeds, your range will probably drop to around 200 miles, incidentally. On a country road, it’s best to have the brake regeneration in its middle setting, which helps you to balance the Megane as you turn into a corner. The whole car feels really natural and at home when you point it down a twisty road. It has a good balance between comfort and precision, and the steering encourages you to have a little fun as you go — it’s responsive and accurate, and you can make it a little heavier by turning on Sport mode. The electric motor responds more quickly when you switch on Sport too, a bit too much so as the response can be too sudden, and a touch ‘flighty’ so Comfort is the best setting. The Megane is front-wheel drive, so it doesn’t feel quite as sharp on a twisting road as the rear-wheel drive likes of the MG 4 or Cupra Born. Space and practicality Space and practicality The Megane has a large boot, but rear space isn’t as good as it should be The front of the Megane’s cabin is reasonably spacious and has useful storage areas, but the storage box under the armrest is a bit small, and the placement of the USB sockets in front of the armrest, in their own little cubby-hole, is kind of awkward. There’s a huge open storage area down by your feet though, which has moveable cup holders, or you could take the cup holders out entirely and fill that space with a laptop bag. There’s a little shelf just below the infotainment screen, which is home to the wireless phone charger if you’ve specced the car with one, but which is a bit too small to be useful for anything else. The glovebox is adequate, but no more than that, although the door bins — lined with felt so that loose items don’t rattle — are big, and can hold a two-litre bottle of water (or fizzy drink, if you’re feeling frisky). The driving position is good, with lots of adjustment, and if the steering wheel is a slightly odd, square-ish shape (cough, Austin Allegro, cough) then at least it feels good to hold. Knee room in the Megane’s back seats is pretty good, although not quite as generous as you get in the Volkswagen ID3 or Cupra Born. Headroom is a little tight, as the Megane’s roof sweeps down so much, but it’s enough to be getting on with. The problem in the back is space for your feet — the front seats are set low down, so there’s nowhere for rear seat passengers to poke their toes. Better leave the hiking boots at home and wear ballet slippers… The low-mounted rear seat also means that taller passengers won’t have good under-thigh support. The Megane is too narrow to get three full-size adults comfy in the back, as the centre seat is too small and the roofline curves inwards, meaning that those in the outer seats have to lean their heads. Oddly, there are roof-mounted grab handles for rear seat passengers, but not for the front-seat passenger. You do at least get ISOFIX points in the two outer rear seats, and in the front passenger seat. The rear anchors have flip-up covers, which makes them really easy to use and you do get good door bins and map pockets in the seatbacks. You will have to do without a rear armrest though, and only higher-spec models get rear USB sockets. Oh, and the rear windows don’t wind down fully. If you want an EV that’s more practical in the back, look at a Kia Niro EV. There’s a tiny little button built into the boot-lid that opens up the rear, but the boot itself is not tiny — at 440 litres, it has more space than the VW ID3, the MG 4, or the Cupra Born, which sit at 385, 363 and 385 litres respectively. Only the Kia Niro has a bigger boot in this class. There’s a problem though, which is that the boot is deep, rather than long or wide, so it’s not so good for carrying bulky single items. Meanwhile, the load lip is huge, so bigger items will have to be (carefully, now) heaved in over that. Helpfully, though, there is a little storage area under the boot floor which allows you to stash your charging cable, However, the Megane doesn’t have an adjustable boot floor, which means when you fold down the back seats, there’s a massive lip over which heavier items have to be levered, and nor has Renault fitted clips to prevent the rear seatbelts getting trapped when you pop the seats back upright again. There’s also no load-through ‘ski hatch’, or any extra boot under the bonnet (a ‘frunk’ or, if you prefer, a ‘froot’) to compensate. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories The Megane’s cabin gets some proper high-tech, courtesy of Google, but beware of the quantity of buttons and switches around the steering wheel, as it’s not the most user-friendly of layouts The Megane’s interior looks every bit as handsome as the outside, and that starts with the twin-screen dashboard layout. Unlike some other cars with digital screens, Renault doesn’t try to pretend that the infotainment screen and the instrument panel are one big screen. In fact, the two screens are actually separated by an extra air-vent. For the most part, the cabin looks and feels expensive, especially the attractive fabric finish to the top of the dashboard, but you will find cheaper, scratchy plastic on the tops of the doors and around the lower reaches of the interior. In European markets, the central touchscreen can be upgraded to a big, almost-Tesla-style, portrait type screen, but here in the UK we must make do with a standard, square-ish nine-inch setup. It’s fine, if not quite as visually impressive, but the good thing is that Renault has farmed out the development of the screen’s software to Google, so you get some useful tech included. There’s Google Assistant (you can shout ‘Hey, Google’ at the dashboard and ask for all sorts of functions), Google Play store for extra apps, and of course Google Maps. There’s also standard connections for Apple CarPlay and Android Auto so that you can use your phone, both connecting wirelessly. Plus, there’s ambient lighting that you can change yourself, or set it to adjust automatically during the day. You can even change the noise that the parking sensors make and change the volume of the indicator clicks. The 12.3-inch instrument display in front of the driver is excellent, with lots of information and you can change the layout and the colours according to your taste. One annoying thing to note is that the Megane uses a gear selector mounted on the steering column, which saves space on the centre console. That’s fine, but there’s also the column stalk for the wipers back there, as well as a little pod for fingertip stereo controls. Combine that with the little button on the edge of the steering wheel centre that controls Sport mode and you just have too many buttons and levers on one side of the wheel. Mind you, it’s good that you have a little star-marked button on the steering wheel which you can set to switch on or off multiple items, including a setting that turns on both front heated seats at the same time. We also like that you can easily switch the lane-keeping assistance on and off with a button, rather than digging around on the touchscreen. Electric range, charging and tax Electric range, charging and tax With the bigger 60kWh battery pack (the only one Renault UK has on sale at the moment) the Megane E-Tech (not to be confused with the old Megane hybrid, which was also badged as E-Tech) has a maximum claimed range of 281 miles on a charge. In mixed driving conditions, that will probably fall to around 200 or 220 miles, which isn’t particularly brilliant, but the Megane has a bit of a charging ace up its sleeve. On a DC high-powered fast charger, the Megane will charge at up to 130kW, which is enough to get you from around 20 miles of range to around 180 miles in just 30 minutes. That’s good, but not exceptional. What’s better is the slower AC charging. The Megane has a 22kW AC charging system, compared to the 11kW or even 7.5kW of some other electric cars. That means that, from a kerbside public charger, you can potentially top up from half to full battery in under two hours. It’s a real boon when you’re out and about, and saves you potentially queuing for more expensive DC chargers. Being electric, the Megane has zero-rate VED road tax , and will only cost you two per cent in BIK tax if you’re a company car driver. Safety and security Safety and security For the past 20 years, Renault has been racking up big scores from Euro NCAP for crash safety, and the Megane E-Tech is no exception. It gets a full five-star safety rating, although at 85 per cent, its adult occupant protection rating is arguably a little low. Basic models come with a driver drowsiness alert, forward collision alert with emergency braking, cruise control with a speed limiter, a rear-view camera and rear parking sensors, traffic sign recognition, and emergency calling, which rings the emergency services if it detects you’ve had an accident. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems The Megane E-Tech is very new, so we won’t know how truly reliable it is for some time yet, but it uses much of the same battery and motor technology as Renault’s partner, Nissan, uses for the Ariya so the prospects for reliability are good. Renault tends to place about mid-table, as a brand, when it comes to reliability surveys which is OK if not exceptional. All Renaults come with a three-year warranty, which has unlimited mileage for the first two years, but which is limited — to 100,000 miles for electric vehicles — for the third year. The Megane’s battery is separately warrantied for eight years and 100,000 miles. You can also buy an extended warranty, which will cover the car for an additional 12 months, but which is also limited to 100,000 miles."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/renault/zoe,Renault Zoe Review & Prices,"€9,126",8/10,used,"Is the Renault Zoe a good car? Is the Renault Zoe a good car? The Renault Zoe is a small electric car with a decent range that’s an alternative to models such as the Mini E and Peugeot e-208 . The Zoe has been around for a while now, but gets regular updates, so it’s a bit like an iPhone in that it looks mostly unchanged year after year, yet contains the very latest technology. The current model’s latest updates include a few more air intakes than its predecessor – some of which help guide air past the front wheels to help reduce drag and maximise range – and a set of full-LED headlights. Renault has given the Zoe’s brake lights the LED treatment too; ditching the old car’s blue lens coating in the process. More exciting than this, however, is what lies inside. There’s a super-slick dashboard layout, a classy infotainment system and a digital driver’s display as standard. You can even get the dashboard trimmed in some whale-friendly recycled material made from old plastic bottles. Thankfully, the Renault Zoe is really comfortable inside – in the front, at least. Those in the back will feel pretty hemmed-in if they’re close to six-feet tall and there isn’t enough shoulder room to carry three adults. Chances are, you won’t be using your dinky electric city car for lugging heavy loads. Rather, you’ll be nipping through rush-hour traffic – something the Zoe feels born to do. You get a good view forward thanks to its large windows, and the light controls make tight turns a doddle. The new Renault Zoe is capable of more than just trips to the shops, though. With its batteries fully brimmed – which takes three hours from empty using a public 22kW charger – you’ll be able to travel up to 239 miles. Charging at home using the standard 7 kWh setup will take just over nine hours. However, a 30-minute charge using a 50kW fast charger will give you 90 miles of range. This fast- charging feature is optional on the base trim and standard on the top version. It’s pretty perky for a small car, too, so you’ll have no issue scooting away from junctions or overtaking sluggish lorries. That said, the Renault Zoe doesn’t make a particularly good motorway cruiser. Sure, its electric motor is much quieter than a petrol or diesel engine, but you’ll still hear a fair amount of wind and tyre noise at speed. You do at least get cruise control to make long journeys a bit more bearable. Another point to consider is the rather poor Euro NCAP retested safety rating it received in 2021. You shouldn’t let this put you off, though. The Renault Zoe is a very capable small electric car that comes with decent range and peppy performance, and recent updates mean you get a pretty impressive amount of standard kit, too. Just don’t go trying to carry tall adults in the back. Head over to our Renault Zoe deals page to see how much you can save or take a look at our used Renault Zoe deals . How much is the Renault Zoe? How much is the Renault Zoe? The Renault Zoe is priced very closely to alternatives like the Peugeot e-208, Nissan Leaf and Mini Electric. It may be one of the smaller electric city cars out there, but its value proposition has increased thanks to its superb range and the dropping of the less powerful base trim. As it stands, the top Iconic trim is the pick of the range and matches up well to other small EVs. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort The Zoe is great to drive around town, it’s also a hoot down a country lane. Wind and road noise levels aren’t the best once heading out onto the motorway, though The compact Renault Zoe is well suited to the rigours of city driving. Great forward visibility, immediate responsiveness and a sharp turning circle give you the confidence to take advantage of even the smallest gaps in the traffic. Acceleration is smooth and effortless, though in typical electric car fashion, the brakes can feel a bit sharp until you get used to them, and the regenerative braking is also quite abrupt until you adapt your driving style to it. The view out the rear isn’t great thanks to rather large pillars and a narrow rear window, thankfully Renault’s Easy Park Assist is now standard fitment. It’ll steer the car into tight bays for you, and parking sensors and a rearview camera are standard, too, if you prefer to take matters into your own hands. The Zoe also comes standard with blind spot warning and slow speed pedestrian warning, which is useful to have around town. The ride quality is good over smaller bumps, but the Zoe can get caught out when traversing badly rutted roads, where it transmits unpleasant bumps and thumps into the cabin. Now that the more powerful 135hp is standard fare, the Zoe is far more capable at motorway speeds even in base trim. It feels pleasantly solid and stable, which is not something that can be said for all small cars in this class. Overtaking performance is good too, although you’ll notice that the Zoe starts to run out of puff if you stray over 70mph. Cruise control, lane keep assist and lane departure warning are all standard, great for taking the strain out of longer trips. It’s not all good news though. The Zoe does exhibit a fair amount of wind noise at higher speeds, and while the front seats are comfortable enough for short journeys, taller adults won’t enjoy being seated in the rear for extended spells. Packing the heavy battery pack under the floor gives the Zoe a planted feel around corners, and the responsive steering and impressive low speed acceleration mean that it’s quite good fun to chuck around a twisty road. It doesn’t lean in corners much either, and while a Peugeot e-208 or Mini Electric are even sportier, the Zoe offers a good mix of handling and comfort that should suit a broad range of customers. Space and practicality Space and practicality The Zoe is spacious in front, but rather tight in the back and there’s not a lot of space to store your effects either The Zoe manages to feel bigger than it really is thanks to the large window area and upright driving position. The steering wheel can be adjusted for rake and reach, but the seat height can’t be changed so taller drivers may foul their knees on the steering wheel while shorter people may be seated a bit too low – it’s best to check that you fit comfortably before you buy. Storage space is in short supply in the cabin; the door bins are fine for smaller water bottles but are a bit too narrow for much more. A pair of cupholders are provided between the front seats, but they’re located a bit too far back. The Zoe partially redeems itself with a handy storage shelf above the smallish glovebox, which has a non-slip coating to stop your phone or keys from sliding into your lap. The centre console also offers a storage shelf ahead of the gear lever which offers wireless charging and comes with two USB ports, AUX jack and 12-volt socket for your electronic devices. The rear doors open wide, making it easy to slot a pair of baby seats into the ISOFIX brackets. It’s not particularly spacious, though, and there’s just about enough room for two adults. Taller occupants will be brushing their heads along the roof lining, and knee room is also limited if the front seats are moved too far back. Three kids will fit fine in the rear, although the centre seat is raised and not all that comfortable on longer trips. Two USB ports are provided in the rear, great to keep the kids’ devices charged for those longer trips. The Renault Zoe offers 338 litres of boot space, way more than the 211 litres you get in the Mini Electric and almost twice as much as the 171 litres in the Honda e . The boot lip is low and the load area itself is wide and flat, with some baggage hooks for your shopping and a dedicated spot for the charging cables under the boot floor. The seats fold down to offer up to 1,225 litres of total load space, that’s pretty good for such a small car, although the load area is not completely flat. If you need more space, you’ll need to look at the Nissan Leaf which is one size up and offers 400 litres with the rear seats up. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories The Renault Zoe has a logically laid-out cabin, although there’s no scope for customisation, and some plastic trim doesn’t belong in a car with this price tag Renault has dropped the base Play trim for 2022 and the Zoe is now available solely in Techno and Iconic trim levels, this means that you get a posher interior and more equipment as standard. There are a few hard and scratchy plastics, though, not befitting a car of this price and there’s no option to personalise the interior with different colour seats or materials. The previously optional 9.3-inch infotainment unit is now standard on all trims. It is intuitive to use and features sharp and clear graphics but attempting to change settings while on the move is a hit-and-miss affair, as there are no physical shortcut buttons, just a row of small icons along the bottom of the screen. Navigation is standard, and so is Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, so you can choose whether to rely on the handy onboard system or your phone’s apps. You can also configure the screen to display various data in two separate windows. The 10.0-inch digital driver display is also standard and can be controlled via the steering wheel buttons to display sat-nav info, battery levels and a number of other pertinent driver info. Electric range, charging and tax Electric range, charging and tax The Renault Zoe range is now solely available with a 135hp electric motor, the base 110hp version has been dropped. It feels responsive and quick enough at slower speeds, but its 0-60mph time of 9.5 seconds trails most alternatives. The Peugeot e-208 gets to 60mph in 8.1 seconds while the Mini electric is even quicker at 7.3 seconds. It hardly feels underpowered, though, the instant-on torque delivery makes for smooth and quick in-town progress, and it gets up to motorway speeds without issue. Where the Zoe really scores is in its impressive 239 miles of range per charge. The Honda e manages just 131 miles, and even the impressive Peugeot e-208 runs out of juice at 217 miles. You’ll need to look at the one class up Nissan Leaf equipped with its larger optional battery pack to match it. As with all electric cars, achieving those stated ranges requires perfect conditions and Renault says that the range can shrink down to as little as 150 miles in winter. In our own testing, mostly on the motorway, we managed an impressive 229 miles from a charge, which is only 10 miles short of its claimed figure. That's reassuring if you're thinking about the odd longer trip in your Zoe. That brings us to charging, both trims are fitted with a 52kWh battery which takes three hours to charge using a public 22kW charger, or nine hours and 25 minutes using a 7kW wall box at home. The rapid charge option (standard on the Iconic trim) lets you get the most out of a 50kW DC public charging point, this will give you 90 miles of range in just 30 minutes. Safety and security Safety and security The Renault Zoe initially received a full five-star Euro NCAP rating when it was tested in 2013. However, when it was retested under the more stringent methods in 2021, it ended up with a shocking zero stars. A 43% adult occupant and 52% child occupant safety rating aren’t great, but the dismal 14% safety assist rating is what really brought the score down. Part of the blame lies in the removal of the head airbag which used to be standard, as well as lacking certain safety devices that are standard in alternatives. However, the trim that was tested did not include features like lane assist, which is standard on all trims offered in the UK. Other standard passive and active safety equipment includes Easy Park Assist which incorporates front and rear parking sensors and a reversing camera, and you also get cruise control, keyless entry, blind spot warning and a slow speed pedestrian warning system. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems The Zoe has been on sale since 2013, albeit with some significant updates along the way, this should bode well for long term reliability, however, Renault as a brand has not done particularly well in customer satisfaction surveys in recent years. In past years owners praised the low running costs of the Zoe but one in five experienced issues in the first year of ownership. The Zoe does come with a better-than-average warranty with five-year/100,000-mile cover as standard. The battery pack is covered for eight years/100,000 miles and servicing is required only every 18,000 miles. There have been eight recalls since the Zoe has been on sale, with the two most recent issues regarding potential problems with the battery pack. Older problems like arches that could wear down brake hoses were specific to much earlier models and should have been rectified long ago if you are looking at a used option."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/renault/5-e-tech,Renault 5 E-Tech Review & Prices,"€30,999",9/10,new,"Is the Renault 5 E-Tech a good car? Is the Renault 5 E-Tech a good car? The Renault 5 is an all-electric reinvention of an iconic hatchback . It’s good value for money, looks great inside and out, and it’s fun to drive – but being a small, city-friendly electric car , it’s not particularly practical. It’s a bit like finding one of your old football shirts from when you were a kid – the retro charm is very on-trend, but you might have to squeeze to fit in… There are other small electric cars to consider, none of which have particularly cavernous cabins. The Citroen e-C3 and Hyundai Inster are the obvious alternatives, but there’s also the slightly bigger, slightly more expensive BYD Dolphin . Beauty might be in the eye of the beholder but it’s hard to argue that the Renault 5 looks anything other than absolutely fantastic. Its small dimensions, boxy shape and retro look are all inspired by the ‘70s model of the same name, just with a modern spin. There are some cool details, from the broken square daytime running lights (a nod to the original) to the illuminated ‘5’ logo on the bonnet that indicates your battery charge. Range: 192 - 252 miles Efficiency: 4.1 - 4.3 miles per kWh Battery size: 40kWh / 50kWh Max charge speed: 80kW / 100kW Charge time AC: 3h 59m - 4h 51m 0 - 100%, 11kWh Charge time DC: 30 - 31m, 15 - 80%, 80-100kWh Charge port location: Right side front Power outputs: 120hp / 150hp It’s really cool inside, too. The air vents mimic the headlight design and the dashboard ahead of the passenger has fabric, recycled denim or synthetic upholstery, depending on your trim, which looks great. There are some quirky colour combinations to be had, too. Renault has resisted the urge to plaster massive screens in a small car , so the driver display and infotainment are integrated nicely within a single housing. They’re big enough, with blocky graphics that are easy to use on the move. Snappy loading between menus and physical climate controls are further plus points, and Google software means it has useful apps built-in. Entry-level cars get a smaller driver’s display, though. As you might expect of a car this size, it’s not the most practical cabin. Space in the front is okay, especially for the passenger, but taller drivers might find the space beneath the steering wheel a bit tight. The back seats are a touch cramped, too. The flip side of this is the boot, which is an impressive 326 litres – that’s more capacity than you get in both the Mini Cooper Electric and Citroen e-C3. There are two battery options, the smaller one returning up to 190 miles and the larger one offering up to 250 miles, the latter also coming with a more powerful electric motor. That’s about par for the course for small EVs, as the e-C3 gets up to 199 miles between charges, while the Inster has between 203 and 229 miles, depending on the model. Naturally, the Renault 5 is most at home in the city, where its small dimensions and punchy electric motors make it ideal for nipping about in tight, busy urban areas, even if the suspension is a bit stiff, making you aware of small bumps in the road. These attributes also combine to create a car that’s great fun on a twisty road. Because it’s small it’s ideal for narrow strips of Tarmac in the British countryside, and the sharp steering and lack of body roll make it great fun in corners. It’s a bit noisy at motorway speeds, but no more than the Citroen and Hyundai . All in all, the Renault 5 is a fantastic little electric car. It’s oozing charm, and will put a smile on your face every time you drive it – just don’t expect all-round family car practicality. If that sounds ideal for your needs, check out the latest Renault 5 deals on Carwow, as well as Renault 5 leasing deals .

How much is the Renault 5 E-Tech? The Renault 5 is one of the most affordable electric cars you can buy. With a starting price in line with the Hyundai Inster and Citroen e-C3, which one you go for largely comes down to your wants and needs – and potentially it’s as simple as which one you like the look of the most, because our expert reviews team rates all the three highly. Top-spec, big battery versions of the Renault 5 cost more than the equivalent version of the Inster, but go further on a charge too. The Inster’s clever rear seats mean you can choose between massive rear legroom or a really big boot. Meanwhile, the Citroen e-C3 only has one battery option, but it is the cheapest of the trio. If you’re going for the Renault, the entry-level Evolution trim is only available with the smaller battery and 120hp motor, while the Techno and Iconic Five trims can also be specified with the big battery and 150hp motor. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort Nippy about town and fun on a twisty road, but the Renault 5 isn’t particularly refined at higher speeds The Renault 5 was made for the city. The electric motors are smooth and silent, and provide a kick of power that means you can nip out of junctions in heavy traffic with little stress. Its tiny dimensions mean it’s easy to find a parking spot and you’ll never stress about width restrictors. Broken Tarmac can jostle you about a bit and it feels like you crash through potholes rather than smoothly drive over them, but it’s rarely enough to make you grimace and the car is never unsettled. Rear parking sensors come as standard, but if you step up to the Techno trim you also get a rear-view camera, while Iconic Five models get front and side sensors, too. Motorway speeds highlight a few issues with refinement, though again, that’s just small car things. There’s quite a bit of road roar from the tyres, and the wind rushes over the pillar ahead of you. It’s not unbearable, but the Citroen e-C3 is perhaps a fraction quieter on a long drive. That said, the suspension smooths out a bit at higher speeds, which helps with comfort. Cruise control comes as standard, but the Techno trim comes with adaptive cruise control to maintain your speed and distance to the car in front. Top-spec models add lane-centring to help you avoid drifting over the white lines, as well as a blind spot indicator. The Renault 5 lives up to the sporty heritage of its legendary badge. The steering is quick so the car feels eager to turn into a corner, and there’s no body roll which gives you confidence to have fun in the bends. The highlight is the brakes, though; plenty of electric cars struggle to blend regenerative braking and the use of the actual brake pad, but in the Renault 5 you get a firm pedal with a consistent travel, which makes it second nature to judge how much pressure to apply whether coming to a smooth stop in town or scrubbing off speed on the way into a bend on your favourite B road. Space and practicality Space and practicality The boot is just about roomy enough for a weekly shop, but this is not a practical car overall The trade off for a small, nippy car is that you’re never going to be blessed with loads of space inside. There’s a decent amount of adjustability in the steering wheel and seat so you can get comfortable, but if you have long legs it can feel pretty cramped around your lower half. There’s impressive legroom for your passenger to stretch out, though. Storage is pretty good, with shallow door bins, a couple of cup holders between the seats and a deep area to store things out of sight in the armrest. There’s also a wireless phone charging pad on all but the entry-level trim. It’s not great in the back seats, where a six-footer won’t want to sit behind another six-footer for long. Kneeroom is tight, so you’ll struggle to relax your thighs on the cushion, though you can at least put your feet under the seats in front to rest them flat, and the rear doors mean you’re not clambering behind the front seats like you do in the two-door Mini Cooper Electric. Most small cars have tight rear seats, to be fair, but if you regularly carry people in the back the Hyundai Inster is your best bet, because the rear bench can be pushed back for massive legroom (at the expense of boot capacity). Storage options are limited, with small door bins and no pockets in the seat in front, nor an armrest with extra cup holders. There are no USB-C slots in the back either. ISOFIX anchor points are really easy to access, though you’ll probably have to put bulkier child seats behind an empty passenger seat that’s pushed forward. At first glance the Renault 5’s boot looks quite tight, but its capacity is respectable compared with alternatives, and the square shape means you can maximise the space on offer. At 326 litres there’s more space than the 310 litres you get in the Citroen e-C3. With the rear seats pushed forward, the Hyundai Inster offers 351 litres, but if you push them back to make room for passengers, this drops to just 238 litres. The BYD Dolphin has 345 litres but it does cost a bit more, while the Mini Cooper Electric trails behind all with 210 litres. There is quite a chunky lip to lift items over, which means putting heavy suitcases in the back of the Renault 5 could be a bit tricky. The rear seats fold from a catch that’s easy to reach, but doing this does create quite a ridge. Underfloor storage is useful for cables, too. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories Cool materials and a slick infotainment system are good, but you can find cheap plastics here and there Despite its affordable price, the Renault 5 doesn’t feel cheap inside. The design is cool and characterful, with air vents mimicking the broken square shape seen on the daytime running lights, while clever use of fabrics and synthetic leathers (depending on trim) mean there are no cheap plastics falling to hand. All models get a twin-screen setup for the infotainment and driver’s display, but the latter is a 7.0-inch unit in the entry-level trim, and 10.3 inches in the rest of the range. The highlight is the 10.1-inch infotainment screen though, because it runs Google software, which means you have lots of useful apps like Maps with optimised routes for EV driving. The graphics are blocky and therefore easy to use on the move, and loading between menus is snappy. Android Auto and Apple CarPlay are standard-fit, too. There’s a bank of physical controls beneath the screen for the climate controls, which is much easier to use than the current trend for doing everything through the screens as you’ll find in many other cars. Material quality is largely decent for the price – there are some cheap plastics to be found but you do have to go searching for them. Most of the stuff you see and touch is a mix of interesting fabrics or leather, depending on the trim, which feels much more fun and adds character in a way a sea of black plastic trim never could. Electric range, charging and tax Electric range, charging and tax You have a choice of two batteries and two motor outputs. The first is a 40kWh battery with a 120hp motor, which returns a range of 190 miles, while the 50kWh battery with its 150hp motor can go up to 253 miles. That’s the same ballpark as alternatives – the Citroen e-C3 has one battery option and a range of 199 miles, but it’s not available with a heat pump so your range is likely to drop a lot in cold weather. The Renault gets one as standard. Compared with the Hyundai Inster, that has two battery options, with the smaller one able to go up to 203 miles and the bigger one up to 229 miles. In the real world the difference between comparable models will be negligible, though. The other thing to note is that the smaller battery doesn’t top up as quickly at a public fast charger – 80kW compared with 100kW. However, because of the difference in battery size both will go from 15-80% in about half an hour. The Renault 5 is a great option for company car choosers because electric cars face the lowest Benefit-in-Kind rates. It’s a similar story for private buyers because EVs fall into the lowest first-year car tax bracket, and it avoids the expensive car supplement in years two to six. Safety and security Safety and security The Renault 5 scored four stars out of five in Euro NCAP safety testing, though it didn’t score particularly poorly in any of the four categories. It comes with all the basic safety kit such as emergency lane-keeping, intelligent speed assistance based on road signs, and active emergency braking. Iconic Five models get extra kit such as front, side and rear parking sensors, hands-free parking assistance, rear cross traffic alert and blind spot warning. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems The Renault 5 has not been on sale long enough to get a good picture of its reliability, though it is worth noting that Renault didn’t perform brilliantly in the 2024 Driver Power owner satisfaction survey, coming 28th out of 32 manufacturers. All Renaults come with a three-year warranty, which is unlimited mileage in the first two years or up to 100,000 miles in the third. The electric powertrain is covered for four years/100,000 miles, while the main traction battery is covered for eight years/100,000 miles with a guarantee that it will retain more than 70% of its original capacity."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/renault/koleos,Renault Koleos Review and Prices,"€39,060",6/10,new,"The Renault Koleos SUV is basically the same underneath as the Nissan X-Trail. However, unlike the Nissan, which has the option of seven seats, the Renault comes only as a five-seater, making it an alternative to the Skoda Kodiaq, Ford Kuga and Honda CR-V. Unsurprisingly, the Koleos looks very like Renault’s other SUV, the smaller Kadjar, at the front, but with plenty of smarter trim and chrome to reflect its position higher in the company’s range. It’s a sensation that is continued inside, where the standard sunroof makes the cabin feel nice and airy. It’s all very smart, too, and the Koleos gets Renault’s R-LINK 2 infotainment system in either seven-inch landscape form or with an 8.7-inch portrait display. The latter comes as standard on top-of-the-range models and it’s pretty to look and simple to use, although you’ll sometimes find its directions hard to follow and it’s frustrating that you have to use it to make minor adjustments to the ventilation system. Interior quality is a mixed bag, too. Although there is stitched leather on the centre console’s grab handles, as well as shiny chrome trim pieces, the plastics look and feel cheaper than you would get in a Skoda Kodiaq. What’s not open to criticism is how much space there is inside the Koleos. As Renault hasn’t had to make room for a third row of seats, all five passengers are treated to acres of head and legroom. The small hump in the floor and wide rear seats means that, even with three in the back, everyone should be happy. The seats are all comfortable and, thanks to the wide range of adjustment on the driver’s seat and steering wheel, pretty much anyone can get a good driving position. Perhaps the biggest reason for choosing the Renault Koleos over the Kadjar is the size of the boot. Even with all five seats upright, the boot will take the best part of 600 litres, which is more than enough for most families. Drop the rear seats and you have almost 2,000 litres to play with. All very impressive… I just don’t get it. Why doesn’t Renault sell a Koleos with seven seats, like the Nissan X-Trail? With only five seats, this is just a bigger, more expensive Kadjar – and, if I was picking between the two, I’d always choose the cheaper car. With that in mind, it’s no surprise that the Koleos feels like a large car to drive, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing. Unless you’re in town, you’ll only feel the worst bumps, while it’s nice and quiet inside the cabin, even at high speeds. The suspension feels quite soft, as you would expect, but the body lean is reasonably well contained unless you’re cornering very quickly. Overall, though, a Skoda Kodiaq feels sharper to drive. There are just two engines to choose from – both diesel – and the more powerful 177hp 2.0-litre model comes as standard with four-wheel drive, a combination that actually makes the Koleos pretty handy off-road. Alternatively, to make life on-road a little easier, the same engine can also be specified with a CVT automatic gearbox that shifts smoothly and doesn’t cause the annoying drone you get in other gearboxes of this type. Overall, though, unless you want four-wheel drive or an automatic, the 130hp 1.6-litre diesel feels pretty much as quick as the more powerful engine in everyday use and should return close to 50mpg if driven carefully. For most people, it’ll be the best engine to choose, especially as it’s the cheaper option in a range that looks quite expensive. On the other hand, there is some justification for the high price, as the car comes with lots of equipment as standard. That includes a full-length glass roof, sat-nav, part-leather seats, ambient lighting and cup holders that can heat or cool drinks. Last, but not least, the car also scored a full five stars in Euro NCAP safety tests, which is just what any parent will want to see in a family car. Overall, the Koleos is worth considering if you want an extremely comfortable SUV with a big boot, but don’t need seven seats. Its off-road ability and generous standard equipment are further attractions, but some of the alternatives feel better built, are more fun to drive and give you the option to specify seven seats."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/renault/symbioz,Renault Symbioz Review & Prices,"€35,796",8/10,new,"Is the Renault Symbioz a good car? Is the Renault Symbioz a good car? The Renault Symbioz is a bit like a Renault Captur that’s been out and got bum implants. From the front, you’d never know the two cars were different - the only changes come when you go round the rear, where the Symbioz has a longer body and a bigger boot. In many ways it’s sort of like an estate version of the Captur - like a Volkswagen Golf Estate is to a regular Golf hatchback . It’s aimed at people who like the Captur but want more space inside, and who can’t quite stretch up to the pricier, posher Renault Austral . Though it’s a little smaller, it provides an interesting alternative to super-popular family SUVs such as the Nissan Qashqai , Kia Sportage or Skoda Karoq . We’re not kidding when we tell you the Symbioz looks like a Captur. In fact, take the two cars in the same colour and from the front doors forwards, you’ll be hard-pressed to notice any changes at all. They’re limited to a couple of chrome flashes in the lower bumper line for the Symbioz, a slightly different pattern to the grille, and some alternative alloy wheel designs. The changes come from the rear doors backwards, where the Symbioz has a longer body with a bigger rear overhang to make more room for a big boot. The roofline and rear windows have been altered to accommodate this, and there’s a slightly more chiselled pattern on the rear doors. The interior's very similar too. The dashboards are identical, and feature a Google-powered infotainment system that's a pleasure to use. One feature the Symbioz has over the Captur is its stunning 'Solarbay' glass roof - this eschews a traditional blind for electrochromic glass which can become opaque at the touch of a button. Very fancy. The Symbioz has a 492-litre boot, which is quite a bit larger than the 348-litre boot you get on a hybrid Captur (the plain petrol Captur has 422 litres of space). That’s a little less room than the 504-litre Nissan Qashqai, 521-litre Skoda Karoq or 587-litre Kia Sportage, but impressive for what’s still quite a small car overall. The Symbioz is being pitched as a slightly more premium offering to the Captur, too. That means you don’t get a base-spec ‘Evolution’ trim level, nor can you specify the Captur’s 90hp petrol engine and manual gearbox. All Symbioz models come with Renault’s E-Tech hybrid system , which is super-efficient, promising over 60mpg if driven carefully. It’s a little clunky, though, thanks to its complicated gearbox, and that’s mirrored in the suspension which can feel quite firm when you’re driving round town at low speeds. In most scenarios, though, the Symbioz is perfectly fine to drive - though the extra weight does mean a Captur is more enjoyable. Interested?

Remember too that Carwow can even help you sell your car when the time comes. How much is the Renault Symbioz? How much is the Renault Symbioz? The Renault Symbioz starts out from just under £30,000 - it’s a little less than £3,000 more than the equivalent Captur. That’s very similar to the starting prices of a Nissan Qashqai or Kia Sportage, but if you want hybrid versions of those you’ll pay closer to £35,000, making the Symbioz look quite appealing. The base-spec trim is called Techno, and like the name suggests you get plenty of tech - there’s a 10.4-inch touchscreen running Android software, plus a high-res 10.25-inch driver display. You also get adaptive cruise control , climate control, LED lights and keyless entry. Stepping up to Techno esprit Alpine gets you heated front seats, a powered tailgate and a slightly different look with a silver portion in the front bumper and black alloy wheels. Iconic esprit Alpine gets a posh Harman Kardon sound system, 360-degree camera system, hands-free parking and Renault’s trick panoramic sunroof which can become opaque or clear at the press of a button. It still comes in at less than a base-spec Qashqai or Sportage hybrid, at just over £33,000. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort Comfortable on the motorway and nippy around town, but the hybrid engine doesn’t like being rushed The Symbioz feels a lot like the Captur to drive around town, which is no bad thing. Despite the extra bulk behind the rear axle, it’s still compact enough to make manoeuvring easy, and as it’s no wider than the Captur you don’t feel concerned about things like width restrictions or parking on a tight road. The controls are light and visibility is decent out the front, though the rear window is a bit narrow and there’s a blindspot over your shoulder. The camera feed from the rear-view monitor is also very low-res. The hybrid engine is at its best around town, where it spends quite a bit of time running on electric power alone. It can be a bit noisy when the engine kicks in, though, and sometimes it feels as though it’s just waiting to change up a gear but never does. The main issue at low speeds is that the suspension is quite firm over bumps, potholes and speed cushions. It can lead to your head being tossed around a bit on uneven roads. A Nissan Qashqai or Skoda Karoq are much more comfortable if you spend a lot of time in town. On faster roads, the suspension settles down so you only really feel the larger bumps and potholes. On the larger alloy wheels, there can be a little bit of road noise, but it’s not overly intrusive and there are certainly louder cars you can buy. The engine is just fine when you’re cruising along - it’s quiet, and powerful enough for overtaking or short sliproads. It can get noisy under acceleration, though, and when you’ve got your foot down the hybrid system can be clunky - the hand-off between petrol power and electric power isn’t the smoothest, and happens a few times as you run up the petrol engine’s four gears. Adaptive cruise control is standard and works pretty well, as does the lane-keeping assistance. Combined with the excellent Google Maps-based sat-nav, it helps to make long journeys easier. The Symbioz is on a par with the Nissan Qashqai and the Skoda Karoq in terms of fun handling. It corners keenly and the body doesn’t roll around too much, but the steering is so light that you don’t really have much feedback as to what the front wheels are doing. There are customisable driving modes, including a ‘Sport’ mode - but this doesn’t really make the Symbioz any more fun. It does make the steering heavier and the engine more keen, but not really more enjoyable. The hybrid system and indeed the suspension are both at their best when you take it a bit more easily - if you want an SUV that’s good fun to punt down a twisty road, try the Ford Kuga. Space and practicality Space and practicality A big boot and practical cabin - but it’s not very wide for three adults The Symbioz is identical to a Renault Captur from the front doors forward, and that’s a pretty good thing in terms of practicality. The driving position is good, and widely customisable - top-spec models get electric seats, and there’s plenty of adjustment in both them and the steering wheel. The seats are very comfortable, too, especially on esprit Alpine models which get sports seats. There are lots of storage spaces, though they’re mainly meant for small items. A pair of quite compact cupholders sit in front of a narrow armrest with a cubby underneath it. In front of this there’s a slot where you can leave the car’s keycard, and a wireless charging pad sits underneath the gear selector platform. In front of that, there’s a larger area for keys and wallets, and another slot immediately underneath the touchscreen which will also fit phones - though only small ones. Reasonably-sized door bins will fit a big bottle of water, and though the glovebox isn’t full-width as it also has to accommodate the fusebox it’s very deep so you still get a reasonable amount of space. The Symbioz has a little more legroom in the rear than the Captur, which was already quite spacious. Even though it’s actually smaller than a Nissan Qashqai or Skoda Karoq, it’s on a par with them for passenger legroom and headroom. If your rear passengers are fairly short, you can even slide the rear seat forward to increase your boot space. Do note though that the stunning Solarbay roof robs some headroom too. It’s no wider than a Captur, though, so fitting three adults across the rear seat will be a struggle. The middle seat is quite narrow, and it’s raised to reduce headroom - plus, there’s a small transmission tunnel, though the footwells on either side of it are plenty big enough for everyone’s feet. You don’t get a rear armrest, which is a shame, but there are small door bins for a little bit of additional storage. ISOFIX points are present on both outer rear seats as well as the front passenger seat, so you can carry up to three child seats. The Symbioz has 492 litres of boot space with the rear seats in their rearmost position. That’s pretty close to the 504 litres you get with a Nissan Qashqai, though the Skoda Karoq and hybrid-powered Kia Sportage both have more with 521 and 587 litres respectively. Slide the Renault’s seats forward, though, and you liberate an impressive 624 litres of space - however, that comes at the expense of nearly all the rear legroom, so you should only do it if you have very short rear passenger or perhaps children in booster seats. When the seats are slid forward there is an awkward gap between the rest of the boot floor and the seatbacks, though, which items can fall into very easily. For most scenarios, it’ll be easier to fold the seats flat. They split 60:40, lie at the same level as the boot floor to allow for easy sliding of items to the very back, and create an impressive 1,582-litre load bay. There are a few bag hooks in the boot as well as an adjustable boot floor with some space underneath it. You can also sit the floor vertically to divide the boot into two sections, great if you have smaller items that you don’t want to roll about and potentially get damaged. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories A cracking infotainment system, but material quality leaves something to be desired The Symbioz has exactly the same dashboard as a Renault Captur, which has some good and some bad features. It’s well-designed, for starters - there’s a large portrait infotainment screen that’s positioned within easy reach but doesn’t block your view out the front at all. It even has some physical switches underneath it for commonly-used climate controls, which is brilliant as it means you don’t have to root around in sub-menus just to change the fan speed like you do in a Volkswagen Tiguan . The infotainment system is another highlight. It’s powered by Google, so you get access to apps like Google Maps as well as one of the best voice assistants currently available. It’s also quick to respond to touch, and Renault’s own menu system also makes good sense. Material quality does feel a couple of steps underneath a Nissan Qashqai or a Skoda Karoq, though. The door cards in particular are made from hard, scratchy plastic, so it’s not very comfortable to rest your arm on, and some of the switches - such as those on the steering wheel - feel quite cheap. MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax The Symbioz is very efficient. Renault claims it can do 60.1mpg, and during a week with it we averaged 56mpg - an impressive figure. A hybrid Nissan Qashqai will top out around 45mpg in the real world. CO2 emissions are an equally impressive 107g/km, which means lower first year tax rates and lower company car tax. It slots into the 26% Benefit-in-Kind bracket, though this is still much higher than an electric or plug-in hybrid SUV of comparable size like a VW Tiguan eHybrid. Safety and security Safety and security The Renault Symbioz inherits the Captur’s four-star Euro NCAP safety rating. That’s not as impressive as the five stars achieved by the Karoq, Qashqai or Sportage - but those cars were tested in 2017, 2021 and 2022 respectively, and so weren’t evaluated quite as strictly. In terms of safety equipment, you don’t get the most up-to-date features like a drivers knee airbag or a central airbag between the front passengers. You do get the full suite of active safety assistance features, though. Renault also makes it really easy to turn off the more annoying mandatory warnings. You just have to set up a ‘My Safety Perso’ profile, deciding which ones you’d like turned off or on - such as the speed limit warning. Once you’ve set this up, it’s just two clicks of an easy-to-locate button to activate this profile. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems The Renault Symbioz is mechanically almost identical to the Captur, and so that car’s generally positive reliability rating should carry over. The Captur has only been recalled once, for an issue with a seatbelt buckle. Renault scored poorly in the 2024 Driver Power owner satisfaction survey , though, coming 28th out of 32 brands and quite a way behind Skoda, Nissan and Kia. A usefully long five-year warranty is good, though, and longer than the three years you get from Skoda or Nissan. Kia offers seven years of cover on its Sportage, though.

https://www.carwow.co.uk/renault/grand-scenic,Renault Grand Scenic Review and Prices,"€33,029",7/10,new,"The Renault Grand Scenic is a large family MPV that combines the practicality of seven seats with wild styling that helps it stand out from the likes of the VW Sharan and SEAT Alhambra. Take the Renault’s standard 20-inch alloy wheels for example. They’re larger than the wheels you’ll find on some Aston Martins and look like they’ve been pinched from some kind of sci-fi concept car. You could say the same about the strange kink in the Renault Grand Scenic’s side windows – although this serves a practical purpose letting small children see out and stopping them feel car sick on long drives. Less exciting is how the Renault Grand Scenic looks inside. If its exterior could make a convincing Star Wars prop, its cabin looks like it belongs on the set of Gone with the Wind. Almost everything’s either black or very dark grey and you’ll have to pay for a high-spec model if you want any kind of leather trim or mood lighting. Even the menus on the portrait infotainment system are a bit dark and dingy, but at least this touchscreen is relatively easy to use – if not quite as intuitive as the VW’s system with its extra menu shortcut buttons. You won’t buy a big seven-seater just because its cabin looks nice, though – rather you’ll be persuaded to part with your cash if it’s easy to live with. In this respect, the Renault Grand Scenic’s clever sliding seats and roomy cabin grant it plenty of brownie points. There’s space for three adults in the middle row and just about enough space for two more in the back – although, a VW Sharan is a bit more spacious still. The Renault Grand Scenic is a spacious seven-seater that could be your ideal MPV if how a car looks is just as important as how easy it is to live with. The VW also has a bigger boot than the Renault Grand Scenic, but both are huge once you fold all the back seats down. Even with the boot filled to the brim, the Renault Grand Scenic’s engines have enough poke to pull you along quite happily. The diesel version’s nice and quiet on motorways and is impressively economical. If you do lots of short journeys, especially in town, the petrol engine’s a better bet. The Renault Grand Scenic’s big windows and raised driving position also help make it feel at home in cities. The steering’s nice and light to help you manoeuvre it easily and you get parking sensors as standard, but the Renault’s huge wheels highlight bumps and potholes more than the smaller wheels you get on the VW and SEAT. That being said, the Renault Grand Scenic’s still pretty relaxing to drive – especially if you pay extra for the optional automatic gearbox. It’s not the smoothest unit around but it saves you from having to constantly change gear in heavy traffic. It also comes with automatic emergency braking and lane departure warning which help make the Renault Grand Scenic one of the safest MPVs on sale and certainly worth considering if you’re on the hunt for a safe and stylish family car. Check out our Renault Grand Scenic deals to see how much you can save on one."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/renault/twingo,Renault Twingo Review and Prices,"€14,122",5/10,new,"The Renault Twingo is the smallest car that Renault makes and it’s an alternative to other little city slickers, such as the Volkswagen Up, Toyota Aygo and Hyundai i10. However, if you’re familiar with previous generations of the Twingo, this is something very different. It was developed alongside the Smart ForFour, so this latest version is a rear-engined, rear-wheel drive car – a layout that has real benefits in terms of how much space the car has inside and how easy it is to drive around town. Mind you, there’s no sign of that revolutionary (for a city car) layout from the outside. That said, the car certainly looks very distinctive and, as with most little cars these days, there’s lots of scope for the owner to personalise their car. Everything from the colour of the paint to the alloy wheels can be tailored to your wishes, while you can also add on extra decals to make your car stand out. Inside, too, the contrasting colours and strong design inject a bit of fun into the experience. And, as long as you avoid the base model, you can add a few more touches of personalisation. One more clever touch is that Renault has an app that you can install on your smartphone. You then clip it into a cradle in the car, giving you an instant touchscreen, which you can use to control the sat-nav, phone and stereo. If you want a larger touchscreen, you can fit the optional R-Link system, which has an integrated 7.0-inch screen, through which you control the various parts of the infotainment system. Where the Renault Twingo really stands out from the alternatives is how much room it has inside. Four adults can fit with ease and getting in and out is not the contortionist’s feat it can be in some small cars. Mind you, the optional fabric sunroof reduces the available headroom quite significantly, so be sure that won’t be a problem before ticking that box. That excellent cabin space is thanks to having the engine at the back, but there are some compromises with that layout. Most obviously, as the engine sits below the boot floor, the boot capacity is only 188 litres, which is a little less than you’ll find in an Up, for example. When I read that the Twingo was going to be a small, rear-engined, rear-wheel car, I was really excited. Then I drove it. What a disappointment. You can increase this by putting the rear seat backs up to 90 degrees, which isn’t especially comfortable, but there’s also around 50 litres of storage dotted around in the cabin too in various pockets and bins. You can also fold the front passenger seat flat and the Renault Twingo will accept loads up to 2.3-metres long. The one thing that the rear-engined layout doesn’t do is to turn the Twingo into some sort of mini-Porsche 911 supercar, which famously shares the same arrangement. In fact, this doesn’t feel like a particularly sporty car to drive at all – but it’s not without its benefits. For example, with no engine at the front of the car, the nose feels a lot lighter. And, because the car is rear-wheel drive, the front wheels can turn further than in a front-wheel drive car, giving a very tight turning circle. As a result, the car is wonderfully easy to manoeuvre around town and get into the smallest parking spaces. However, on the open road, it’s not the most enjoyable little car to drive. In part, that’s because the stability control system is a little over-eager to get involved when the driver gets a little keener and starts to tackle bends a bit more quickly. Likewise, the Twingo isn’t the most comfortable little car, especially the models with larger wheels fitted. The VW Up and Hyundai i10 both have a more settled and more mature feel on the road. As is often the case with these small cars, there’s only a small range of engines to pick from. So, if you want a Twingo, you can only choose between two engines: a 1.0-litre unit with 70hp and a more powerful 0.9-litre turbo, with 90hp. The 1.0-litre unit is enough if you spend most of your time driving around town, but it’s worth going for the stronger unit if you plan on making longer journeys beyond the city limits. No matter where you’re heading, you’ll be pleased to know that the Renault Twingo has a reasonable four-star rating from Euro NCAP, which is pretty much identical to what you’ll find in most alternatives. Less happily, the Renault Twingo costs a bit more than the most obvious alternatives, but every model comes well equipped – with DAB radio, front electric windows, split folding rear seats, LED daytime running lights, a tyre pressure monitoring system and USB connectivity. Despite that high level of standard equipment and generous space for passengers, the Twingo is hard to recommend over the alternatives. It’s a little on the pricey side at the bottom end of the range and, while the more expensive models (with the stronger engine) make more sense, they cost as much as larger vehicles that offer far more space."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/renault/megane,Renault Megane Review and Prices,"€29,069",7/10,new,"This version of the Renault Megane first came on sale in 2016 but received a range of updates in 2018, including improvements to the infotainment system and more space for passengers. The Megane is similar in size to the Hyundai i30, Kia Ceed and Ford Focus, but also shares a lot of parts with the Renault Kadjar SUV. The Renault Megane’s interior looks simpler than in most alternatives so most of the buttons are easy to locate. High-spec models also get a portrait-style infotainment system, similar to what you’d find in more expensive Volvo cars. The rest of the cabin is well put together and has some silver accents to break up the otherwise all-black colour scheme. Getting a good driving position is easy even in the entry-level Renault Megane because they get height-adjustable front seats as standard. You can also set the seat nice and low for a sporty feel and front seat passenger space is good. Accessing the rear seats is easy thanks to wide-opening doors and you can fit two adults without much hassle – three would be a push, because the middle rear seat is narrower than the outer two. In terms of practicality, the Renault Megane’s boot is just about big enough for a week’s holiday worth of luggage and the opening is wide enough so you won’t have problems loading bulky items. However, some alternatives, such as the Kia Ceed, have a lower load lip making them even more practical. The Renault Megane won’t wow you with a sporty drive, but you’ll be impressed by how comfortable it is. There are two engines to choose from in the Renault Megane range so picking the right one is easy. The 140bhp petrol is hushed on the move and feels best darting around city streets. The 115bhp diesel is perfect for longer motorway journeys where it settles nicely into a cruise and uses very little fuel. Driving the Renault Megane feels best on the motorway. Once up to speed there’s little wind noise and the Megane absorbs bumps very well. That isn’t to say it’s not good around town – there, the quick steering helps you dart in and out of traffic with confidence, however the manual gear shift is notchy and not that pleasurable to use. No matter if you drive in town or on the motorway, the Renault Megane is a safe car. It was awarded the full five stars from EuroNCAP and, as standard, you get essentials such as airbags, an advanced stability control system and hill-hold assist. Mid-range models also get lane departure warning, traffic sign recognition and automatic high-low beam as standard."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/renault/austral,Renault Austral Review & Prices,"€43,058",8/10,new,"Is the Renault Austral a good car? Is the Renault Austral a good car? The Renault Austral is one of many mid-sized SUVs vying for your attention, making it an alternative to the likes of the Nissan Qashqai , Hyundai Tucson , Kia Sportage , Peugeot 3008 and Volkswagen Tiguan - to name a few. With impressive options available everywhere you turn, the Renault Austral attempts to stand out with a few key features - a really posh interior, great software, and a trick hybrid system which gives this medium-sized family car fuel economy to rival many a small hatchback. It’s like shopping at a designer outlet store - you can feel like you’re living the high life for less money than you expect, but it doesn’t come without compromise. The Austral is a smart-looking SUV, with its fairly square silhouette tempered by rounded corners and some distinctive styling features. The bold headlights, large grille and huge Renault badge mean you won’t mistake it for anything else, while the rear gets similarly wide taillights (though not a full-width light bar) and a sporty-looking diffuser on the bumper. The interior is similarly stylish, with a large portrait touchscreen canted towards the driver for a really focused, cockpit-like feel. There’s even a handrest in the middle that feels like an aircraft throttle, though this actually contains a wireless charging pad and hides a storage cubby underneath it. That central touchscreen runs a fantastic Google-based infotainment system. This means that not only is it swift and responsive, but it has native support for Google apps - including the best maps in the business, and other useful touches like music streaming services baked right in. While the Austral does feature smartphone mirroring tech, if you’re already using Google services you might not find that you need it here. While the Austral’s interior punches above its price tag, the space inside is only average. A Skoda Karoq does have more rear-seat space, and more flexible arrangements for the boot. While the Austral has a sliding rear seat, you need it pushed all the way back to fit people in - at which point you only have a 430-litre boot, which is among the smallest of all the alternatives. A Nissan Qashqai, Kia Sportage and Skoda Karoq are all larger. Renault offers the Austral with just one engine - a complex hybrid arrangement using a 1.2-litre petrol engine and a pair of electric motors. It’s fiendishly complicated and shuffles the power about in ways that don’t always seem logical. The result can feel quite clunky if you accelerate hard or are trying to hustle down a back road, but it’s perfectly smooth when you’re driving sensibly - and means this relatively large SUV can easily return over 50mpg. The driving experience is a lot like the rest of the car - it has its good moments and bad. The steering is nice and accurate, and the Austral is comfortable on a long trip - but the firm suspension means it clatters over bumps at low speeds around town, making small potholes and bumps feel much larger than they are. At launch, the Renault Austral was offered with a cool four-wheel steering system which made it incredibly manoeuvrable around town. However, as of 2024, this is no longer offered If you want a great price for this family-friendly SUV, check out our best Renault Austral deals on Carwow here. You can find used Australs for sale here, or see other used Renaults for sale here.

How much is the Renault Austral? The Renault Austral looks a little more expensive at first than most mid-sized SUV alternatives - however, it’s got a hybrid engine as standard and comes very well-equipped even from the base model. It’s actually a few hundred pounds less than the entry-level Kia Sportage hybrid, and around the same price as a Vauxhall Grandland hybrid. All models come with a pretty good level of equipment. The 12.0-inch touchscreen is standard, as is climate control and a full suite of driver aids. The base model even looks smart thanks to its 19-inch alloy wheels, though you’ll need to spend a little extra to get a two-tone paint finish which does compliment the styling much better than one solid colour. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort Hybrid engine is great around town and the Austral is comfortable on the motorway, but it’s too bumpy at low speeds The Renault Austral feels generally well-suited to driving in town. The hybrid engine is smooth most of the time, with the electric motor taking you away from the line smoothly and the engine cutting in a bit later. It’s less hesitant than most automatic petrol or diesel SUVs, like a Skoda Karoq, and going around at low speeds on electric power alone is hushed. Visibility is pretty good thanks to large wing mirrors, and all models get a rear-view camera - though the rear window is a little narrow. The most irritating thing around town is the suspension. There’s no option for adaptive suspension like you get on a Volkswagen Tiguan, and as a result the Austral is too firm all the time - whether you’re on the base model with its slightly smaller wheels or the top-spec car with its big ones. The comfortable seats do take the edge off, but it’s still annoying hitting lumps and bumps at low speeds. The Austral used to be available with a clever four-wheel steering system making it unique among SUVs of this type, but as of 2024 that system is no longer available in the UK. It was a pretty niche offering anyway, being an optional extra on the top-spec car, and though it was fun having a London taxi-esque turning circle it’s not especially missed. Some hybrid cars feel a little out of their depth on the motorway but the Austral doesn’t at all. With 200hp on tap, it’s plenty powerful enough, and thanks to excellent fuel economy and a decent-sized fuel tank you’ll be able to go a good distance between fill-ups, not always a given with hybrid cars like this. The hybrid system can feel a little weird when you put your foot down - the electric motor takes over while the complex gearbox changes ratios, but this can take a while and results in a slightly lumpy power delivery. It’s only noticeable under full throttle, though, which you’ll rarely need to use. The Austral’s 1.2-litre petrol engine is hushed at a cruise and though tyre noise is audible, wind noise is admirably well-contained. The assisted driving features are also pretty well-behaved, with lane-keep assist and adaptive cruise control that actually take the sting out of long trips rather than introducing a whole new annoyance. The Austral’s design may be sporty - especially if you opt for one of the trim levels that’s covered in Alpine badging - but it’s not sporty to drive. The steering is light and doesn’t really offer any feedback, and while the suspension is firm it does lean a fair bit in the bends. The driving modes don’t make much difference - in Sport you’ll notice that the engine holds onto its revs for a bit longer, but the steering doesn’t really weight up much. As with motorway driving, if you put your foot down then the slightly odd power delivery of the complex hybrid system comes to light, but if you’re more gentle then it’s perfectly fine. Space and practicality Space and practicality Good storage for small items, but only average rear seats and quite a small boot Practicality is hugely important for family SUVs and here the Austral is a bit of a mixed bag. Very tall drivers might find the seat doesn’t go quite far back enough for them, but most everybody else will be able to get perfectly comfortable in the front. Top-spec models get electric adjustment for the seats, too, while the panoramic sunroof adds a nice feeling of spaciousness. Big door bins and a reasonably roomy glovebox provide good storage, and there’s a deep cubby under the central armrest too. The centre console has two cupholders, though they’re set quite deep and a little awkward to access. There’s also a hidden storage area underneath the sliding armrest, but you can’t access this if you’ve anything in the cupholders. With the moveable rear bench on top-spec cars, you can choose to prioritise room for passengers or storage. If you go for the latter, you get just enough legroom for an adult behind a driver of average height, while headroom is okay even when the panoramic roof is in place. Moving the bench back enhances the legroom and you’ll be comfortable on a long drive. The middle seat is slightly raised but the seat base is squidgy for you to get comfortable. Three adults across the back will be squeezed a bit, but children will have enough space. Storage in the back is a touch smaller than in the front, but you get decent door bins and nets on the seat backs, while USB-C ports offer charging for portable devices. There are two Isofix points in the outer rear seats, plus an additional one in the front passenger seat. If you get the Austral with the sliding rear bench, you get up 555 litres in the boot. Without it, the seats are fixed in their rearmost position and you have just 430 litres on offer – which is relatively pokey compared to the alternatives. You don’t get much underfloor space, while the lip to load things over is a bit deep. The Kia Sportage offers 587 litres like-for-like with the hybrid Austral, while the ever-popular Nissan Qashqai’s offering is smaller at 504 litres with the e-Power model. The Hyundai Tucson in self-charging hybrid form has 616 litres, while the eHybrid version of the Volkswagen Tiguan has 476 litres. While folding the rear seats down offers you up to 1,455 litres, the space itself isn’t the most practical. There’s a ridge between the boot floor and the folded seat backs, so sliding things through is very awkward indeed. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories A stylish, well-built and easy to use cabin, but a bit dark without the panoramic sunroof Renault’s really scoring highly with its interiors of late, and the Austral is no exception. It feels like an ideal blend of high-tech and user-friendly, and build quality is high too. All models get a trio of screens. The driver’s display is 12.3-inches across and while it’s not quite as customisable as the one you get on premium offerings like a BMW X3 or VW Tiguan, it’s clear and bright with all the information you could reasonably want. Above this sits a 9.3-inch head-up display, which gives you essential info projected onto your windscreen so you don’t need to refocus your eyes. The infotainment screen is portrait-oriented and 12.0-inches across, which is a really good size - it dominates the cabin but doesn’t extend obnoxiously into your eyeline like the massive display on the Volkswagen Tiguan does. Better yet, Renault’s maintained a good number of physical buttons - there’s a row of climate controls under the screen, and some shortcut buttons the other side of the steering wheel - including one that lets you customise the car’s safety equipment quickly. There’s also Renault’s trademark stereo controller protruding from a stalk behind the wheel, but added to the indicator and wiper stalks as well as the drive selector, this does make the steering column rather busy. The best thing about the interior tech is that Renault’s infotainment runs the Android operating system. Not only is this easy to use - just like a phone, really - but it gives you access to native apps like Google Maps and Spotify, as well as the best voice recognition software in the business. There’s also wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity, and a wireless charging pad in the central armrest. Material quality throughout is very nice, and Esprit Alpine models get attractive blue stitching and faux-suede panels. The one criticism is that all models are unrelentingly monochrome - a lighter colour option would be nice, as the Austral can be very dark if you don’t have a model with the panoramic sunroof. MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax The Austral’s official fuel consumption is over 60mpg, and we found 50mpg easy to achieve in mixed driving. Unlike some hybrid systems, the Austral’s economy doesn’t suffer if you do lots of motorway driving, either - it’s efficient regardless of the type of road you’re on. That’s a big improvement on the Nissan Qashqai e-Power, which while it returns excellent fuel economy in town driving dips below 40mpg on the motorway. CO2 emissions are a low 105g/km, which puts first year road tax at an affordable rate and makes the Austral a pretty good choice for a company car - though it’s of course bested by plug-in hybrid alternatives. No Austral costs more than £40,000, so you won’t have to pay the expensive car supplement for the first five years of ownership either. Safety and security Safety and security Tested by Euro NCAP , the Renault Austral has a five-star safety rating, scoring especially well in occupant and safety assist categories – all above 80%. For the assists on this car, you have up to 30 systems to make your driving experience as safe as possible. As standard, you get lane keep assist and departure warning, traffic sign recognition, blind spot warning, active emergency braking, driver attention alert and distance warning alert. We found the warnings to be fairly inoffensive, but Renault does allow you to configure your own settings for which safety features are on or off, and activate them with just two button presses - much easier than diving through touchscreen menus. You can get the Austral with adaptive cruise control and traffic jam assist to make longer drives easier. You also get three ISOFIX points throughout the cabin, while there’s also airbags all around and an immobiliser. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems The Austral didn’t appear in the 2024 Driver Power owner satisfaction survey. Renault as a brand didn’t do brilliantly, though, ranking just 28th out of 32 brands. The Austral hasn’t been recalled and anecdotally there don’t seem to be any recurring issues, but keep an eye on owner reviews to see if any begin to crop up now that the car’s been out for a couple of years. Renault’s warranty is typical of alternatives at just three years and 60,000 miles of cover. However, opt for a Hyundai Tucson or Kia Sportage and you get five or seven years of warranty respectively, while the Toyota RAV4 has up to 10 years. The Austral gets a separate battery warranty of eight years and 100,000 miles, guaranteeing it to at least 67% - that’s typical of most alternatives. Renault Austral FAQs Renault Austral FAQs"
https://www.carwow.co.uk/renault/megane-rs,Renault Megane R.S. Review and Prices,"€48,609",6/10,new,"The Renault Megane R.S. is a seriously quick hot hatch which, like the Hyundai i30N, the VW Golf GTI and the Honda Civic Type R, comes with front, instead of four-wheel drive. Unlike the Honda, though, the Renault Megane R.S doesn’t look like a collection of boy-racer cliches haphazardly fixed to a hum-drum hatchback. Sure, it’s wider and lower than the standard Megane, but compared with the Batmobile-inspired Civic, the R.S.’ fake plastic grilles, central exhaust pipe and big wheels are almost subtle. Almost. Things do get a little bit lairy inside, where you’ll find uber-supportive sports seats, red details on the steering wheel and dashboard and even optional carbon-fibre effect fabric inserts on the dashboard and doors. They’re an acquired taste, but help make the Megane R.S.’ interior feel undeniably sporty. There’s the same slightly fiddly portrait infotainment screen and digital driver’s display as you get in the standard Megane, only here you’ll find a few tasty R.S. graphics and a less appetising engine revving sound which plays through the speakers when you unlock and open the door. The rest of the Renault Megane R.S.’ interior is less gimmicky. There’s space for four adults to get comfortable inside, or two adults in the front and three kids in the back. It’s easy to fit a child seat because every model has front and back doors as standard, and the boot’s just as roomy as the standard Megane’s so there’s space for some suitcases, the weekly shop or a large baby buggy. There aren’t many ways to personalise your Renault Megane R.S., but you can pick between the standard 280hp version in standard or Cup trim, and a 300hp model with the upgraded Trophy chassis. The most hard-core Trophy versions of the Renault Megane R.S. may be the fastest, but they’re also the most difficult to live with thanks to their super-firm suspension. This slightly confusing arrangement boils down to a choice of three cars. There’s an entry-level 280hp car with softer, less focussed suspension, a more hard-core 280hp model with upgraded suspension and a grip-boosting differential and a rip-roaring 300hp range-topper with the beefiest brakes, biggest wheels and stiffest suspension. All models come with a 1.8-litre turbocharged engine and the option of a six-speed manual or an automatic gearbox. The automatic ‘box is responsive but a little jerky at slow speeds, while the manual is more engaging, but a bit notchy – especially when you’re barrelling along a country road. Another thing that feels odd at first is the Renault Megan R.S.’ four-wheel steering feature. This helps make it as agile as a mosquito after a double espresso – especially in the sportiest Race driving mode – but also makes the steering feel flighty and the car prone to wandering at motorway speeds. Around town, the firm suspension transmits an unpleasant thud through your seat with every passing pothole and you’ll hear a distinct roar from the wide tyres at motorway speeds. This all contributes to making the Renault Megane R.S. quite tiring to drive for long periods. If you’re hoping this firm setup results in racing-car handling on an empty backroad, you might be a little disappointed. Sure, the Renault Megane R.S. is one of the most nimble hot-hatches around, but its aggressively quick steering and fidgety suspension don’t inspire a great deal of confidence – especially on uneven or unfamiliar roads. Even the hard-as-nails Civic Type R in its most focussed R+ mode is more at home leaping from one bend to another than the perennially unsettled R.S. If you plan to take your next hot hatch on regular track days, then the Renault Megane R.S. is well worth a look – especially in its most focussed Cup and Trophy configurations. But, if you plan to take it to work as well as the race track, you’ll be better off with the Civic Type R."

https://www.carwow.co.uk/renault/arkana,Renault Arkana Review & Prices,"€14,975",6/10,used,"Is the Renault Arkana a good car? Is the Renault Arkana a good car? If you fancy a sporty-looking coupe SUV, your only options used to be big, posh German cars like the BMW X4 and Mercedes GLC Coupe , but there are a couple of more reasonably-priced models out there now which offer similar sleek styling, one of these being the Renault Arkana. You can think of it as a slightly left-field alternative to cars such as the Skoda Karoq or the Nissan Qashqai . If those cars are a bowl of porridge for breakfast, the Arkana is more like a pain au chocolat. It may not be as sensible, but it’s a more exciting option. You may also be considering the Peugeot 408 , which has bolder styling. The front end will be familiar from other Renaults thanks to the C-shaped LED running lights, and you get LED headlights on mid-spec cars and up. It’s the side profile that really sets the Arkana apart, with a swoopy coupe-esque roofline lending it a sporty edge over alternatives. This may look cool, however it doesn’t do much for interior space. While those up front won’t have any trouble getting comfortable, thanks to plenty of adjustment in the seats and steering wheel, the back seats aren't quite so accommodating. Headroom is pretty limited and there’s not much in the way of legroom either. A Skoda Karoq is a better bet for carrying people on a regular basis. It may not be the most practical cabin, but at least it's well made. There are plenty of plush materials to be found, and everything feels well screwed together. The metallic feeling dials for the climate control are a particularly welcome addition, however, the interior doesn’t have quite the same design flair as a Peugeot 408. At 480 litres, the boot is a decent size. It’s slightly bigger than a Peugeot 408 hybrid, but it’s a lot smaller than a Citroen C5 X and there are no clever features like a 12-volt socket or some hooks for your shopping bags. As for interior cubby spaces, you get an average glovebox and some large door pockets, but that’s pretty much it other than a pair of cupholders and a small cubby under the armrest. What the Arkana lacks in interior space, it makes up for in standard equipment. Even entry-level Evolution models get a 7.0-inch touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto and rear parking sensors with a reversing camera, but if you step up to the Techno model you get a better-looking 9.3-inch screen. As for engines, you have a choice of one. The Arkana comes only with a 1.6-litre full hybrid. If you’re after a diesel SUV, you’re out of luck here. Take a look at the Citroen C5 Aircross instead. The 145hp hybrid system should return a claimed 60mpg, however a week with the car in a mixture of driving conditions saw us return an average of 44mpg. Behind the wheel the Arkana isn’t as sporty to drive as the styling would suggest. A Ford Kuga will put a bigger smile on your face. The suspension is also quite firm, so driving on broken roads can become tiring. The Arkana is at its best on the motorway. It’s pretty smooth at speed, however the bigger wheels on the Esprit Alpine model do generate a bit of tyre noise. The Renault Arkana may not be the most practical SUV on the market, however, it’s still worth considering if you're after a sporty-looking SUV with plenty of standard equipment and a decent price tag. Keen on making a Renault Arkana your next car? Check out the latest Renault Arkana offers available through Carwow, as well as the best deals on the Renault line-up as a whole. Plus, we've got a wide selection of used Renaults , and once you've picked your next car, you can sell your car through Carwow too. How much is the Renault Arkana? How much is the Renault Arkana? The Renault Arkana represents pretty good value for money, undercutting the Peugeot 408 by quite a big margin. It’s also slightly less expensive than the Citroen C5 X, however that car has more space on offer for the money. All cars get wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, cruise control and autonomous emergency braking, however you’ll want to step up to the Techno model for around £2,000 more to get a handful of useful equipment. This version gets a 9.3-inch touchscreen, up from the 7.0-inch screen you get as standard, a reversing camera, rear parking sensors, keyless entry and faux-leather upholstery. If you want luxuries such as heated seats and steering wheel, adaptive cruise control, electric seats and rear privacy glass, you’ll have to splash out just over £3,000 over the base price on the Esprit Alpine model. This also gets sporty styling upgrades and larger 19-inch alloy wheels, however this does drive the price up. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort The Renault Arkana is pretty economical, however visibility is poor and it’s not the most comfortable car in its class Driving in town is pretty stress-free in the Renault Arkana. It always starts in all-electric mode, meaning you can glide around in silence and it gets off the line at a decent pace. Handy for pulling out at busy junctions. You won’t want to hit any potholes or speed bumps at speed though, because the suspension is pretty firm. It’s not uncomfortable, but something like a Kia Sportage is more composed over broken surfaces. The option of a ‘B’ mode for the gearbox does make town driving a bit easier. The car will use regenerative braking when you lift off the accelerator to slow you down and put energy back into the battery. This is really useful, but when you do have to press the brakes they can be a bit grabby, with a light brush of the pedal slowing the car quite harshly. This can make low-speed manoeuvres awkward. What makes urban driving a real chore is the visibility. The windscreen is quite shallow, and the front Pillars are chunky which creates blind spots looking forward, while that sloping roofline means your view out of the back and over your shoulder is pretty poor. This means the reversing camera you get on Techno models and above is essential, but it’s not the best system out there. It’s quite a grainy image, so parking in the rain or at night can get difficult. There’s no option of a 360-degree camera either, something which would be really appreciated here. Things improve when you hit the motorway. It’s pretty comfortable once you start going faster, and the blind spot monitoring you get on Techno models compensates for the lack of over-the-shoulder visibility. There’s not much in the way of wind noise, although you do get a bit of tyre roar if you go for the Esprit Alpine model thanks to its larger wheels. The engine noise can get intrusive as well. It sometimes feels like you’re cruising at 70mph in third gear, with the engine revving too high and creating a lot of noise. If you spend a lot of time on the motorway, you might fancy adaptive cruise control to automatically keep you a safe distance from the car in front. Well this feature only comes on the top-spec Esprit Alpine model. All models do get standard cruise control. The Renault Arkana isn’t as sporty to drive on a twisty road as its coupe styling lets on. It feels secure and the steering is accurate enough, however it doesn’t really encourage you to push hard through the bends. Switching into sport mode doesn’t help either. The steering becomes a bit heavier and the throttle response is improved, but ultimately the Ford Kuga is the SUV to buy if fun is at the top of your wish list The suspension deals with uneven roads well enough, although you may find it a bit firm if comfort is your priority. You get quite a lot of engine noise through the cabin and it can feel slightly underpowered if you need to overtake a slower-moving vehicle. Space and practicality Space and practicality The Arkana has a decent-sized boot and plenty of room up front, however, those in the back will be wanting more space There's plenty of space in the front of the Renault Arkana, with loads of adjustment in the seats and steering wheel to help you find your ideal driving position. That said, the very tallest drivers may wish for a touch more headroom. The seats are supportive and comfortable enough, so tackling long slogs up the motorway is no bother at all, although you might struggle if you have long legs with a lack of thigh support. There are plenty of places to keep your drinks on the go as well, with two useful cup holders in the centre console and door bins that are large enough to fit a big flask. There’s also a handy tray in front of the gear lever with some USB charging ports for your mobile phone, as well as a small cubby under the armrest. The glovebox is a decent size, despite the fact that a chunk of it is taken up by the fuse box. It’s once you step into the back that you notice the biggest drawback of that sloping roofline. Knee room is okay, although not as generous as the Peugeot 3008, but headroom is pretty limited. Kids will be fine in the rear, and it’s easy to fit a child seat as well. The doors open nice and wide, and the ISOFIX anchor points are easily accessible, just try not to lose the removable plastic covers. Kids may also not like the high window ledges restricting their view out. Adults won't be quite so comfortable. Tall people will struggle for headroom, made worse when you try to carry three people. There’s a hump in the floor as well, meaning you may have to deal with squabbles over foot space. At least there is an armrest with a couple of handy cupholders, and the door bins are a good size as well. Those in the back are spoilt for choice with charging solutions as well, with two USB sockets and an old-fashioned 12-volt. The 480 litres of boot space you get in the Arkana is pretty average for a swoopy coupe SUV. It’s around nine litres more than you get in hybrid versions of the Peugeot 408, however it falls considerably short of the more traditionally-shaped Kia Sportage’s 526-litre capacity. The load lip is quite high on the Arkana, so hauling heavy suitcases is a bit tricky. At least there’s no drop down into the boot so you can just slide items straight out, unless you drop the false floor to its lowest setting. If you leave the floor raised up then there’s a handy amount of space underneath for hiding things away. When you fold the rear seats down they lay flat with no ridge, making the most of the 1,263 litres of space you’re left with. What’s not so good is the bulky load cover, which you can’t store in the car anywhere. This boot is lacking in any clever features. There are no hooks for shopping bags, no tie downs and no 12-volt socket. You get a light and that’s your lot. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories The Renault Arkana has a posh-feeling cabin with plenty of kit, it’s just not quite as snazzy to look at as some alternatives The Renault Arkana has an impressively solid cabin that could easily go toe-to-toe with German alternatives such as the Volkswagen T-Roc . There are plenty of soft-touch plastics on the dashboard and doors, and all the switchgear feels solid and is nicely damped. It’s not the most eye-catching cabin in this segment, that prize goes to the Peugeot 408, but there are still plenty of nice metallic flashes around and everything is logically laid out. There’s also ambient lighting throughout the cabin to lift things even further. You get physical dials for the climate controls, which are a welcome addition in a world of fiddly touch screen-based systems. All models get a multifunction steering wheel, although you’ll have to go for the Esprit Alpine if you want to have it heated. Entry-level cars get a small screen in front of the driver, whereas mid-spec cars and up get a larger 10.0-inch digital driver’s display. It’s pretty easy to read, however the displays aren’t that customisable like they are in a Kia Sportage. The infotainment screen is the dominant feature of the cabin. As standard, you get a 7.0-inch touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. All other models get an upgraded 9.3-inch screen with sat nav built in. It’s worth spending the extra for this bigger screen because the 7.0-inch one looks a bit puny. The system is easy enough to use and the menus are all simple to navigate, however the Arkana doesn’t get the same clever Google-based software you have in the Renault Megane E-Tech . As a result, it’s not quite as slick to use. The upgraded screen from Techno and Esprit Alpine models gets things like live traffic updates, meaning it can warn you of any upcoming jams and divert you around them. This works well enough, however, you’ll still be better off plugging your phone in and using Google Maps through Apple CarPlay or Android Auto. MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax There is just the one engine option for the Renault Arkana, a 1.6-litre E-Tech hybrid. There are no plug-in options to be found here, so company car buyers looking for the lowest tax rates will be better off going for something like a Citroen C5 X. The 142hp E-Tech hybrid emits 107g/km of CO2, meaning it sits in one of the lower tax bands. Renault claims this model will return around 60mpg, however a week with the car in varied driving conditions saw us return 44mpg on average. The E-Tech hybrid is economical enough for long-distance drivers, if you really want a diesel family car you’ll need to look at something like a Skoda Karoq. Safety and security Safety and security The Renault Arkana scored the maximum five stars in its Euro NCAP crash test, meaning the structure is excellent at keeping you and your occupants safe if the worst should happen. There’s plenty of safety kit on board as standard, including autonomous emergency braking, which can perform an emergency stop for you at low speeds if you don’t react in time, lane departure warning with lane keeping assist, as well as the usual plethora of airbags. All cars also get parking sensors and a reversing camera, while mid-spec models and up get rear cross-traffic alert and blindspot monitoring. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems All new Renault models are covered by a five-year warranty, which is above the three years offered by many manufacturers. This includes unlimited miles for the first two years, and then up to 100,000 miles thereafter. There are no reliability woes to report with the Arkana, although there was a recall at the beginning of 2022. There were 1,562 cars affected by this, and the issue relates to overheating of the electric power steering system. If you buy a Renault Arkana second-hand, check with your local dealer that the recall work has been done. If it hasn’t, the repairs won’t cost you anything."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/renault/captur,Renault Captur Review & Prices,"€29,829",8/10,new,"Is the Renault Captur a good car? Is the Renault Captur a good car? Small SUVs are everywhere - just take a look at your local supermarket car park - but not all are created equal. The Renault Captur is one of the most stylish options going, while remaining sensible and practical. Think of it as cafe-au-lait from a patisserie as opposed to a mug of instant Nescafe from a greasy spoon cafe; they both do the same job, but you feel fancier with a bit of foam on your coffee. As with coffees, there are loads of alternatives to the Captur available when considering a small SUV. From the super-efficient Toyota Yaris Cross and Lexus LBX to the rugged Dacia Duster and equally chic Peugeot E-2008 EV, the small Renault is far from alone in the market. A 2024 update gave the Captur a bold new design, with slim, angular headlights either side of a broad, blanked-off grille. Arrow-shaped LED running lights flank the front end, and while the rest of the car doesn’t have quite the same crisp styling, it’s still a handsome little thing. The interior isn’t quite as stylish, but the straightforward dashboard with some coloured trim and fabric upholstery on its leading edge is easy on the eye. The portrait-oriented infotainment screen sits proudly in the middle, though it sticks up high above the dash top, slightly awkwardly. It’s a great system though, standard on every trim bar the entry-level model. The Google-based software is very easy to use with in-built Google Maps, wireless Apple CarPlay / Android Auto . Just as easy to use is the row of toggle switches for the climate controls below the screen. There’s plenty of space inside the Captur, and the highly-adjustable driver’s seat and steering wheel make it easy to get comfortable in. Rear headroom is a little tight, but there’s an enormous boot which ranges from 484 litres to a cavernous 616 litres; the rear bench slides to give you more storage space or leg room, depending on your needs. You can choose from two engine options for the Captur: a 1.0-litre petrol engine equipped with a six-speed manual gearbox , or a more powerful 1.6-litre self-charging hybrid with an automatic transmission. It’s worth the extra spend to get the hybrid, as it’s highly efficient and the additional power is handy too. The engine kicks in smoothly when it’s required, but the hybrid system does a good job of using EV power alone when just pottering about. What’s not so smooth is the driving experience over bad roads, as the suspension is rather firm, bouncing you around over potholes and speed bumps. Light steering and good forward visibility mean the Captur is stress free to manoeuvre around town though - especially in the automatic hybrid model. Motorways are more comfortable as the suspension seems to settle down, but the petrol model feels underpowered when getting up to speed and there’s noticeable road noise on trim levels with the larger wheels. Country lanes aren’t exciting in the Captur, but there’s minimal body roll and the steering feels precise; it never feels unsettled on a twisty road. Check out Carwow’s new Renault Captur deals to get a stylish, easy to live with small SUV on your driveway, or look at Renault Captur lease deals to avoid paying a cash lump sum. You can find used Renault Captur deals through our network of trusted dealers, or other used Renault models to get a glimpse of the rest of the range. Carwow can even help you sell your car when you’re ready to make a change. How much is the Renault Captur? How much is the Renault Captur? Entry-level Capturs start at a hair over £22,000, but they don’t represent great value for money as they feel a bit…barren. Mid-range cars and above are much better value, coming equipped with the big, posh, portrait infotainment system as well as a 10.3-inch driver’s display, 360-degree parking sensors and electrically folding mirrors. Petrol-powered Capturs undercut the equivalent Volkswagen T-Cross and Skoda Kamiq by a few thousand pounds, but there’s less difference between the E-Tech Captur hybrid and the hybrid Toyota Yaris Cross. The Yaris Cross comes equipped with more kit than a mid-level Captur, so you’ll be paying more for the top-spec Esprit Alpine Captur to get as much equipment as on the Toyota. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort The Captur is easy to drive around town and it’s decent on the motorway, however the firm suspension makes it unsettled over harsher bumps and you’ll want to avoid the weedy 1.0-litre engine In town Piloting the Captur around town is a doddle thanks to its compact dimensions and light controls. Your view forward is great and the door mirrors are a decent size, but there is a blind spot over your shoulder thanks to the chunky rear pillars. All cars come with a reversing camera and rear parking sensors as standard which go some way to mitigate this, but it’s a shame that there’s no option of a 360-degree camera like you can have on the Toyota Yaris Cross. If you can spare the extra few thousand pounds then the E-Tech hybrid model is the one to go for. It can waft around town in electric-only mode at low speeds, and it does a great job of keeping engine use to a minimum to save fuel. There’s an E-Save button which will maintain the battery at 40% for you to use around town. The hybrid is also the only model which gets an automatic gearbox. While the hybrid system is great, the suspension isn't quite as refined over bumps as alternatives such as the Volkswagen T-Cross. The Captur feels a bit jiggly around town, something which is made worse by the 19-inch wheels you get on the range-topping Esprit Alpine model. However, to be fair, it's only really noticeable on poorer road surfaces with lots of potholes. On the motorway Things settle down on the motorway, although the body does roll around on especially undulating surfaces which could make your kids feel a bit travel sick. Wind noise is pretty hushed, with just a bit of rustling from the mirrors disturbing the peace. Joining a faster moving road can be a slight issue in the hybrid model, especially if it's a short slip road because it can be hesitant to give you power when you put your foot down. It’s still better than the 1.0-litre petrol though, because that car just feels underpowered. The road noise can be a bit intrusive if you have the Esprit Alpine model with its larger wheels, but this is also the only version which has adaptive cruise control, so you’ll have to weigh up which is more important to you. On a twisty road Venture out onto a country road and the Captur is best described as adequate. It’s not as much fun as a Ford Puma, but the steering is direct and there’s very little body roll. That lack of lean through the corners is thanks to the firm suspension, which does result in it being pretty uncomfortable on anything other than perfectly smooth roads. A Volkswagen T-Cross handles the bumps much better. Space and practicality Space and practicality You get a massive boot and decent passenger space in the Captur, although fitting three people in the back is a squeeze. Getting comfortable behind the wheel of the Captur is easy. There’s plenty of adjustment in the seat and the steering wheel, and you get adjustable lumbar support as standard. The driving position is good as well, offering a commanding view of the road. The range-topping Esprit Alpine model gets some lovely sports seats and, while they seem a bit out of place in a humble compact SUV, they provide great support on long journeys. The standard chairs are also nice and comfy. Interior storage is pretty so-so.The fuse box impedes on the glovebox, but it’s really deep so there’s still a decent amount of space. You also get a couple of cup holders and some trays in the centre console for your phone and any other loose bits and bobs you empty out of your pockets. The door bins are a decent size as well, with enough space to fit a big bottle of water. All cars get a wireless charging pad and two USB-C ports in the front to keep your phone charged up. Space in the back seats It’s a tale of two halves in the back of the Captur. Legroom is decent and headroom is okay as long as you’re not especially tall. Getting three across the back will be a struggle though because the middle seat is quite narrow, and it’s raised up so whoever sits there has little headroom. At least there's plenty of space for your feet. Fitting a child seat is fiddly because you have to unzip the covers for the ISOFIX anchors and then poke about to find the mounting points. However, the door opens nice and wide to make things easier and you have mounting points on the front passenger seat in case you want to keep your baby close by. It’s a shame that the rear passengers don’t get an armrest or any cup holders, they just have a pair of small door bins for a bottle and some nets on the front seat backs. Still, at least charging everyone’s devices is a breeze - there are two USB-C ports in the back and a 12-volt socket. Boot space The boot is where the Captur sets itself apart from other small SUVs, because it’s massive for a car this size. In the 1.0-litre petrol model you have 484 litres of space, 24 litres more than a Toyota Yaris Cross and it’s almost 30 litres bigger than a Volkswagen T-Cross. And this is before you make use of the Captur’s party piece, because the rear seats can slide forward to expand the boot to a whopping 616 litres. Unfortunately the boot does shrink quite a lot if you go for the hybrid version. You lose around 136 litres because of the electrical gubbins under the boot floor. This only affects the underfloor storage though, and the main boot area is a nice square shape with no load lip regardless which model you go for. The rear seats also fold completely flat with no step in the floor, so pushing heavy items to the front is a breeze. It would be nice if there were some clever features in the boot. You get a couple of hooks and that’s your lot, no 12-volt sockets or tie-down point here. The Skoda Kamiq is slightly more versatile in this respect, and if you want maximum boot space for the money then the Citroen C5 Aircross is worth a look. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories The Captur has a well-made and high-quality interior with some great tech, although the digital driver’s display could be better The fit and finish inside the Captur can easily match German alternatives like the Volkswagen T-Cross. Everything feels really nicely screwed together, and all the materials you touch or look at are soft and yielding. A Peugeot 2008’s cabin may look funkier, but the Captur still has a smart interior design. All versions come with a 10.4-inch touchscreen as standard, however you’ll want to go for the mid-spec version and up because then you get the brilliant Google-based software. The screen is bright and responsive and the graphics are great, and the layout looks pretty much the same as your phone’s so it’s really easy to use. This system also has things like Google Maps built in, and you can get Spotify as well. You don’t even need to pair your phone all the time, although you do still have wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto across the range. All but the entry-level car also have a 10.3-inch digital driver’s display, and it’s pretty good. All your vital driver information is clear and easy to read, and there are a few different views you can choose from to display things like your media or sat nav directions. The system you can get on a Volkswagen T-Cross is slightly more configurable, but there’s not much in it. MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax An update to the Captur in 2024 brought in a streamlined range of engines. There are now just two to choose from - a 1.0-litre turbocharged petrol with 90hp or or 145hp E-Tech hybrid . Company car drivers will be disappointed to learn that the plug-in hybrid model is no more, so you may want to look towards a Toyota C-HR if you want a plug-in hybrid car with lower Benefit in Kind rates, or you could get an all-electric MG4 for similar money which will sit in the lowest BIK tax bracket. The 1.0-litre petrol model is only available with a six-speed manual gearbox, and it’ll return up to 48mpg if you’re careful. The issue with this engine is that it’s a bit underpowered when you venture out onto faster moving roads. There are no such issues with the E-Tech hybrid, and this will be the engine of choice for most buyers. It can drive on electric power alone when you’re bumbling around town, and the engine cuts in and out smoothly when it needs to. It can be a bit hesitant when you want a sudden burst of acceleration, but other than that it’s pretty unobtrusive and a week spent with the car in various driving conditions saw us return 59mpg on average. Very impressive when the claimed figure is 61mpg. Safety and security Safety and security The Renault Captur underwent Euro NCAP testing and scored four stars - a downgrade from the pre-facelift car's five-star rating. This isn't a bad score, and it's worth noting some of the systems Euro NCAP deducts points for - such as the absence of a warning to avoid 'dooring' cyclists - aren't available on many of the Captur's alternatives. You get a decent amount of safety kit as standard. All cars come with automatic lights, rear parking sensors, a reversing camera, automatic emergency braking and driver attention alert. You do get cruise control as well, but an adaptive system is reserved only for range-topping cars. A Toyota Yaris Cross gets this as standard. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems Renault came a lowly 28th out of 32 manufacturers entered into the 2024 Driver Power reliability survey, which is hardly a confidence-inspiring result, though there haven’t been any horror stories of notable issues with the Captur. Renault offers an above average five-year/100,000-mile warranty though, with hybrid variants getting an additional eight-year/100,000-mile warranty on their hybrid components. Servicing costs are reasonable, with a three-year/30,000-mile plan available as a one-off cost or payable in monthly instalments. Renault Captur FAQs Renault Captur FAQs"
https://www.carwow.co.uk/renault/megane-sports-tourer,Renault Megane Sports Tourer Review and Prices,"€30,648",7/10,new,"Sadly, it’s an option on this Renault – but one we would highly recommend. Its 8.7-inch width is large for this class, especially when you consider its portrait style, and the detailed graphics are matched by no rivals. Sadly, the rest of the interior’s design fails to stand out – solidly built though it is – and it’s a bit of a let down given the sharp-suited exterior. It’s hard to complain about the space on offer, though. There’s room for four adults and the rear seats recline further back than in the Megane hatchback. But, given that this is the estate model, it’s the healthy 580-litre boot that will matter to most people – even if it’s outgunned by the 610-litre load bay in the Skoda Octavia estate. The Sport Tourer’s boot is full of useful features too: the floor height is adjustable, you get dividers to split up the space and hooks to keep your shopping upright. Those hooks may prove more useful than you might imagine if you go for the warm GT model that has four-wheel steering and a quick shifting EDC twin-clutch gearbox. The rest of the range is more on the relaxed side, making the Megane Sport Tourer one of the most comfortable in class. The GT model sports a 204hp 1.6-litre petrol engine that will be good for 0-62mph in close to seven seconds. Lower down the range you can choose between a nippy 130hp 1.2-litre petrol or two diesels – a 110hp 1.5-litre or a 130hp 1.6. Both the diesels can return fuel economy of around 70mpg. Standard equipment on entry-level Expression+ models includes a Bluetooth phone connection, DAB digital radio, a height adjustable driver’s seat, air-conditioning, and four electric windows. What it lacks in polish, the Megane Sport Tourer makes up for with stylish looks If you’re in the market for a new mid-size estate car and you’re the sort of person that likes traditional things such as Shepherd’s pie you may be a bit befuddled by the Megane’s nontraditional dashboard layout and concept-car looks. You might think this is some sort of foie gras that will taste a bit funny and not fill you up at all. However, the Renault Megane Sport Tourer isn’t a fancy French dish that’s only good to look at. Because it has things that are really important to get right in a family estate car such as a comfortable ride, one of the best touch-screen infotainment systems in class and a boot filled with practical features, the Sport Tourer is more like your traditional bangers and mash, but prepared by a Michelin star chef to look like something really special. So with all its talents, the Megane Sport Tourer is an even better proposition than its hatchback sibling and definitely should be near the top of your shortlist."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/renault/rafale,Renault Rafale Review & Prices,"€51,416",7/10,new,"Is the Renault Rafale a good car? Is the Renault Rafale a good car? The Renault Rafale is what happens when high-street brands start producing their own takes on designer fashion trends; looks great but it just isn't as posh as the bigger names. Think of it as a Weekday outfit to the Gucci BMW X4 and Hugo Boss Volvo EC40 . Yet for its size and body shape it’s not a direct alternative to either of those cars, sitting somewhere in between the Germans and the cheaper Peugeot 3008 or less stylish - and electric-only - Skoda Enyaq Coupe . It’s not just in its positioning where the Rafale stands out, but in its styling too. It’s a head-turning car, with a tall, imposing front end, flanked by a pair of arrow-shaped LED running lights. The broad grille, aggressive headlights, sporty silhouette and sleek rear-end all give the Rafale a hint of baby Lamborghini Urus about it, if you squint. The interior is rather posh at a glance, but once you settle in, it’s not as luxurious as appearances suggest. The two-tier dashboard has a full-width vent detail across the passenger side and a driver-facing, portrait-oriented infotainment system . It’s mounted in the same wrap-around, driver-facing trim panel as the digital instrument cluster - and while it looks great, the gloss black detailing and air vents feel a bit cheap to the touch. The leatherette and suede on the seats, dashboard and door trims feel lovely though, and most of the high-up plastics are of the soft-touch variety. Boot space is good, and while the plug-in hybrid model loses out on some boot space, the regular model has more boot capacity than a Peugeot 408 and Cupra Formentor . The parcel shelf feels flimsy, and the seats don’t fold completely flat either, which is annoying. You can choose from a 200hp self-charging hybrid powertrain or a more powerful, 300hp plug-in hybrid (PHEV), both with the same 1.2-litre engine under the bonnet. The more powerful engine suits the car’s character better, and it’s a great choice for company car buyers due to its low benefit-in-kind tax rate . Driving the Rafale is a mixed bag, because while the optional four-wheel steering and responsive controls make for good progress in town, it’s far too stiff over small bumps - and bouncy over big ones. The same applies to ruts and dips on the motorway, and the road noise is far too intrusive at speed. Country lanes are better, as the darty steering, lack of body lean and tremendous levels of grip from its huge tyres are all reassuring when hustling down a back road. It’s just a shame that the steering wheel doesn’t give you much sense as to what the front wheels are doing, and the 1.2-litre engine is gruff when accelerating. As a sporty, alternative choice to the typical German or Scandinavian fare, the Rafale is worth a look, and you can find new Renault Rafale deals on Carwow. There are Renault Rafale lease deals too, as well as used Renault Rafales available through our network of trusted dealers. For something a little smaller, there are other used Renaults for sale, and Carwow can even help you sell your car when it’s time to switch. How much is the Renault Rafale? How much is the Renault Rafale? There’s a notable difference in price between the entry-level, self-charging hybrid Rafale Techno and top-of-the-line Atelier Alpine trim level; over £11,000 in fact. Granted, Atelier Alpine cars can only be had with the more expensive plug-in engine option, but unless you really fancy the posh 21-inch wheels and clever electrochromic glass roof, it’s probably worth going for a mid-range Techno Esprit Alpine or Iconic Esprit Alpine instead. An issue for the Rafale is that it’s got some very capable alternatives, even if they’re not all that direct. The Peugeot E-3008 EV starts at around the same price as a mid-level Rafale, and while it’s not as big or spacious it’s far more comfortable. You can get an entry-level Tesla Model Y for a similar price too, or a Kia EV6 for another head-turning choice. The Rafale has its hybrid credentials going for it though, so if you’re not quite ready to take the full EV plunge then it might be the best bet for you. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort It’s quick and reassuringly grippy, but the Rafale just isn’t comfortable enough There’s no denying that the Rafale is a big old beast, but it doesn’t feel as unwieldy as it looks when you’re pottering around town. This is especially true on the upper trim level cars, which get a swish four-wheel steering system that cuts the turning circle down from 11.6 metres to a very impressive 10.4 metres instead - almost on par with a Renault 5 hatchback. You get plenty of shove in the plug-in model, even in EV-only mode. The self-charging hybrid isn’t exactly slow, but it doesn’t have quite the same pep in its step as the PHEV. It’s the suspension that really lets the Rafale down. While broken roads aren’t too bad, sharper potholes and bumps really thud through the cabin, and the big Renault bounces and lumbers over speedbumps. Visibility isn’t great either. The Rafale is easy to place on the move, but the rear pillars are gargantuan; combined with the small side mirrors and enormous 20-inch and 21-inch wheels, it’s a stressful car to park. Even the optional 360-degree cameras don’t help all that much when trying to get close to a curb. Getting up to speed is no issue in the Rafale, especially with the extra pace in the PHEV. The 1.2-litre engine does kick up a fuss when you’ve got your foot down, but it’s well insulated and barely noticeable once you’ve reached a cruise. Unfortunately, it’s not that refined otherwise. There’s enough road noise through the enormous wheel and tyre combos that you’ll actively seek out smoother sections of motorway to quieten it down, though wind noise is much more tolerable. The stiff, bouncy suspension is exaggerated at speed too. If you hit a bigger dip you can really feel the suspension get unsettled and bounce a few times before finding its groove again. Speaking of unsettled, the lane-keeping function of the active cruise control is frustrating. Motorway drives feel like you’re bowling with the gutter bumpers up, being bounced from lane to lane. It’s far more anxiety inducing than steering the car yourself, especially with a lorry in the lane next to you. The Rafale is impressively efficient though, as we achieved an average of 50mpg on a two-way motorway trip along the M1, with some country lanes and a little town driving thrown in the mix; good going for a big SUV . This is where the Renault Rafale makes the most sense, because the stiff suspension, quick steering and big tyres come together to make a rather accomplished car on a country lane. There’s no escaping the Rafale’s size and weight, but it feels very stable when being pushed along a winding road at speed. Sport mode sharpens up the steering and throttle response, and while you don’t have that much sense of what the front wheels are doing through the steering wheel, it makes up for it in directness. The Rafale isn’t a hugely fun or rewarding car to drive quickly, but there’s little in the way of body lean, and supportive seats mean you can carry plenty of speed around turns without hesitation. Space and practicality Space and practicality Surprisingly spacious for a swoopy coupe-SUV, but there are some odd quirks to the Rafale’s cabin Don’t let the coupe-SUV roofline fool you, there’s a lot of room in the Rafale. Lots of adjustability in the front seats and steering wheel make it easy to get comfortable, while there’s a good amount of storage space available. There are a pair of cupholders in the front of the centre console with some shallow space for odds and ends around them, while you can push the airplane-throttle-inspired handle-cum-wireless-charger forward to reveal a hidden, if awkwardly shaped, storage cubby. You can’t open it if you’ve got water bottles in the cupholders though, which is annoying. Another cubby behind it and deep, if narrow, felt-lined door bins are useful for holding larger items, but you can’t fit litre bottles in them - or the cup holders. There are a pair of USB-C chargers too, which is handy, but the glovebox cover feels cheap and flimsy. Rear passengers will be almost as comfortable as front seat occupants in the Rafale, with enough legroom to rival bigger, more expensive cars, and as much headroom as in a lot of non-coupe-SUVs . You’ll even fit three adults across with no complaints. The door cards have long, flat armrests which are comfortable to use, and the door bins are just as deep as the front ones. As far as storage goes, the Rafale’s party piece is its fold-down centre arm rest. It’s enormous, incorporating the rear headrest, meaning there’s room for a pair of cupholders as well as two felt-lined storage compartments. There are two USB-C ports within, on top of the two low down on the centre console, but there are also a pair of snazzy phone and tablet holders that rotate around the cup holders; perfect for keeping the kids entertained on a long drive. The Rafale’s boot capacity is 530 litres in the PHEV, but you get an additional 117 litres of underfloor storage in the self-charging hybrid - where the PHEV stores its batteries. It’s usefully square, but the loading edge is rather high up and annoying to dump heavy loads into. The lack of proper underfloor storage in the PHEV means there’s nowhere to store the charging cables out of sight, and the parcel shelf seems flimsy for what is an expensive car. There’s a useful 40:20:40 split for the folding rear bench, but the seats don’t fold totally flat; there’s a large edge to overcome when loading in bulky items. Four useful hooks and a 12-volt socket are handy though. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories There’s a degree of poshness in the cabin, but some scratchy plastics and infotainment quirks dull the shine At first glance, Renault has done a great job with the Rafale’s interior, especially in higher-trim level cars. The dashboard has a stepped design, with a half-width air vent detail across the passenger side trimmed in fabric or suede, and a set-back dash top with a strip of ambient lighting. The media and driver display screens are part of a gloss black unit that wraps around the driver’s side of the dashboard. It’s a sporty, futuristic-feeling layout, and while the design is slick it does look rather plastic-y in person, especially around the integrated air vents. The displays themselves are responsive and crisp, but the graphics themselves are overly fussy and not all that clear to navigate. There are also a few too many menus to work through, and there’s simply no need for adjusting the seats to have a pop-up animation which momentarily kicks you out of Apple CarPlay or Android Auto . It’s a little busy around the steering wheel, as there are three control stalks on the right hand side - all close to one another - as well as the shift levers. It does take a moment to make sure you’re turning on the wipers instead of selecting reverse or changing song. The gear selector itself isn’t sensitive enough as to whether or not you’ve got the brakes depressed, and it’s easy to find yourself creeping in the opposite direction to the one you want to go in unless you’re properly stamping on the left pedal. There are plenty of nice surfaces around you, and Renault’s use of fabric and suede trimming to elevate the cabin is very effective. There’s the odd hard plastic, but it's a generally pleasant cabin, and the optional electro-chromatic glass roof is achingly cool. MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax You’ve got two engine options to choose from with the Rafale, both powered by a 1.2-litre three-cylinder petrol engine. One is a 200hp, front-wheel drive self-charging hybrid, while the other is a 300hp, four-wheel drive plug-in hybrid. Both promise good fuel efficiency, and in our tests of the plug-in hybrid model we averaged a very respectable 50mpg on a motorway-heavy journey - with the car set to preserve battery at a cruise, too. The self-charging hybrid ought to be even more efficient on the move, though you don’t have the PHEV’s electric-only range, which comes in handy around town. It can even get up to motorway speeds on electric-only power, but you’ll have to drive like an absolute saint to get anywhere near the claimed 65 miles of battery range. Expect between 30-35 miles in the real world. The self-charging Rafale emits 105g/km of CO2, while the PHEV claims a weighted figure of 12g/km. That means £130 of first year road tax for the hybrid and £110 for the PHEV, though only the entry level Rafale hybrid escapes the luxury car tax which applies to new cars over £40,000. Company car drivers will be drawn to the PHEV model, as it sits in the fourth-lowest band of benefit-in-kind tax. Safety and security Safety and security The Renault Rafale is so closely related to the boxier Austral SUV that they share a five-star Euro NCAP result ; scoring especially well in the adult and child occupant categories. It comes as standard with a pair of rear ISOFIX child seat anchor points in the rear, with optional points in the front seat. All Rafales come as standard with lane departure assist, speed limit recognition and auto-adjustment, driver attention warning, emergency brake assist and blind spot warning too. There’s optional adaptive cruise with lane keep assist, and if the warnings are too annoying for you they’re easy to turn off too. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems It’s too new for any particular issues to have come to light, but Renault came a lowly 28th out of 32 manufacturers in the 2024 Driver Power owner satisfaction survey . Hardly a confidence inspiring result. The warranty is nothing to brag about either, with Renault offering the industry-standard three year/60,000-miles cover for the Rafale. Kia offers a seven warranty on the EV6 and the Lexus RX , though more expensive, offers ten years with regular main dealer servicing. PHEV Rafale batteries are warranted up to 100,000 miles or 8 years if their capacity drops below 75%, whilst self-charging hybrid models have to drop below 63% capacity before being eligible for replacement."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/renault/kadjar,Renault Kadjar Review & Prices,"€6,189",8/10,used,"Is the Renault Kadjar a good car? Is the Renault Kadjar a good car? The Renault Kadjar is the French firm’s contender in the big-selling family SUV category. These cars sell in huge numbers these days because they’re more spacious than a conventional hatchback with a higher driving position, although they cost a bit more to run. Think of the Renault Kadjar as a Nissan Qashqai with a little more je ne sais quoi and you won’t go far wrong, because underneath it shares much of its running gear with the Japanese car. The Renault Kadjar looks a lot more imposing on the outside than a hatchback such as the VW Golf or Renault Megane . It comes with large alloy wheels, a smattering of chrome trim and plenty of contrasting black trim on the bumpers and wheel arches so it’ll have no trouble standing out on the school run. Sadly, the Renault Kadjar’s interior isn’t quite as eye-catching as that in some other SUVs. Sure, it has plenty of soft plastics and a few brushed metal trims, but the Kia Sportage looks more exciting while the VW Tiguan feels more solidly put together. It comes with a good deal of equipment though, you get a digital driver’s display as standard, alongside a touchscreen infotainment system. It all looks pretty flash, but using the built-in sat nav is a bit trickier than in alternatives – a bit like paying for something with cash rather than using your contactless bank card. At least you’ll be sitting comfortably while you fiddle with the Renault Kadjar’s touchscreen. You get plenty of seat and steering-wheel adjustment as standard and there’s enough space for you to stretch out if you’re tall. It’s a similar story in the back where there’s room for three adults, but you don’t get any clever sliding seats like in the Skoda Karoq . The boot’s roomy enough for everyone’s luggage, though, and the flat boot floor makes it easy to slide in heavy luggage. There’s a 138hp petrol engine which provides a good mix of performance and efficiency, and you can option it with an automatic transmission rather than the manual to help take the stress out of town driving. Whichever transmission you pick, you’ll find the Renault Kadjar is pretty comfortable to drive. It doesn’t quite iron out bumps as well as the Nissan Qashqai, but it’s more relaxing than the Kia Sportage and Hyundai Tucson and doesn’t lean a great deal in tight corners. Unfortunately, the Kadjar is a little noisy to drive at motorway speeds. This isn’t because of its engine, rather you’ll hear quite a lot of wind and tyre noise. To help make things a bit more relaxing, you can get it with a range of driver assistance systems from automatic emergency braking and cruise control to lane-departure warning. All this makes the Renault Kadjar pretty easy to live with every day. It’s certainly an SUV that’s well worth considering if you’re looking for something that’s easy to drive, practical and pretty well equipped. Head over to the deals page to find some great deals on a brand new SUV , and if you're wanting a used Renault Kadjar then we have a great range of second-hand ones to choose from. How much is the Renault Kadjar? How much is the Renault Kadjar? The Renault Kadjar is priced competitively compared to its logical alternatives. It is within a couple of pounds of the ever-popular Nissan Qashqai with which it shares its underpinnings, as well as the spacious SEAT Ateca . The Hyundai Tucson and Peugeot 3008 are a few thousand pounds more in base trim but do offer snazzier looks and more impressive tech as standard. Seeing as the Kadjar is more about comfort and value than having the latest cutting-edge tech, we would stick with the base Equilibre trim. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort The Renault Kadjar offers a comfortable ride and great driving position. Just don’t expect much excitement when it comes to the driving experience The Kadjar is great around town, is comfortable and the elevated driving position aids visibility. The view out the sides and rear is good too, and both trims come standard with surround parking sensors as well as a rearview camera. Emergency brake assist is also fitted to all trims. The manual gearbox works well, although the seven-speed automatic may be better suited to stop-start driving. Like many dual-clutch transmissions, it can feel a little hesitant when parking, though. The Kadjar is spacious and comfortable on the motorway, and the 138hp engine offers reasonable performance, although there is a bit more wind noise than you get in the Nissan Qashqai or Kia Sportage. If you opt for the range-topping Techno trim, its larger 19-inch wheels can also transmit quite a lot of road noise into the cabin. Standard equipment that helps make motorway trips a bit more comfortable and safer include cruise control and lane departure warning, while the Techno trim also gets blind spot warning and LED front fog lights with a cornering function. The Renault Kadjar is a family SUV with no sporting pretensions, it feels solid and composed along a twisty road but there is not much fun to be had while driving it. There isn’t much body lean in corners, which will keep your passengers happy. For most owners, the Kadjar’s laid-back driving feel should be just right. Space and practicality Space and practicality The Kadjar has plenty of room for passengers and their effects, the boot is decently sized, too. But it’s not quite as practical as some alternatives The front seats in the Kadjar will fit most shapes and sizes, the driver’s seat comes standard with height adjustment and lumbar support, although the passenger seat only gets height adjustment on the higher Techno trim. The seats are comfortable, though, and there’s plenty of head and leg room even for the tallest occupants. The steering wheel offers both rake and reach adjustment. A sliding front centre armrest can take some bulkier items, although the door bins and glovebox aren’t quite as generously proportioned as in some alternatives. The central cup holders are also a bit too small for the largest big-gulp coffee cups, and you may inadvertently bump your drinks while changing gear. The rear seats are also spacious enough for tall adults, the centre seat is fine for smaller passengers but there is a small hump in the footwell which impacts on passenger legroom. ISOFIX mounting points are provided in the outer two seats, and there are front seatback pockets and a set of door bins for storage. The centre seat folds down to reveal a set of cupholders as well. Rear air vents are standard on both trims. The 472 litres of boot space behind the rear seats trails alternatives like the SEAT Ateca (510 litres), Skoda Karoq (521 litres) and Volkswagen Tiguan (520 litres), but the Kadjar makes the most of what’s available thanks to an adjustable boot floor and no frustrating boot lip to contend with. The rear seats fold down flat using handy levers, extending the loading space to 1,472 litres, once again not class-leading but it’s practical enough with tether points and various hooks to secure your bags with. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories The Renault Kadjar has a simple and logically laid out interior, with decent quality materials, but it is starting to look a bit dated now compared to more modern alternatives The Kadjar is offered in Equilibre and Techno trims, with the main difference being that the higher trim gets a synthetic leather and cloth seat covering instead of the fabric used on the base trim. Regardless of the trim level, the Kadjar’s interior looks well-made and most surfaces are covered in decent quality fabrics and plastics. A few bits of trim in the footwell and the centre console don’t match up to posher alternatives like the VW Tiguan, but it’s definitely not a low-rent interior. The styling is very conservative compared to alternatives like the Kia Sportage and Peugeot 3008. You get a digital driver display and infotainment touchscreen as standard, but it just doesn’t look quite as modern and slick as in some other family SUVs. There is some benefit to be had for not going with the herd though, the physical knobs for the climate control system are a welcome change from the frustrating touch sensitive controls that are becoming more commonplace. The large icons on the 7.0-inch touchscreen are also easy to use while on the move, and you get Bluetooth connectivity, DAB digital radio and sat nav as standard. If you prefer to use your phone's own apps, then you can also connect via Apple CarPlay and Android Auto . Responsiveness can be a bit slow, and most alternatives now offer much larger displays as standard. The digital driver display is clear and simple to read, although it doesn’t offer much integration with the infotainment system and has limited configurability. A small storage shelf in the base of the dashboard comes with some USB ports, and you get another pair in the rear to charge your devices. MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax The Kadjar engine range used to include a number of options but has now been whittled down to just one choice. It is the TCe 140, a 138hp turbocharged petrol engine which offers an official fuel economy figure of 44.8mpg. The manual transmission model will do the 0-62mph sprint in 9.8 seconds, with the automatic a few tenths quicker. It copes well around town but does need a bit of prodding when fully laden on the motorway. Those figures are comparable to the mechanically similar entry-level engine found in the Nissan Qashqai and match up well to the Peugeot 3008 and Kia Sportage. What the Kadjar doesn’t offer are more powerful alternatives or hybrid power like you get in the Sportage and 3008. The company car Benefit in Kind tax rate is 33% at time of writing, while the CO2 emissions are 140-141g/km. Safety and security Safety and security The Renault Kadjar received a Euro NCAP rating of five stars in 2015, although this rating has since expired. There’s no telling how it would fare under today’s harsher testing methods, but it does come equipped with a decent amount of passive and active driver aids. Keyless entry, emergency brake assist, lane departure warning, cruise control, surround parking sensors and a rearview camera are standard on both trims. The top Techno trim also gains an active emergency braking system, blind spot warning and full LED headlights. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems The Renault Kadjar has undergone six recalls since it was released, these have included potential airbag issues and problems with child locks and engine and braking efficiency. Some owners have reported issues in their first years of ownership, indicating that the Kadjar’s reliability is potentially not up there with the best offerings in this class. Any issues should be covered under the impressive five-year/100,000-mile warranty, though. And aside from some niggling issues, the Kadjar’s low running costs were commended. Servicing plans are available, with three-year/30,000-mile or four-year/40,000-mile options. Servicing intervals vary, depending on your driving style, with the first one due on or before 18,000 miles at either 12 or 24 months."

It’s an imposing car to look at – it’s 20mm wider than the car it replaces and comes as standard with two-tone paint and blingy 20-inch alloy wheels that look, well, fantastic! Those looks couldn’t come at the expense of practicality, though, so the Renault has a big boot, cubbyholes and under-seat bins that provide 63 litres of storage and one of the most elaborate gloveboxes we have ever seen. The engine range is extensive, too. Buyers can choose from five diesels, two petrols and a diesel-electric hybrid that returns fuel economy of 80.4mpg. Petrols are manual only, but diesels are available with a six-speed manual or a dual-clutch auto with the same number of gears. All models come with emergency city braking that works at speed of up to 31mph and can detect people (a class first), cruise control, two Isofix child-seat mounting points, a height adjustable driver’s seat and a Bluetooth phone connection. If you like the look of an SUV, but don't need the high ride height, the Scenic is perfect for you The Renault Espace was arguably the first MPV ever made and that expertise shows in this new Scenic. There’s much to like here, not least its cheap running costs and practical interior. Sure, the VW Touran is better to drive and the Citroen C4 Picasso is more comfortable, but the Scenic – much like the Espace – offers something genuinely unique here – stylish looks that don’t punish you for needing a practical car."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/citroen/c3-origin,Citroen C3 Origin Review & Prices,"€23,792",6/10,new,"Is the Citroen C3 Origin a good car? Is the Citroen C3 Origin a good car? The Citroen C3 Origin is a stylish alternative to small cars such as the Vauxhall Corsa or Kia Rio . If those cars are a practical rucksack, the C3 Origin is more like a funky messenger bag. You might be curious about the 'Origin' part of this car's name. For most of its life, this car's been known simply as the C3, but Citroen wants to reserve this name for the upcoming all-electric e-C3 . This version of the C3 has thus been renamed the C3 Origin so it can stay on sale for a few more months, filling the gap in Citroen's model line for an inexpensive hatchback. The exterior has a bit more style then your standard city car, and there are plenty of personalisation options on offer such as two tone paint and various decals to help you stand out. The stylish bag theme carries over to the interior, where you have some leather-looking straps to close the door. Some models come with wood-effect trim on the dashboard as well, and it’s a welcome addition to the otherwise quite drab-looking cabin. The material quality isn’t up there with the likes of the Volkswagen Polo either. There are a lot of scratchy plastics around the place, and bits of the cabin feel flimsy. That said, the C3 Origin is more affordable than the Polo, and you do get a decent amount of equipment. All models get air conditioning, Bluetooth connectivity for your phone and cruise control . All but the entry-level car also get a 7.0-inch touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto . Space in the front of the C3 Origin is decent. There’s a good amount of adjustment in the seats, and the steering wheel can be moved for reach and height. That said, taller drivers may be left wanting a bit more legroom. The front seats are like big, comfy armchairs. They’re soft and yielding, although there’s not much lateral support to hold you in place through the bends. Things aren’t quite so comfortable in the back though. Headroom is average (and even tighter if you have the optional panoramic roof), and the C3 Origin lags behind the Skoda Fabia for legroom. In terms of interior cubbies, the C3 Origin has some decent-sized door bins and a storage area with some cup holders in front of the gearstick. There is also a slot for your mobile phone below the infotainment screen, but it’s not really big enough for larger phones with the cable attached. The small glove box is the only real let-down in terms of cabin storage. The C3 Origin has a 300-litre boot. That’s a touch smaller than the Peugeot 208 and Vauxhall Corsa, and it’s considerably less space than you get in the Volkswagen Polo. It is a bit bigger than the Ford Fiesta ’s though, and there’s plenty of space for the weekly shop or a pushchair. On the road you can tell that this car is geared towards comfort over driving thrills. It’s not as much fun to drive as a Seat Ibiza or Ford Fiesta, but the soft suspension means it deals with bumps very well, and it’s also pretty quiet on the motorway. Engine-wise, you have a choice of two 1.2-litre petrols and a 1.5-litre diesel. The more powerful of the two petrols, with 110hp, is the best all-rounder, offering zippy performance and decent economy. The 84hp petrol is a bit lethargic out of town, but perfectly capable within it. The diesel is a bit more expensive, and only really worth considering if you spend a lot of time on the motorway. There are more practical small cars out there, and the Citroen C3 Origin isn’t the most fun to drive either, but if neither of those things matter to you then it’s a comfortable and good-looking option which offers more kit for the cash than a lot of alternatives.

And if you’re selling your current car, see how you can do that through carwow too. How much is the Citroen C3 Origin? How much is the Citroen C3 Origin? The Citroen C3 Origin undercuts a lot of its alternatives on price, but it’s worth noting that the entry-level model is sparsely equipped. Even when you step up to the mid-spec version it’s still quite a bit cheaper than the equivalent Ford Fiesta and Volkswagen Polo . Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort The Citroen C3 Origin is pretty comfortable for a small car and it’s easy to manoeuvre in town, however it’s not the most fun hatchback to drive The Citroen C3 Origin is the most at-home in town. Its small size makes it easy to squeeze into tight parking spaces, you have decent all-round visibility and the steering is nice and light. There is a bit of a blind spot over your shoulder, however all but the entry-level car gets a reversing camera to help mitigate this while parking. That entry-level model doesn’t have parking sensors either, so if you’re not too confident in car parks, you’ll want one of the higher trim levels. The suspension also does a great job of dealing with broken city streets. It irons out potholes nicely, and you have to hit a bump pretty hard before it sends a thump through the cabin. The best engine to go for is the 110hp 1.2-litre petrol because it’s nippy and economical. If you only drive in town, the 82hp version will also be fine, but bear in mind that it’s not available with an automatic gearbox, if that is important to you. That said, the auto isn’t the best – it’s slow to respond when you put your foot down, and hesitant and jerky when changing gear. Go for the manual version and the clutch is light, although the gear change feel a bit sloppy and the Ford Fiesta has a more slick shift. The brakes also feel pretty grabby, with a light brush of the pedal bringing you to an abrupt halt, which can make smooth progress tricky. The C3 Origin holds its own on the motorway. It feels pretty stable for such a small car, and the cabin remains nicely hushed at high speeds. You do get a slight rustling from the door mirrors, but that’s about it. The suspension continues to perform well here too, with the soft setup keeping everything smooth and comfortable. You can get buffeted around by strong winds, however this is to be expected in a small hatchback. All cars get cruise control to help take the strain out of long trips, however it’s not an adaptive system, which makes it less useful in heavy traffic. If you spend the majority of time on the motorway, you might want to consider the 1.5-litre diesel engine for its improved economy. The 82hp petrol feels out of its depth when things get faster, running out of puff pretty quickly, but the 110hp is a good all-rounder. It’s when you hit a country road that the comfy suspension shows its flaws. The C3 Origin’s body leans in the corners and the light steering doesn’t offer much in the way of feel. A Ford Fiesta is a lot more fun to drive. The 110hp 1.2-litre engine is the best choice for country road driving. It offers enough power for overtaking as long as you’re willing to rev it hard, although it’s a bit noisy when you do. If all you want is something to waft you home in comfort, the C3 Origin does this pretty well. It irons out imperfections in the road nicely and it’s quite relaxing to drive. Just don’t expect it to be in any way thrilling. Space and practicality Space and practicality The Citroen C3 Origin offers a decent-sized boot and finding your ideal driving position is reasonably straightforward. Those in the back will be less comfortable though, thanks to a lack of legroom The front seats of the Citroen C3 Origin are impressively comfortable for such a small car. They’re more akin to soft armchairs really, although there’s not much in the way of side support to hold you in place through corners. That said, you can spend hours sitting in them and you’ll get out feeling fresh. Finding your ideal driving position is pretty easy as well. The steering wheel can adjust for height and reach which is handy, although there is no height adjustment for the driver’s seat. Exceptionally tall drivers may also find that the seat doesn't quite go back far enough. As for cubby spaces, they’re fairly average in the C3 Origin. There are some cupholders in front of the gear lever with a small slot for your phone above this, although those with larger phones may find they don’t fit. You also only get half a glovebox, with the other half taken up by the fuse box. Rear seat room is not the Citroen C3 Origin’s strong suit. Headroom is pretty tight, something which is made worse if you go for the optional panoramic glass roof, and leg room isn’t particularly generous either. A Skoda Fabia is better for carrying people in the rear. It’s okay for carrying three in the back though. The middle seat is nice and wide, there’s adequate shoulder room for such a small car and there’s plenty of room for everyone's feet in the wide footwells. If you need to carry smaller passengers, this is straightforward as well. The C3 Origin is only available as a five-door, and the rear doors open plenty wide enough to get a child seat through with little faff. The ISOFIX anchor points are also easily accessible. What's not so easily accessible is USB sockets to charge your devices, because there are none in the back. In fact, there’s only one USB charging port in the whole car. What you do get in the rear are decent-sized door bins, but that’s your lot really. The pay-off for the below-par rear seat space can be seen in the boot, because it’s a generous size for a small car. You get 300 litres of space with the rear seats in place. That’s eight litres more than a Ford Fiesta’s boot, and it trumps the Suzuki Swift by 35 litres. It’s not quite as big as the Dacia Sandero though, that car offers 328 litres of space. While you get a good amount of space, there aren’t many clever features in the boot aside from a couple of tie-down points. A couple of shopping bag hooks or a 12-volt socket wouldn’t go amiss. Loading and unloading your luggage is also made more difficult by the big load lip to lift stuff over. Unlike in the Volkswagen Polo, there’s no option of a false floor to flatten this out so it’s something you’ll just have to put up with. Fold the back seats down and you have 992 litres of space. That’s actually around 100 litres less than the Fiesta, and it’s almost 200 litres smaller than the Skoda Fabia’s load area. The lack of a false floor comes back into play here as well because the seats don’t lie completely flat, meaning there’s a big ridge in the floor to haul heavy items over. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories The Citroen C3 Origin has a quirky-looking cabin with plenty of nice design touches to help it stand out, however the build quality and dated infotainment system let it down The overall design of the Citroen C3 Origin’s cabin is pretty nice and there are some funky touches which help it stand out. You get some leather-effect straps to pull the door closed, and you can choose between wood or Alcantara trim on the dashboard. Once you start prodding around though, you’ll find that the materials themselves are actually quite flimsy, especially when compared to something like a Renault Clio . Most of the plastics are hard and scratchy, although you do get some padding on the door armrests for added comfort. The base-spec Citroen C3 Origin just gets a black and white central screen with DAB radio and Bluetooth connectivity for your phone. All other models get a 7.0-inch touch screen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. It’s an okay system to use. It can be a bit slow to respond, and some of the menus are a tad confusing, but if all you do is plug in your phone it’ll be fine. What’s not so good is the fact that all of the climate settings are controlled through this screen. There are some shortcut buttons for things like demisting the window, but actually adjusting the temperature and fan speed on the move can be frustrating when you’re stabbing away at the relatively small on-screen buttons. If you want built-in sat nav then you’ll have to go with the top-spec Shine Plus version, however it doesn’t work as well as the navigation apps you can get on your phone so it’s not really worth upgrading just for this feature. MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax The Citroen C3 Origin is available with two petrol engines. They’re both 1.2-litre units, one with 83hp and the other with 110hp. You can also have a 1.5-litre diesel with 102hp, however this is only available on the top-spec car. The lower powered petrol is only available with a manual gearbox, as is the diesel. If you go for the 110hp petrol, you get a six-speed automatic gearbox as standard, with the manual version only available in range-topping Shine Plus trim. If you do most of your driving in town, the 83hp petrol will be sufficient. It has enough punch for nipping around city streets, although you may find it runs out of puff at higher speeds. The 110hp petrol is the best all-rounder, as it offers a good blend of performance and economy. The diesel is only really worth considering if you do a lot of motorway miles and need the better fuel economy because it’s more expensive to buy than the petrols. It’ll return a claimed 71mpg, compared to 54mpg from the 83hp petrol and 51mpg from the 110hp petrol. Those looking for the lowest company car tax will want the 110hp petrol as it’s the lowest-polluting engine. That said, the lack of any hybrid options may steer company car buyers towards something like a Renault Clio. Safety and security Safety and security The Citroen C3 Origin scored four out of five stars in its 2017 Euro NCAP safety tests, with one star being knocked off due to a lack of standard driver assistance features. The actual structure of the car should protect you pretty well should the worst happen. You do get lane departure warning as standard, as well as cruise control, however you have to step up to the mid-spec car if you want a reversing camera. Only top-spec cars get front collision warning and auto high beams. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems Overall, there are no major reliability issues to report with the Citroen C3 Origin and most owners report them to be dependable cars. All new Citroen models come with a three-year/60,000 mile warranty for added peace of mind. This is pretty standard for a lot of brands, however it’s not as generous as the five-year warranty you get with the Hyundai i20 or the seven-year coverage of the Kia Rio."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/citroen/spacetourer,Citroen SpaceTourer Review and Prices,"€51,158",6/10,new,"The Citroen SpaceTourer is a very practical MPV with enough space in its van-shaped body for as many as nine people. If you don’t fancy moonlighting as a minicab driver, you can get it with five seats and an absolutely vast boot. Unlike the similarly named Citroen C4 SPaceTourer, the non-C4 model isn’t a stylish MPV with space-age looks. Instead, the Citroen SpaceTourer is a boxy van-based MPV with unassuming styling and a back-to-basics cabin. In this sense, it’s quite similar to the Peugeot Traveller – both come with a very high roof and large rear doors that slide rather than swing open to help passengers climb in easily. Speaking of passengers, you can carry between four and eight friends in the Citroen SpaceTourer, depending on how many seats you choose to have fitted. Even in nine-seater mode, there’s enough space for tall adults to get comfy and even those in the rearmost seats won’t feel too claustrophobic thanks to the Citroen’s large windows. Not convinced? You can also get mid-range models with a panoramic glass roof to let even more light into the back seats. Even with most of your extended family onboard there’s plenty of space left over in the Citroen SpaceTourer’s boot for a few suitcases. You won’t feel left out in the front either, because there’s plenty of head and legroom and you get a 7-inch touchscreen infotainment system to keep you occupied in all but entry-level models. You won’t buy the Citroen SpaceTourer because it looks great or feels posh, but you might part with your cash if you need to carry eight friends and their luggage without breaking the bank. Sure, it doesn’t look as sharp or as colourful as the system you get in a Mercedes V-Class, but it comes with a DAB digital radio and lets you connect your phone using Bluetooth and MirrorLink so you can use your phone’s navigation apps through the Citroen’s built-in screen. All the Citroen SpaceTourer’s controls feel reasonably solid, but the more expensive Mercedes V-Class has it beaten in terms of both build quality and plush-feeling materials. You sit just as high up in the Citroen SpaceTourer as in the Mercedes V-Class though, so you get an equally commanding view out over other cars. The Citroen’s steering is fairly light too, so it isn’t particularly taxing to manoeuvre through city streets on in heavy traffic. It doesn’t feel quite as perky as the more powerful V-Class when you accelerate hard, though, but most of the Citroen SpaceTourer’s 1.6- and 2-litre diesel engines are still punchy enough to pull you and eight friends along at a reasonable lick. The Citroen’s slightly more economical than the Mercedes, but is a little noisier at motorway speeds. To help make it a bit more relaxing to drive, you’ll want to pay extra for the optional adaptive cruise control and automatic emergency braking upgrade. This also helps make the Citroen SpaceTourer safe, and well worth a second look if you’re after a very practical MPV – especially if you need to carry as many as eight passengers. Check out our Citroen SpaceTourer deals to see how much you can save on one."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/citroen/e-c4-x,Citroen e-C4 X Review & Prices,"€38,425",7/10,new,"Is the Citroen e-C4 X a good car? Is the Citroen e-C4 X a good car? The Citroen e-C4 X is an electric car that doesn’t fit easily into one category. Like the petrol-powered C4 X , it’s quite an unusual combination of traits, merging the high ride height of an SUV, the silhouette of a coupe, the price tag of a small hatchback and the saloon boot of, well, a saloon. It’s a bit like an old cottage that’s been refurbished, adapted, built on and extended until there’s not much of the original left - while the e-C4 X is related to the regular Citroen C4 hatchback , it’s a very different proposition. The e-C4 X, like the rest of the Citroen C4 range, got a mid-life facelift in 2024. The most noticeable change is to the front-end styling, which is much sleeker than it was before and features multi-level LED daytime running lights and narrow LED headlights. Though it’s not exactly handsome, it’s distinctive, and from the rear three quarter it’s almost elegant. Citroen’s new, much larger badge leaves you with no confusion about what brand it’s from. As an electric family car, there are a lot of excellent alternatives to the Citroen e-C4 X that you might be considering. Budget offerings such as the MG4 or great electric SUVs such as the Kia EV3 spring to mind, but finding a direct alternative isn’t easy because of the Citroen’s unique silhouette. Other electric saloons on sale tend to be more luxurious offerings such as the BMW i5, though the Tesla Model 3 is a good-value alternative. Inside, the e-C4 X is very similar to the rest of the C4 family. Since the 2024 facelift, it gets a new, posher infotainment screen and higher-quality digital dial display, but the bones of the cabin are the same - which means you get plenty of physical switchgear for ease of use, a simple and quite classy design and surprisingly good build quality for such a cheap car. Space for passengers is nearly identical, with rear seats that are just slightly reclined from the C4 hatch, but the boot is totally different. At 510 litres in capacity, it’s massive, but being a saloon car with a fixed rear window you lack flexibility for carrying larger items. The e-C4 X is fitted with Citroen’s ‘Advanced Comfort’ suspension, which has clever hydraulic elements. All you really need to know is that it deals with lumps and bumps in the road very well, taking the edge off speed humps and potholes in a way that most cheap cars don’t. There are two battery and motor combinations available for the Citroen e-C4 X, linked to the trim level you select. Base-model Plus variants (the even cheaper ‘You!’ model available on the standard C4 isn’t an option here) get a less powerful motor and a battery capable of up to 221 miles between charges (officially). Meanwhile, the top-spec Max model gets a larger battery and more powerful electric motor, good for up to 262 miles between charges and with improved performance. Both models are as smooth and quiet to drive as all electric cars, but while they’re nippy enough around town you don’t ever really feel a surge of acceleration like you do in a Tesla Model 3. Combined with the e-C4 X’s soft suspension, this is a car better suited to relaxing drives rather than extracting every drop of performance down a back road. If all this sounds good, check out our best Citroen e-C4 X deals . You can also see other great Citroen deals , or if you’re buying secondhand, find a used Citroen e-C4 X for sale or see other used Citroen cars for sale . And remember that Carwow can even help you to sell your old car when the time comes. How much is the Citroen e-C4 X? How much is the Citroen e-C4 X? With prices starting at just over £27,00 the Citroen e-C4 X is impressive value for what’s actually quite a large car. It’s comparable in price to models like the much smaller MG4, BYD Dolphin or Vauxhall Corsa Electric. And it’s not as if it’s particularly poorly-equipped for that price, with even the Plus model getting a 10.0-inch touchscreen with built-in sat-nav, LED headlights, climate control, a 360-degree camera and wireless smartphone connectivity plus a wireless phone charger. Stepping up to Max trim brings you heated front seats and steering wheel plus some extra driver assistance kit. A nice touch is that you get the same alloy wheels between both models, so there’s no visual clue that you’ve gone for the cheaper model. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort The Citroen e-C4 X is incredibly quiet and comfortable, but it’s not particularly thrilling on a twisty road The Citroen e-C4 X feels quite large but at no point is it intimidating to drive around town. The light steering is welcome here and it means that navigating narrow streets is easy enough. You have a choice of three drive modes: Sport, Normal and Eco. Even in normal the motors can be quite slow to pick up the pace, which takes some getting used to when darting into a gap in traffic. Eco is lethargic and should only be used when you really need to eke out some extra range. Sport does sharpen up responsiveness, but feels antithetical to the car’s character. Opting for the more powerful motor gives you a little more get-up-and-go, but not much. Rear visibility is okay, but the chunky pillars do limit the view over your shoulder somewhat. It’s an improvement over the regular e-C4, though, and the raised driving position gives you a good view of the road ahead, even if you do sit lower than in most traditional SUVs. We found the brakes a bit too light, though. Slightly firmer resistance would make it easier to come to a smooth halt. And if you’re a bit too eager with the pedal the soft suspension makes the car lurch forward slightly as you stop. Entry-level models get a standard safety pack with active braking, lane-keep assist and forward collision, but Shine and Shine Plus get some more advanced active braking tech and extended traffic sign recognition. Once again, that Advanced Comfort Suspension comes into its own. At higher speeds you find the car just rolls with the road and is rarely upset by broken Tarmac. If we’re being overly critical, that floating sensation can make it feel like the car is never really settled, but it’s easy to forgive for a generally relaxing drive. The lazy electric motors can mean that accelerating out to overtake middle lane hoggers can take a bit more throttle pedal than you might expect from an electric car. If you like your EVs punchy the e-C4 X might disappoint, but this is in-keeping with its ‘relaxing spa day’ driving experience. Perhaps consider the (bigger, more expensive) Tesla Model Y if you want your EV to pack a bit more punch. With all that talk of prioritising comfort it’s perhaps no surprise to learn that the e-C4 X doesn’t feel particularly at home when driving enthusiastically down a winding country road. The light steering that makes town driving easy is its undoing here, because there’s so little feedback it’s hard to judge your inputs nor have confidence in the front end’s grip. There’s also a bit of lean mid corner, but actually not as much as you’re expecting considering the suspension can be tempted to wallow about at lower speeds from time to time. Regardless, this is a car that’s happier being the tortoise than the hare. Space and practicality Space and practicality Boot space is impressive but the saloon-like opening could make it tricky to load larger items The first thing you’ll probably notice when jumping into the e-C4 X is the comfortable seats, particularly with the Alcantara upholstery found in top-spec models. They’re perhaps closer to squishy armchairs than your average car seat. The driving position takes some getting used to – we would have liked the wheel to adjust higher, for example – but otherwise it feels pretty spacious. Between the passengers is an arm rest with a spacious cubby hole beneath, ahead of which sit a pair of cup holders with a slidable cover, another storage area, and a shelf for your phone. This is flanked by USB charging ports but also acts as the wireless charging pad, the latter of which is a £150 option exclusively for Shine Plus models, unfortunately. Space in the back is generally good. There’s loads of legroom, with a six-foot passenger able to sit behind a six-foot driver without their legs touching the seat in front. Headroom is okay; not massive but enough for most to avoid rubbing their head on the roof. Your thighs should be pretty well supported by the seat, too. Citroen reckons you should be able to fit three in the back but we’d suggest you’d have to be on very good terms as it would be a tight squeeze. One best left to short journeys, probably. The centre seat is a little raised and there’s a lip in the floor, so headroom is less impressive and you’ll be fighting for foot space with those either side. One of the e-C4 X’s key selling points is its capacious boot. At 510 litres it’s not only comfortably bigger than the 380 litres found in the regular e-C4, there’s also more space than any alternatives you might consider. Its closest competitor is the Kia Niro EV, which has 475 litres, while the Renault Megane E-Tech gets 440 litres. The ID3 has 385 litres, while the MG4 props up the table at 363 litres, so if space is key you might have to walk away from the budget-friendly option. With all that being said, the saloon-like entry to the boot is its biggest let down. It’s not the widest aperture, so if you have a large item you might need to get creative to squeeze it in and really maximise the space. There’s also a bit of a lip, so you’ll have to reach in and lift heavier items. On the plus side, there’s handy cable storage so you won’t lose any of that space in order to take charging cables around with you. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories Upmarket feeling for the price, but not exactly exciting to look at Citroen is straddling the line between mainstream and posh with the e-C4. There are plenty of squishy materials that give a hint of premium, which is good when you consider the price. It’s let down in a few areas, such as the digital instrument display behind the wheel. It’s fine at displaying all your basic information, but doesn’t use the full real estate on offer and ends up looking a bit cheap and basic. Especially with the chunky plastic that surrounds it. The same can’t be said for the central infotainment display. All models get a 10.0-inch screen,and wireless smartphone connectivity is standard so even if you don't think much of Citroen's interface you can still bypass it with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Using the menus outside of the obvious radio and navigation systems isn’t always intuitive. Finding your way into deeper menus and settings can be pretty frustrating. That said, the high-resolution screen is easy to read with bright colours and is quick to respond to inputs, even if there’s occasionally a small lag as the graphics play catch up. The steering wheel-mounted buttons are just that: actual buttons. It’s funny how refreshing it is to have some back-to-basics buttons that just work, instead of the unintuitive, touch-sensitive swipe/slide/prod shenanigans that are commonplace now. Electric range, charging and tax Electric range, charging and tax Though there are two electric motor and battery options, unfortunately there’s no option for those who want to go big on range. The e-C4X’s 50kWh battery offers an official 221 miles between charges, which is lower than most alternatives. Opt for the bigger, 54kWh battery and range jumps to 262 miles. For context, the MG4 is closest, with a maximum range of 281 miles from its pricier big battery version, while official figures suggest 340 miles is possible from long-range ID3 models. Even the Volkswagen’s entry-level 58kWh battery will take you 260 miles, though the e-C4X costs less and has similar range to the smaller of the two batteries fitted to the MG4. Citroen has decided to stick with smaller batteries that use less materials, are cheaper to make and result in lighter cars – and how often does the average person travel over 200 miles in one hit? There’s sound logic, but you couldn’t be blamed for looking at options that will go further for around the same cash. In reality, the 54kWh battery is the one to go for. The 50kWh battery comes with a less efficient electric motor, which means real-world range is limited to about 140 miles - less on the motorway or in winter. The bigger battery is more efficient and is capable of over 200 miles on a charge. All models get a Type 2 Mode 3 charging cable included – you can upgrade to an 11kW cable for £300 – and a full charge at a 7kW home wallbox should take about seven and a half hours. With a maximum charge rate of 100kW at public chargers, 0-80% should take about half an hour, though like the range, this maximum charge rate is lower than you’ll see in other models. Safety and security Safety and security Driver assistance systems aren't up to the levels of the more expensive electric cars, but it’s fairly comprehensive, including active safety braking, which can help slow the car to avoid or mitigate the results of a crash, as well as lane keep assist, lane departure detection, forward collision warning and driver attention alert. Step up to the Max model and you get some more advanced kit. The active braking system only uses video detection in the standard setup, but here it’s assisted by radar and includes night-time and cyclist detection. You also get an extended version of the traffic sign recognition system found on base cars. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems Reliability signs for the e-C4 X look promising. Citroen was one of the top 5 most reliable car brands in the 2024 Driver Power owner satisfaction survey, and the pre-facelift C4 range came top of the 2023 survey overall. There are few areas of concern, and the car's electric systems are all well proven in other Stellantis group cars - though some owners do report issues with the infotainment and driving displays."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/citroen/c1,Citroen C1 Review and Prices,"€14,089",6/10,new,"The Citroen C1 is a small city car with funky styling and a colourful cabin. It’s an alternative to other city cars like the Volkswagen Up!, Renault Twingo and Hyundai i10, as well as its sister cars – the Peugeot 108 and Toyota Aygo. As you can see from the pictures, it’s a bright and cheerful little thing, but what these photos don’t show is the sheer range of colours you can choose from. And, that’s before you start to consider the options of a contrasting colour for the roof, or replacing the roof with a retractable canvas roof. Inside, too, you can choose from a variety of colourful options that give the cabin a youthful look and feel. And, if you can’t make up your mind, there are some special editions that make all the important style-related decisions for you. If that sounds good to you, and want to get offers from our trusted Citroen dealers, we’d recommend the 1.0-litre petrol engine with Urban Ride trim. Click the link, choose your colour, hit the Get offers button and see how much you could save: Citroen C1 1.0 Urban Ride . With a large central touchscreen that can be linked to a smartphone fitted to all but the most basic models, the C1 also looks pretty modern, but none of this can hide the fact that the car is built down to a price. The quality of the materials and the construction is not up with what you can find in the Volkswagen Up, for example. On the other hand, there is plenty of space in the front – perhaps more than you might expect, given how small the car is. The driving position is fine, too, but it’s worth noting that the steering wheel adjusts only for height, not reach, and the driver’s seat has no height-adjustment on the most basic version. It’s in the back where the Citroen C1 has to give second best to many of the alternatives. Both the Kia Picanto and Hyundai i10 have much more room in the rear seats, with legroom particularly in short supply. Headroom is also pretty tight, and worse in models with the retractable canvas roof. The boot, too, is smaller than you’ll find in, say, a Volkswagen Up, while the high lip makes it awkward to load and unload luggage. With a cheap car like the C1, it’s easy to focus on how little it can cost, but don’t. You’ll get a much better car if you spend a little bit more on it If you spend most of your life in town, the C1 will suit you down to the ground. It’s a light car, so it feels pretty nippy, even with a 1.0-litre three-cylinder engine; and, because it’s so small and has light steering, a tight turning circle and good visibility, it’s easy to manoeuvre and can dive through traffic. For the same reasons, it’s quite fun to drive on a twisty B-road. However, if you need to take to the highway rather than the High Road, the C1 isn’t as good as the likes of the Up or i10. Although it can cruise at the motorway limit, it makes a lot of noise getting – and staying – there. It’s also far less comfortable at these higher speeds, with the suspension letting passengers feel lots of bumps in the road. There’s only one engine to choose from, but with almost every trim level, you can pair it with either a manual or an automatic gearbox. The manual is the better bet, but both combinations return official fuel economy of more than 50mpg. Overall, the car is cheap to run – if a little more costly to insure than the Up and Skoda Citigo – but the most basic models don’t have much equipment at all. The basic trim is the only one without air-conditioning, DAB radio and the central touchscreen, as well as missing out on practical touches like a height-adjustable driver’s seat and split-folding rear seats. On the other hand, the safety package is pretty good, with Citroen somehow managing to squeeze six airbags into the tiny cabin, while you also get stability control and ABS. Overall, there’s certainly something very appealing about the characterful and colourful C1, but there are lots of arguably better alternatives. To some eyes, the Citroen’s sister cars, the Aygo or 108, may be better-looking, whereas the Up and Citigo are much more grown up and more capable beyond the city limits."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/citroen/c3-picasso,Citroen C3 Picasso Review and Prices,"€19,279",4/10,new,"Step inside and the unusual forms will take your attention from the iffy build quality and the multitude of buttons festooned on the dashboard. Space for passengers is around class average and the boot is big and practical enough for family needs. In terms of engines, you get a duo of fairly small and underpowered units so expect middling performance and fuel economy. The pick of the range is the 100hp diesel, but it’s still fairly slow next to rivals. You won’t need much performance anyway because the C3 Picasso rolls too much in corners to be enjoyable. At least at slow speeds the ride is cosseting and there’s hardly any road noise entering the cabin at speed. Equipment levels are a bit old school so you get air-conditioning and cruise control as standard, but an infotainment system is a £800 option even on the top-spec model. It's a good family car if you simply detest compact SUV crossovers If you need the versatility of a small MPV but want to stand out in the crowd and look stylish then the Citroen C3 Picasso is hard to beat."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/citroen/e-c3,Citroen e-C3 Review & Prices,"€26,846",9/10,new,"Is the Citroen e-C3 a good car? Is the Citroen e-C3 a good car? The new Citroen C3 is a very different beast from its predecessor . Where the old car was a regular small hatchback , the new model has a distinct SUV flavour to it. It’s based on a new platform which is cheaper to build than the old car, and as a result Citroen’s able to offer the all-electric Citroen e-C3 for pretty much the same price as a comparably-sized petrol car from other manufacturers. It's the sort of remarkable value which means the Citroen e-C3 was Highly Commended in the Smart Spender category of the 2025 Carwow Car of the Year Awards . It’s like a holiday to Croatia - on paper, at least, you seem to get a lot for your money. But does that mean it’s even remotely desirable - or is it just cheap and nasty? That’s what we’re here to find out. With prices for this electric e-C3 starting at less than £22,000, alternatives are difficult to come across. It sits a few thousand pounds beneath the cheapest examples of ‘proper’ electric cars, such as the BYD Dolphin , but is still more expensive than pure city cars like the Dacia Spring . The most obvious alternatives are the Hyundai Inster and Renault 5 . It’s a really exciting price point that could make electric motoring accessible to a new swathe of drivers. Range: 199 miles (WLTP) Efficiency: 4.5 mi/kWh Battery size: 44kWh Max charge speed: 100kW Charge time AC: 0-100% in 6 hours (7.4kW) Charge time DC: 20-80% in 26 minutes (100kW) Charge port location: Left rear Power outputs: 113hp It’s a couple of centimetres longer and a tad wider than the Citroen C3 it replaces. But at a full 10cm taller its silhouette is more akin to small SUVs, like the VW T-Cross . That means you get reasonable legroom for four six-foot passengers and bags of headroom inside, plus a 310-litre boot that’s bigger than you’ll find on a Vauxhall Corsa. The interior, meanwhile, is clearly built to a price but hides it well through clever material choices. A big swathe of fabric trim across the dashboard covers up what would otherwise be hard, nasty plastic, and the steering wheel and switchgear - what little there is - actually feels pretty nice to the touch. You get a really simple driver information display above the steering wheel which just shows your speed, range and efficiency information - no extra fancy touches like sat-nav directions or album artwork. For that, you’ll need to turn to the 10.3-inch infotainment system, which feels rather simplified compared to the setups you’ll find in other Citroens but does work well enough. You can always bypass it, with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto , and even a wireless smartphone charging pad on top models. Whichever model you select, you get the same combination of a 113hp electric motor and a 44kWh battery pack. Those are modest numbers, but they combine to give perfectly adequate performance even on a motorway cruise, and an official range of up to 199 miles. The e-C3’s also really set-up for comfort, which is a nice change from all those try-hard faux-sporty SUVs. Though it leans a lot in the corners, the payoff is suspension that soaks up bumps and potholes with ease, plus really comfortable seats that take the edge off poor road surfaces.

You can also find great prices on used Citroen models here, and remember that Carwow can even help you sell your old car when the time comes. How much is the Citroen e-C3? How much is the Citroen e-C3? The Citroen e-C3 feels almost shockingly cheap for an electric car in 2024. Prices for the Plus model start at less than £22,000, which is several thousand pounds cheaper than even the most affordable Vauxhall Corsa Electric or BYD Dolphin. Plus trim does come with all the essentials including a 10.3-inch touchscreen, air-conditioning, remote locking, smartphone mirroring and all the essential safety kit. The higher-up Max trim, which costs £1,700 extra, adds in climate control, tinted rear windows, heated seats and steering wheel and extra connectivity services, which seems a reasonable uplift. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort The Citroen e-C3 has soft suspension perfectly suited to the UK’s terrible roads - just don’t expect it to feel like a sports car in the corners In town It’s a doddle to drive the e-C3 in town. Of course, you get all the usual benefits of an electric car - swift acceleration and no gearchanges making for really smooth, silent progress. Though the electric motor isn’t the most powerful, it’s still plenty for town driving and you won’t ever feel as though you’re lacking power. Compared with cars like the Vauxhall Corsa Electric, which are quite firm, the e-C3 has very soft suspension with clever hydraulic components which Citroen calls ‘Advanced Comfort’. Usually that would be a gimmick, but in this case it suits the pockmarked roads, potholes and speed bumps that litter the UK’s highway network extremely well. You’ll find that bumps you’d really feel in a Corsa Electric are just ironed out in the e-C3. Being sat quite high up, you get good visibility compared with most cars this size, though there’s quite a big blindspot over your shoulder. However, standard rear sensors and a camera on Max models means it’s still a doddle to park the e-C3, helped by a tight turning circle and really light controls. The e-C3 has a reasonable amount of regenerative braking, though it’s not a full one-pedal setup. It’s turned on as default, too - for less regen, you have to press the ‘C’ (for ‘Comfort’) button by the gear selector, whereupon you’ll get a little more coasting. On the motorway The e-C3’s top speed is limited to just 84mph, so it’s perhaps not the best companion for an autobahn holiday in Germany. Up to 70mph though, it’s got enough power - the acceleration does tail off, but no more than it would in a petrol hatchback of this price. Wind and road noise are surprisingly well contained, too, even at top speed. The soft suspension and tall silhouette do mean the e-C3 feels a little more susceptible to crosswinds, and the light steering can feel a little twitchy when you’re going fast. It also has more of a tendency to jitter about on rough surfaces at high speed. But these are all perfectly acceptable traits in a car this cheap - if you want something around this price that’ll be a relaxing companion on the motorway, you’re better off with a petrol hatchback like a Volkswagen Polo . On a twisty road Accurate steering and a surprising amount of grip means the e-C3 doesn’t embarrass itself in the corners - it’s just not much fun. The steering has very little feedback and feels lifeless, though there’s a bit of amusement to be had in seeing just how much it leans in the bends. A lot, is the answer! A Corsa Electric or a BYD Dolphin are more composed in the corners, but neither is much more fun - if you want an electric car that’s engaging to drive, you’ll need something larger like an MG4 . Space and practicality Space and practicality Lots of space for a small car, just don’t expect to find many clever storage solutions The e-C3 makes good use of the space it has. For the driver and passenger up front, there’s loads of adjustment - though the passenger doesn’t get any seat height adjustment so it does feel like you’re sat quite high up. The cabin feels a little narrow too if you’re leaning towards one side of the husky/svelte scale, but it’s no tighter than any car at this price level. Storage up front isn’t bad, either. The door bins are an okay size, and the glovebox is reasonable too. What looks like a shelf on the top of the dash is actually where the passenger airbag comes out, though, so best not to put items up here. Space in the back seats Space for rear passengers is okay, and a little better than more conventional hatchbacks of this size because the e-C3’s extra height means loads of headroom and a more upright seating position. There’s a good view out, too - not always a given, though the windows don’t quite roll all the way down. Legroom and width across the cabin is a little tighter - a six-foot adult can just about sit behind a driver of a similar size, but anyone taller will feel cramped. Meanwhile, you probably won’t want to use the middle seat unless you have three very slim passengers. Boot space The Citroen e-C3 has a 310-litre boot. That sits neatly between the Vauxhall Corsa Electric’s 267 litres and the BYD Dolphin’s 345 - it’s a good size, and doesn’t feel compromised by the electric powertrain. It’s quite a deep space, and there’s a substantial lip to hoick items over. This also means that when you fold down the rear seats (they’re split 60:40 for flexibility) you don’t get a totally flat floor. There aren’t any nice touches, either - the boot carpet feels flung in, and there’s no clever underfloor storage or load separation solutions, with just a single bag hook. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories Feels good inside for a cheap car, though you can find where corners have been cut The Citroen e-C3 has a neat-looking cabin that doesn’t immediately betray its budget roots. Instead of being an unrelenting sea of black plastic, there are some nice material choices - light coloured seats, different plastics used on the door cards, and a swathe of fabric across the middle of the dashboard. This all helps to lift the ambience and make it feel a few steps above bargain basement. You can of course find areas that feel cheap. All the plastics are hardwearing rather than soft-touch, and there are definitely some creaks and flexing when you poke and prod certain bits. It feels reasonably up-to-date in terms of tech, though. The e-C3’s 10.3-inch touchscreen is bright, clear and responsive - it’s a simpler interface than on Citroen’s larger cars, but that’s no stress as all the functionality is still there. It also comes with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, with Max trim bringing a wireless charging pad - some of the e-C3’s alternatives don’t even offer that as an option. You also get a full panel of climate controls, which is a welcome relief when so many car manufacturers are hiding these essential controls away in a touchscreen. Shame you don’t also get a volume knob, though. Instead of a regular gauge cluster you get a high-set strip just under the base of the windscreen - it’s like a halfway house between normal gauges and a head-up display. It’s very easy to read, but it’s a shame you can’t have it display useful extras like navigation instructions. Electric range, charging and tax Electric range, charging and tax The Citroen e-C3 quotes a maximum range of 199 miles. During our test drive, we saw about 3.5 miles per kWh, which would give a range of 150-160 miles, which isn't bad for the size of the battery, but isn't particularly confidence-inspiring for long trips. It’s worth noting that Citroen doesn’t equip any version of the e-C3 with a heat pump. This means that in colder conditions, the range is likely to take quite a big hit, something we plan to test. The max charging rate is only 100kW, but with the e-C3’s relatively small 44kWh battery that’s not much hardship. Citroen claims you can top up from 20-80% in just 26 minutes from a public charger. Charging at home, you’ll see times of around six hours from a regular 7.4kW wallbox. As an option, you can upgrade the e-C3 with 11kW charging, which brings times down to about four hours. As for tax, as an electric car the e-C3 doesn’t pay any road tax until 2025 and it’s in the lowest band of benefit-in-kind company car tax. Safety and security Safety and security The e-C3 hasn’t yet been tested by Euro NCAP . The Indian-market model has undergone crash testing, and scored poorly, but the European model has been strengthened and comes with significantly more safety equipment. The platform has been built to a cost, though, so we wouldn’t necessarily expect the full five-star rating. All C3s get cruise control , lane-keeping aids, autonomous emergency braking, speed limit alerts - the usual roster of safety equipment, in other words. Our test car had all of these disabled so we can’t tell you how annoying or otherwise they are in practice, though it’s nice to see quick shortcut buttons to the side of the steering wheel for turning them off. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems Citroen’s reputation for reliability isn’t historically the greatest, but it’s doing very well these days - the C4 and e-C4 scored an outright victory in the 2023 Driver Power owner satisfaction survey . The e-C3 uses a platform designed for developing markets, which suggests a degree of ruggedness, and its electric drivetrain has very few moving parts to go wrong. A three-year, unlimited mileage warranty gives some peace of mind, though it’d be nice if Citroen went the way of other budget manufacturers like Kia or MG in offering longer coverage."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/citroen/e-c3-aircross,Citroen e-C3 Aircross Review & Prices,"€28,191",8/10,new,"Is the Citroen e-C3 Aircross a good car? Is the Citroen e-C3 Aircross a good car? The Citroen e-C3 Aircross is, in a nutshell, a slightly larger version of the regular Citroen e-C3 . While the petrol-powered C3 Aircross can be had with seven seats, that’s not an option for this EV variant, so you can consider it a bit like an estate car version of a regular hatchback - though it can’t carry any more people, it has more space in the back seats and a bigger boot. Like the regular C3, it’s also remarkable value, coming in at less than £23,000 - making it cheaper than any other electric car of this size. It’s like shopping at the cash ‘n’ carry, where you can get big packs of all your household favourites for not very much money - the flip side is, they’re often slightly less desirable than the name brands and might taste a bit funny if you don’t readjust your expectations. The first thing to adjust is your expectations of the e-C3 Aircross’ electric range. While other electric SUVs are increasingly bringing 200 or even 300+ miles of range to the table, for the e-C3 Aircross that figure is just 188 miles according to official tests - about 11 miles less than the smaller, lighter e-C3. Range: 188 miles (WLTP) Efficiency: 4.3 mi/kWh Battery size: 44kWh Max charge speed: 100kW Charge time AC: 0-100% in 6 hours (7.4kW) Charge time DC: 20-80% in 26 minutes (100kW) Charge port location: Left rear Power outputs: 113hp However, even though that number is pretty unimpressive, there’s a lot about the e-C3 Aircross that makes up for it. First, the practicality. The C3 Aircross is still a small car, despite its chunky-looking SUV proportions and raised ride height - but it’s only 10cm longer than a Volkswagen Golf hatchback . Despite this, you get nice spacious rear seats with plenty of room for adults, and a 460-litre boot - for reference, a regular family SUV like the Nissan Qashqai has 504 litres of space. There’s a lot to like about the interior of the e-C3 Aircross, too. Though it’s undeniably built to a price, Citroen’s been very clever in how it uses materials - a nice-feeling steering wheel and some neat fabric trim across the width of the dash mean it feels more expensive than it is. You get a fairly basic touchscreen infotainment system, but wireless smartphone connectivity comes as standard, so you can bypass it. To drive, the e-C3 Aircross feels a lot like the regular e-C3 - it’s just a little bit bigger and heavier. Citroen has fitted its clever ‘Advanced Comfort’ suspension which does a good job of ironing out bumps in the road, but the extra weight over the standard car does mean it’s not quite as comfortable. If you want a roomy, cheap, electric SUV, your options are few and far between. Alternatives include the closely-related Vauxhall Frontera Electric , which feels more conventional than the e-C3 Aircross - that might be to your taste, though. There’s also the Hyundai Inster , which offers better range and a flexible interior for a bit more money, or the BYD Dolphin , which has a similar amount of rear seat space but in a standard hatchback body.

You can see our other Citroen deals , or get a great price on a used Citroen for sale here. And remember that Carwow’s the place to be if you’re selling your old car , with our customers getting a better price on average than they were offered in part-exchange. How much is the Citroen e-C3 Aircross? How much is the Citroen e-C3 Aircross? With prices kicking off at just under £23,000, the Citroen e-C3 Aircross is one of the most affordable electric cars on sale today. It’s around £1,000 more than the regular e-C3 hatch , so it’s really up to you whether you want the extra space of the Aircross, or the smaller dimensions and slightly better driving range of the regular e-C3. Trim levels are nice and simple - they’re called Plus and Max. Plus models come with wireless smartphone connectivity, climate control, LED lights and a full suite of safety kit, so they’re hardly Spartan inside, but you’ll want to step up to Max trim if you want items like blind-spot monitoring, heated seats and built-in sat-nav. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort Comfortable over bumps - but the tradeoff is that it's not much fun in the bends The e-C3 Aircross feels very similar to the regular e-C3 when you’re driving it, so for more detail make sure you read our review of that car. In brief, though, the e-C3 Aircross’ fancy ‘Advanced Comfort’ suspension makes short work of most lumps and bumps around town. It has a hydraulic element a bit like famous Citroens of old and while it doesn’t have the ‘magic carpet’ ride that its predecessors were famed for it certainly makes a regular small SUV like a Renault Captur feel very stiff over potholes and speed bumps. The electric motor’s modest output of just 113hp doesn’t feel like a problem when you’re just pootling around at town speeds, and you get good visibility thanks to the raised ride height. It’s a shame that the regenerative braking can’t be amped right up like it can in most electric cars, so you don’t really get a pronounced ‘one-pedal driving’ mode. The e-C3’s wimpy motor does mean it’s a bit more of a struggle to get up to speed than it is in most alternative electric SUVs, and that’s especially likely to be the case if you’re making the most of that roomy boot and back seat. With a top speed limited to just 89mph you won’t be making tracks on the German autobahn either, but that won’t bother you on the UK motorway network. In truth, it doesn’t feel any less suited to the motorway than a small, entry-level hatchback does - except when it comes to stability. The e-C3 Aircross has quite high sides, making it susceptible to crosswinds and buffeting from larger vehicles, and it jitters about on rough surfaces. It’s not dangerous, but it can feel a little unsettling compared to lower, sturdier small cars. The e-C3 Aircross has light steering and a reasonable amount of grip in the corners, but it’s a long way from ‘fun’ - the steering may as well be a video game controller, as it feels lifeless and like it’s barely connected to the front wheels. As with the e-C3, that’s unlikely to matter to most people, as you’ll probably prioritise the e-C3 Aircross being a doddle to drive in town over it being the last word in sporty handling on a twisting B-road. But if you do want an electric car that’s satisfying to drive, consider the rear-wheel drive MG 4 EV. Space and practicality Space and practicality A bigger boot than the Citroen e-C3 and roomy back seat - shame there's no seven-seat option In the front seats, the e-C3 Aircross is indistinguishable from the regular Citroen C3. That means you get smart ‘Advanced Comfort’ seats, which look flat but actually offer a lot of support. They adjust reasonably well for drivers of all sizes and feature height adjustment, which still isn’t always a given on a cheap car - and the steering wheel adjusts for height and for reach too. Storage for small items is okay with decent-sized door bins that will fit a large bottle of water. What looks like a shelf on top of the dash is actually where the passenger airbag comes out, so don’t put items up there - but you do get two big cupholders in the centre plus a spot to put your phone. On top-spec Max models, this has a wireless charging pad. There’s more room in the back of the e-C3 Aircross than there is in the regular C3, and it has a slightly more laid-back seating position as a result. Though you won’t mistake it for a limousine any time soon, two six-foot adults can get comfortable with plenty of leg and headroom. It’s not any wider than the standard car, however, so it remains very cramped for three adults to sit abreast on the rear bench. ISOFIX points are present on both outer rear seats, and are nice and easy to get to, while the upright seating position and big square windows give a good view out. It’s worth noting that, while the petrol and hybrid C3 Aircross comes with the option of seven seats, this all-electric e-C3 does not. With 460 litres of room the e-C3 Aircross has more space than any electric car of this price - apart from the closely-related Vauxhall Frontera, which matches it. Compared to the Dacia Spring (308 litres) Leapmotor T03 (210 litres) Renault 5 (326 litres) or Hyundai Inster (280 litres), it’s positively cavernous. Even more expensive cars don’t come close, and you’ll need to look at something like a Hyundai Kona Electric before you find more storage space. Fold the seats down and you get 1,600 litres to play with, and an adjustable boot floor allows you to balance overall cargo area with having a totally flat floor. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories Once again here you’ll find that the e-C3 Aircross is identical to the other cars in the C3 range . The cabin is cheap, but it feels like it’s been screwed together properly, which isn’t always a given in cheap cars where corner-cutting can feel very obvious. The cheaper materials are cleverly used in places where they won’t matter, while the things you touch - the steering wheel, the column stalks, and the portion of the dash closest to you - all feel nice enough. The fabric covering for the dashboard is a particularly nice touch and lifts the interior in a way cheap black plastic can’t. Instead of a glitzy digital screen the e-C3 Aircross displays its driver information in a thin strip just below the windscreen. Here you’ll find easy-to-read LCD instruments, though nothing like a full-screen map as you might get on more expensive cars. It’s hard to fault the central 10.3-inch touchscreen, though. It has a simple operating system that works well, and it’s sharp and clear. And though the functionality is a little basic, it has everything you need - built-in sat-nav comes on the top-spec Max model, but all versions get wireless smartphone connectivity through Apple CarPlay and Android Auto so you can bypass Citroen’s infotainment system easily. Electric range, charging and tax Electric range, charging and tax With just 188 miles of range in official testing the e-C3 Aircross is unlikely to become your family’s new favourite road trip companion. In warm conditions, covering mixed mileage but without much motorway, we saw an indicated range of about 140 miles. It’s perfectly suitable for people who do short, regular journeys and are able to charge up regularly at home but not much more - if you want a cheap electric car that goes a long way, you’ll need something like an MG4 Extended Range. You can also expect the range to dip more in winter, because no version of the e-C3 gets a heat pump for more efficient heating in cold weather. Every version of the BYD Dolphin does. The e-C3 Aircross can top up at a maximum rate of 100kW, which isn’t very fast but is perfectly adequate given the car’s small battery. Citroen claims you can top up from 20-80% in just 26 minutes from a public charger. A full charge at home will take around six hours, though you can upgrade to faster 11kW charging if your home supports it, which will bring that time to around four hours. The e-C3 Aircross, as a fully electric car, pays the lowest rate of first-year road tax, and slots into the lowest tax band for company car use. Safety and security Safety and security The e-C3 Aircross hasn’t yet been crash tested by Euro NCAP, and neither has the C3 or e-C3 on which it’s based. The Indian-market C3 underwent crash testing in its local market and performed poorly, but Citroen has strengthened the European model and added better safety equipment. However, it’s still based on a set of components designed to be as cheap as possible in developing countries, so when it is tested you shouldn’t necessarily expect a full five-star rating. You do get all the mandatory safety equipment fitted as standard, which works well enough and is easy to disable when needed. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems Citroen’s days of poor reliability would seem to be behind it with its excellent performance in the latest Driver Power owner satisfaction surveys. The e-C3 Aircross is based on components designed for developing markets, and so should prove pretty sturdy, and as an electric car it has even fewer moving parts than normal to go wrong. Citroen offers a three-year, unlimited mileage warranty, plus up to eight years of warranty on powertrain components - that’s the battery and electric motor and their associated parts."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/citroen/c4-x,Citroen C4 X Review & Prices,"€28,396",6/10,new,"Is the Citroen C4 X a good car? Is the Citroen C4 X a good car? The Citroen C4 X is what happens when there’s a fire in a car dealership and a hatchback, an SUV and a saloon car all get melted together. Based on the regular C4 , which is already a sort of halfway house between hatch and SUV, the C4 X adds more fuel to the fire with a fully separate saloon boot. This might sound antiquated, and it certainly harks back to days past when the default family car was something like a Ford Cortina. It’s like a re-release of a classic record player, but with Bluetooth and MP3 functionality slightly uncomfortably grafted on. The C4 X (and the C4 hatch) both received a mid-life facelift in early 2025, upgrading their tech levels and ushering in a new look. Conceptually, there’s nothing much like the C4 X - the only other small saloon cars on sale are from premium brands such as the BMW 3 Series - but if you want something that has jacked-up suspension and a sleek silhouette, you might look to the Renault Arkana , Volkswagen Taigo or Peugeot 3008 . In all aspects other than its boot, the Citroen C4 X is the same as the regular Citroen C4. So let’s start with the point of difference - the load area. You get a huge 510 litres of load capacity, which is much bigger than the paltry 380 litres of the C4 hatchback. But what you gain in capacity you lose in flexibility. The C4 X’s boot lid doesn’t open wide enough to allow you to load big, bulky items, and while you can fold the rear seats down for longer loads you still have a fixed parcel shelf which limits you from carrying anything taller than about two feet. So while it’s great for soft bags or loads of supermarket shopping, if you want to take your old appliances to the tip, you’re out of luck. In the cabin, the C4 X has the same dashboard as the C4 hatchback, with a 10.0-inch infotainment screen and 7.0-inch driver display. They work well enough, though the infotainment system can be slightly labyrinthine in terms of where functions are hidden in the menu structure. In the back seats, you get slightly more headroom than the C4 hatchback, though legroom and width are identical. The rear backrest is also ever-so-slightly more reclined - by a whole degree - but you won’t mistake it for the back seat of a Mercedes S-Class anytime soon. In terms of engines, the C4 X is really easy - there’s only one available. It’s a 1.2-litre petrol with a hybrid system, and it replaces both the old 1.2-litre non-hybrid petrol and the 1.5-litre diesel that was previously available. It provides reasonable performance and good fuel economy, though it’s not as efficient as the Renault Symbioz’s hybrid engine - or as nice to drive. There’s also a fully-electric Citroen e-C4 X available, but we’ve covered that in a separate review. What all versions of the C4 X do get is partially hydraulic suspension, which makes it very comfortable over bumps.

And remember that you can even sell your old car through Carwow, where our network of trusted dealers will bid to get you the best price. How much is the Citroen C4 X? How much is the Citroen C4 X? The C4 X is pretty inexpensive for its size. No longer available as an entry-level model, it comes in a choice of two high-specced trim levels - Plus and Max - but both are significantly cheaper than even the most basic Volkswagen Golf. For just over £24,000 you get a 10.0-inch screen with built-in nav, LED headlights, climate control, a 360-degree camera, 18-inch alloy wheels and wireless phone connectivity with a wireless charger. Stepping up to Max brings you heated front seats and steering wheel as well as a raft of extra driver assistance kit. The C4 X may not be as cheap as a Dacia Duster , but the top-spec Max model is still comparable to well-equipped examples of much smaller superminis such as the Volkswagen Polo . Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort Comfortable in town or on the motorway, but keen drivers or speed demons look elsewhere The C4 X is pretty good to drive in town. Thanks to the hydraulic suspension it irons out bad surfaces and speed bumps really well, with no thudding over potholes or juddering on uneven tarmac like you'd find on some sportier-feeling alternatives. Compared to a more firm-riding SUV like the Toyota C-HR the C4 X feels like a limousine. The car's steering is very light, and visibility from the front is good. A reversing camera to make parking easier is standard on the middle of the three trim levels - we'd say this is a particularly useful addition, as the C4 X's bodacious rear is harder to judge than a hatchback would be when parking. The hybrid engine isn't bad around town - it doesn't drive on electric power for very long, though, and it's quite noisy when it cuts back in, certainly moreso than the equivalent Toyota. However, it shifts gears smoothly enough and has plenty of low-down grunt. The suspension here is more of an acquired taste. Some will find the C4 X's soft setup to be really comfortable on a long trip - and there's no denying that it does iron out road imperfections really well. Things like motorway expansion joints don't really intrude on the cabin, like they would in a Volkswagen Taigo. However, you might find the C4 X to feel almost uncomfortably floaty - a sensation that can induce car-sickness in some. If the suspension setup suits you then there's little else to complain about on the motorway. The C4 X isn't a particularly powerful car, but can keep up with traffic with no real issues - though you may need to drop a gear or two on a sliproad or when overtaking, especially if the car's fully laden. The C4 X will handle hard cornering but it's not particularly enjoyable to do. The body leans quite a lot in bends - again, thanks to the soft suspension setup that makes it so comfortable on bad roads - and this can make it feel a little uncontrolled if you're going fast. The steering doesn't inspire much confidence either. It's so light that you could drive it with one finger, but there's not much of a sense of connection between the steering wheel and the road - so you can't feel how much grip you have in the bends. A Ford Puma is much more fun to drive. Space and practicality Space and practicality Roomy back seats and a big boot, but no good for carrying bigger items The Citroen C4 X is nicely roomy up front. The wide, flat seats don’t have particularly pronounced bolstering so it’s very easy to slide yourself in, and all models come with height adjustment for the driver’s seat plus reach and rake adjustment on the steering wheel so it’s easy to make yourself comfortable. Storage solutions are actually very clever, too. There are two reasonable cupholders just in front of the gear selector, and underneath the climate controls you get a deep tray for odds and ends as well as a grippy shelf to keep your smartphone on. It’s flanked by USB-C and regular USB ports. The door bins are large, and while the glovebox is a bit pokey you do get a really handy slide-out drawer above it, ideal for keeping snacks. There’s even a mounting point where you can clip a tablet holder, so front-seat passengers can entertain themselves. Despite the C4 X’s sloping roof there’s pretty good headroom in the rear seats for all but the extremely tall. Legroom is less impressive, but there's space for a six-foot passenger to sit behind a driver of a similar size. It's easily as roomy as the Renault Arkana . The C4 X is a little narrow to make seating three across the back particularly comfortable, but if you do need to then the centre passenger has room for their feet plus a seat that isn’t set too high. The big rear windows give a good view out, too, and there are ISOFIX points for mounting child seats in both rear seats. With 510 litres on offer, the C4 X’s boot looks extremely capacious on paper compared to the regular C4 (380 litres) as well as the smaller cars with which it competes on price. To get more overall capacity, you’d need something like the significantly more expensive Skoda Octavia (600 litres) or the Volkswagen Golf estate (611 litres). However, a saloon opening means the C4 X’s boot is rather limited. Where on a regular hatchback you could remove the parcel shelf and load items right up to the rear window, that’s not an option here - everything that goes into the boot must fit through the rather narrow tailgate. And while you can fold the back seats down to liberate more space for longer items - they split 60:40 and there’s a ski hatch in the middle seat - they do leave a big hump in the load floor that’s extremely awkward to hoick items over. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories Easy to use, well-built, but hard to get excited about Given some of the wacky cars in Citroen’s back catalogue you might be expecting the C4 X to have a quirky interior. Well, you’ll be disappointed - it’s boringly conventional. That’s actually a boon if you don’t like the proliferation of all-touchscreen interiors. The C4 X has plenty of physical switchgear, including a panel for the climate controls, shortcut switches for the safety equipment and a ‘home’ button for the infotainment system - all really useful. The infotainment system is a big, 10.0-inch widescreen sat high up on the dash within easy reach. It runs software that’s based around customisable tiles, and in many places feels like a smartphone to operate. Speaking of smartphones, wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are both standard on all models - though only the top-spec Max car has a wireless charging pad to really make the most of this. All models also get a 7.0-inch digital instrument display. This is nowhere near as customisable as something like the Virtual Cockpit you get on a Volkswagen, and it can’t do things like display a full-screen map. It’s clear enough, though, with essential information displayed big and bold in the centre. MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax The C4 X is relatively lightweight, simple, and not particularly powerful, so it's no surprise that its hybrid engine can provide pretty good fuel economy. You should find 50mpg achievable in mixed driving, and more like 55mpg if you do a long, gentle cruise. That's a pretty good figure, though the Toyota C-HR will do more than 60mpg if you're careful, and is much more powerful. CO2 emissions are also good but not stellar. At 106g/km they're lower than the equivalent petrol or diesel, but there is no plug-in hybrid model to reduce costs further, so the C4 X doesn't make as appealing a company car choice as it could. There is an all-electric e-C4 X available if you want to reduce running costs to a minimum. Safety and security Safety and security The C4 X retains the Euro NCAP rating of the Citroen C4 it’s based on, which means a four-star rating. It provides good collision protection but lost points thanks to a relative dearth of active safety features. You do get traffic sign and speed limit recognition, lane departure warning and cruise control as standard, plus a 360-degree camera and a head-up display . Reliability and problems Reliability and problems Citroen’s historic reliability record isn’t great but in recent years it’s turned around somewhat. The engines in particular are extremely well-proven and used across a vast number of Citroen , Peugeot , Vauxhall and now even Fiat and Jeep models. That's compounded by Citroen's fifth-place finish in the 2024 Driver Power survey and the C4 hatch coming top of the 2023 survey. Citroen offers a three-year, 60,000 mile warranty with the C4 X, which is the same as most European competitors such as the Peugeot 2008 or VW Golf. Citroen has an ace up its sleeve, though, as it now covers powertrain-specific components - the engine and gearbox, namely - for eight years. A Kia xCeed has a seven-year warranty on the entire car, though, while a Toyota C-HR has up to ten. Citroen C4 X FAQs Citroen C4 X FAQs"
https://www.carwow.co.uk/citroen/e-c4,Citroen e-C4 Review & Prices,"€37,803",7/10,new,"Is the Citroen e-C4 a good car? Is the Citroen e-C4 a good car? The Citroen e-C4 is the all-electric version of the Citroen C4 . Like that car, it’s an odd mashup of hatchback , coupe and SUV - with compact dimensions, a dramatically sloping roofline, but a raised ride height and chunky bodywork. Where the standard C4 comes with either petrol or hybrid engines, the e-C4 electric car gets a choice of two electric motor and battery setups - but both of them have the same focus on comfort above sportiness, with clever hydraulic elements in the suspension and pillowy seats inside. It’s a bit like one of those sofas with the built-in electric recliners - steadfastly comfort-oriented but with a modern twist. The e-C4 got an extensive facelift in late 2024, bringing with it new front-end styling incorporating the latest iteration of Citroen’s logo. A large roundel dominates the front end while slim grilles flanked by triple-layer LED headlights also feature. At the rear, the main change is that the boot lid now has ‘CITROEN’ spelled out across its width. Range: 218 - 256 miles Efficiency: 4.4 - 4.7 mi/kWh Battery size: 50/54kWh Max charge speed: 100kW Charge time AC: 7hr 15m 0 - 100% Charge time DC: 30 minutes 10 - 80% Charge port location: Left side rear Power outputs: 136 - 156hp Otherwise, the e-C4’s styling is still an odd blend of classes. When it comes to size, it’s not dissimilar to an electric family hatchback such as a Volkswagen ID3 . However, it gets a raised ride height and high-set driving position, so you might shortlist it alongside compact SUVs such as the Kia EV3 , Hyundai Kona Electric or Volvo EX30 . In terms of price, however, the e-C4 is a match for some of the cheapest electric cars on sale - with the entry-level model being akin to a basic Vauxhall Corsa Electric , BYD Dolphin or MG4 EV . Compared to those cars, the e-C4 is quite practical. The rear seats are roomy enough and the 380-litre boot matches a Volkswagen Golf in capacity - notably, it’s no smaller than you get on a petrol C4, which isn’t always the case when an electric car is based on the same underpinnings as one with a petrol engine. You also get a really rather pleasant interior considering the price tag. Material quality is cheap in places, but everything you touch feels a notch or two higher-quality than you might expect. The fact that much of the switchgear is shared with posher cars, such as the Peugeot E-2008 , can’t hurt. There are two choices of electric motor with the e-C4. The lower two trim levels come with the same combination you got at launch - a 50kWh battery and 136hp electric motor. The top trim level gets slightly more capacity and power, but greater efficiency means the real-world range is hugely improved. Officially, the 50kWh car will do up to 218 miles on a charge, while the 54kWh version will do 256 miles. Whichever version you go for, don’t expect it to accelerate like a Tesla Model 3 . Performance is modest, but it’s nippy enough around town and like all electric cars is super-smooth and predictable. And unlike many EVs, which ride bumps like they have suspension made of wood, Citroen’s clever hydraulic setup effortlessly irons out imperfections around town and makes long journeys very comfortable indeed - at the expense of being less enjoyable to drive down a twisty road.

You can find a used Citroen C4 for sale , or check out our other used Citroens for sale . And remember that Carwow’s the place to be if you’re trying to sell your old car . How much is the Citroen e-C4? How much is the Citroen e-C4? Three trim levels are available, named You!, Plus and Max. You! models come with the more basic 50kWh battery and 136hp electric motor, and at just over £26,000 are extremely competitively priced against smaller EVs like the BYD Dolphin or Vauxhall Corsa Electric. They’re not exactly meanly equipped either, with LED headlights, climate control, and a 10.0-inch infotainment touchscreen. Plus models get the same electric motor and battery but add a larger instrument display plus a head-up display, as well as sat-nav and a reversing camera. Meanwhile Max models come in at more than £30,000 but get the bigger battery and more powerful electric motor, plus keyless entry, heated seats, and extra driver assistance kit. What’s quite nice is that Citroen fits the same alloy wheels on all three models, so you’re not visually marked out for buying the cheap seats. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort So comfortable, especially in town, but not a lot of fun to drive The e-C4 is as easy to drive as any electric car around town. You get two pedals, like any petrol car with an automatic gearbox, but there are no gearchanges so you just get seamless acceleration and instant response from a standstill. This makes it really easy to nip quickly out of junctions and makes stop-start traffic effortless. There is a ‘B’ mode for the Citroen’s gearbox, which amps up the regenerative braking when you lift off the throttle, but there’s no one-pedal driving mode like you get in a Hyundai Kona Electric so you will still need to use the brakes. Citroen has fitted the e-C4 with its ‘Progressive Hydraulic Cushion’ suspension. They’re not for your sofa, but they add a fluid-filled element to the end of the suspension’s travel so that when you hit a big bump, the impact is dealt with gently. It’s not as squashy as the air suspension you get on a proper luxury car, but it makes mincemeat of most lumps and bumps around town, gliding over speed bumps. The e-C4’s steering is extremely light, which is good for parking. Visibility out of the front is good but the rear window’s quite narrow and the view over your shoulder is poor thanks to the sloping roofline. You do get a ‘top-down’ camera view on mid-spec models and above, but the resolution is pretty rubbish. The e-C4’s suspension is great on the motorway, too. Expansion joints, rumble strips and potholes simply don’t bother you like they would in an MG4 or Volkswagen ID3. It’s a very relaxing experience, though it can be a little bit floaty - some people might get car sick. The suspension, combined with low wind and road noise, make the e-C4 a great electric car for covering long distances in. However, do bear in mind that the 50kWh battery pack only gives you around 140 miles of range at motorway speeds, so probably not the best for a family holiday. This is upped to about 200 miles in the bigger battery car. Neither version is particularly rapid, but they don’t feel out of their depth at motorway speeds either - you can keep up with traffic just fine and overtake without too much concern. Here’s where the e-C4 kind of falls apart. It’s not that it’s dreadfully floppy to drive or anything, but the steering is too light and too distant from what’s happening for the driver to have any real enjoyment. Again, the soft suspension is as good at soaking up rural roads as it is dealing with mean city streets, but you’re just not going to take the e-C4 out for a drive just for the fun of it. The extra weight doesn’t help either — the e-C4 is around 500kg heavier than a petrol C4, and it shows through the bends with duller responses and a lack of dynamism when trying to corner quickly. It’s also worth noting that the e-C4 doesn’t give all of its power until you put it into Sport mode. If you’re in Normal mode, you get a reduced power output, and it’s quite annoying as this is what the car defaults to on startup - so unless you remember to switch into Sport mode every time, you’re never getting the e-C4’s full output of 136hp or 156hp. Space and practicality Space and practicality Comfortable seats and good storage, but rear seats are a little cramped There’s plenty of storage space in the front of the e-C4, not least because the compact little gear selector switch frees up plenty of room for a lidded storage box down on the centre console. You’ll also find the cupholders in there. In front of the gear selector, there’s a double-floored storage space, which means you can stash some items under a little lid, and then pile more stuff on top of that lid. Above that, there’s another tray which is home to the wireless phone charger, although that’s only standard on the top-spec Max model. As well as the (slightly small) glovebox, there’s a slide-out tray in front of the passenger seat, which is just the right size for an iPad or similar tablet. Above that, there’s a little pop-out bracket which will hold a tablet, making your front-seat passenger feel like they’re sitting in a much more expensive car with screens for everyone. Sort of. The front seats are exceptionally comfortable, and feel more like squashy armchairs than car seats. The sloping roofline means that headroom is a little bit tighter than it could be in the back of the e-C4. It’s not a huge problem for those sitting in the outer rear seats, but anyone perched in the slightly higher-up central rear seat is going to notice it. It’s not outrageously tight, but it’s certainly a little bit less roomy back there than in the VW ID3 or BYD Dolphin. The floor of the e-C4 isn’t flat, either — there’s a ‘transmission’ hump left over from sharing a structure with the petrol and diesel C4, so anyone trying to sit in the middle rear seat is going to have to share foot space with others in the back. There are some nice touches, though — all versions come with seatback pockets, and there are USB sockets and air vents for those in the back. You’ll only get a rear armrest on the top-spec model, though. At 380 litres, the e-C4’s boot is actually really good for a budget-priced electric car. It’s just 5 litres less than you get in a Volkswagen ID3, but notably larger than the 363 litres you get in an MG4, the 345 litres in a BYD Dolphin or the paltry 267 litres in a Vauxhall Corsa Electric. The sloping roofline does mean that large, boxy items won’t fit, though - if you’re planning to use the e-C4 for an impromptu tip run then be careful with the closing the boot or you might find the corner of your fridge-freezer smashes the glass. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories Well-built but feels a little old-fashioned in places Compare the Citroen e-C4’s interior to the all-screen Volkswagen ID3 or even the unconventional BYD Dolphin and you might wonder where Citroen’s reputation for the avant-garde has gone - it’s boringly sensible. That’s actually great news for everyday usability, though, as unlike many alternatives it comes with plenty of physical buttons rather than forcing everything through a touchscreen. Of particular note is a big panel of climate controls - much easier to use than messing about trying to change the temperature with an onscreen slider or touch-sensitive button. You also get straightforward steering wheel controls. There are screens, of course. Every model gets a 10.0-inch infotainment touchscreen, which is high-res and much easier to use than on the pre-facelift car. Some of the menus are still a bit of amaze, but you should be able to find the functions you’re after without too much trouble - and you can easily create shortcuts from the homescreen to your more frequently used features. There’s also a straightforward shortcut button to shut off some of the Citroen’s more annoying mandatory safety features, which is always welcome. All models get wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto allowing you to bypass Citroen’s interface with ease, though it’s worth noting that only top-spec Max cars get a wireless charger to complement this. The base-spec You! model gets a cramped and ugly 5.5-inch driver’s display, while Plus and Max models get a higher-res 7.0-inch unit - but neither are particularly sophisticated or configurable. You can’t show a full-screen map, for instance. What’s nice is that, while Citroen has used some cheap materials, overall the feeling of quality is much higher than you get from a similarly-priced EV like an MG4. Everything you touch feels good and it’s screwed together very solidly, with no squeaks or rattles. Electric range, charging and tax Electric range, charging and tax Good range, until you take it on the motorway There are two motor and battery options for the e-C4. You! and Plus models come with the same setup the pre-facelift car had from launch, pairing a 50kWh battery to a 136hp electric motor. Max models get a newer and more efficient setup, with a 54kWh battery and a 156hp electric motor. The 50kWh setup offers up to a claimed 218 miles on a charge. The truth is, that number is only achievable if you’re mostly driving around town - in motorway driving, expect around 140 miles, and even less in winter weather. Unless your needs are very modest, it’s definitely best to upgrade to the bigger battery, despite the extra cost. The 54kWh battery doesn’t sound much bigger on paper, but it has a claimed range of 256 miles and thanks to a much more efficient electric motor it will come a lot closer to that figure. On purely motorway driving you can expect around 200 miles, and in mixed mileage more like 220 miles. The charging rate of 100kW isn’t spectacular but it’s good enough, and as the battery isn’t massive it means you can add a healthy 10-80% charge in less than 30 minutes. Alternatives such as the MG4 can go further for less money, but the basic Volkswagen ID3 or BYD Dolphin are pretty comparable, offering official ranges of 241 and 265 miles respectively. As with all electric cars, the e-C4 is exempt from road tax and attracts very favourable Benefit-in-Kind company car tax rates. Safety & security Safety & security When tested by Euro NCAP the C4 range scored four out of five stars, tested back in 2021. Alternatives do have five-star ratings, and more recent ones too. However, scores for crash protection of adults and children were strong. The C4 isn’t short of safety equipment though, with all models offering the basics - autonomous emergency braking, lane-keeping aids and driver attention alerts are all standard. The Max model gets additional driver assistance kit including the ability to semi-autonomously drive itself on motorways. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems Citroen offers a three-year, 60,000 mile warranty on the whole car as well as an eight-year, 100,000 mile warranty on all the powertrain components including the battery. Citroens of old didn’t typically have the best reliability record but that’s a reputation that’s been quashed in recent years. Citroen was named the fifth best brand to own in the 2024 Driver Power owner satisfaction survey, and the C4 range came top overall of the 2023 survey - a fantastic result.

https://www.carwow.co.uk/citroen/ami,Citroen Ami Review & Prices,"€9,541",5/10,new,"Is the Citroen Ami a good car? Is the Citroen Ami a good car? The Citroen Ami is like a toy car broke out of the local shop, picked up the electric motor from a washing machine on the way out, and set off into the big world to try and be a ‘real car.’ It’s not quite a real car, though, as the in-car tech isn’t much better than you’d get from Matchbox or Hot Wheels… It’s hard to be hard on the Ami, simply because it’s so cute and comes across as being so plucky. Really, it’s not a car at all, but is technically a quadricycle and is aimed mostly at the French car market, where a quirk of the rules means that people as young as 14 can drive one of these. The UK market kind of got caught up in the massive publicity surrounding the Ami, which is why it’s here, and why Fiat will also bring in the similar Topolino (although Vauxhall has no plans to rebadge Opel’s version, the Rocks-e). The whole point of the Ami is that it’s cheap and durable, so the doors are the same on both sides (you can swap them around, which is why the hinges are on the front on one side, and at the back on the other) while the headlights and brake lights are simple round items which pop into the same fixings. Citroen decided that it wouldn’t be worth the cost of setting the Ami up for right-hand drive, as that would make it pointlessly expensive, so it’s left-hand drive only, with the driver’s side accessed through the rear-hinged door. That’s OK, because the Ami will only ever be driven in town, and also because you’re surrounded by glass on all sides, making all-round visibility a doddle (which is also why there’s no rear-view mirror — just swivel your head). The cabin is spectacularly basic, mostly because the Ami was designed to be used by on-street car rental services, so it’s basically hose-out. The seats look like school chairs, but they’re actually pretty comfy, and there’ lots of space for bags and suchlike. There’s a simple digital speedo and range indicator, but if you want entertainment you’ll have to supply your own speaker or headphones. There’s space for a suitcase on the floor of the passenger side, but not much else, although there are some storage spaces and a shelf below the windscreen. It’s not really a practical car, the Ami, but it’s OK for small shopping trips or urban school runs. Specifically urban school runs, though. Technically, you could drive an Ami on the motorway, but with a 28mph top speed it’s going to be pretty scary. There’s a tiny 8hp electric motor, which gives the Ami acceleration of 7.4 seconds… to get to 25mph. Still, it’s fine around town as long as you don’t accidentally wander into a 50mph zone… The 5.4kWh battery is tiny, so the range is just 46 miles at best, but the tiny size pays off because the battery can be charged back up in just four hours from a three-pin domestic socket, and the Ami even has its own built-in charging cable. There’s almost no suspension to speak of, so you’ll feel every bump and lump thumping up through that plastic body, but the Ami genuinely is quite good fun to drive, and it’s still rare enough that everyone who sees one smiles at it. The best bit is how easy it is to thread through town, and you’ll be searching out London Cabs to show off that you can turn even more tightly than they can, thanks to the Ami’s tiny 7.2 metre turning circle (a Cab takes 7.6 metres to turn around). Few things are as much fun as flinging an Ami around a mini-roundabout. OK, so the Ami is tiny, noisy, impractical, slow, and won’t actually go very far. Which makes it sound like the worst car ever. And it is, if you compare it to a similarly-priced second hand small hatchback, but that’s not the point. The Ami is designed specifically for short hops, around town, using minimal resources. It’s not a proper car, but it is really good fun. Like the look of the Ami? Why not check out the latest Citroen deals for a great price, or browse used examples for sale from a network of trusted dealers. Want to sell your car first? Well, carwow can help with that, too. How much is the Citroen Ami? How much is the Citroen Ami? In one sense, an Ami is really cheap, coming in at well under £10,000, and being spectacularly cheap to run. It currently has no direct rival, as Fiat UK still hasn’t started selling the Topolino (which is identical under the skin) and Renault has abandoned the tandem-two-seat Twizy (which was even more basic but at least had a 50mph top speed). The problem with the Ami comes when you start comparing it to what you could get in the used car market for the same money, at which point cars such as the Dacia Sandero , the Citroen C3 , and the Ford Fiesta start to pop up on your radar. While they can’t match the smile-factor of the Ami, and nor are they emissions-saving electric models, they are at least proper cars which can all be driven wherever you want to go with ease and in safety. At that point, the Ami is revealed for what it is; an expensive toy. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort The Ami is fun to chuck around city streets, and it’s spectacularly manoeuvrable, but it’s totally out of its depth anywhere else. On city streets, especially those with 20mph zones, the Ami feels like the best idea in motoring for a long time. You sit side-by-side with your passenger, with a superb view out, almost no overhangs at the front or rear (so no need for parking sensors) and a turning circle that you can measure almost with the span of your hands. The Ami really does raise a smile — both from yourself and from others — when you drive it around town. Parking is stupidly easy, even with the left-hand drive and the lack of a rear-view mirror, and the tiny door mirrors. It’s so small, the Ami will actually fit into a supermarket trolley bay… However, there are limitations even in-town. The ride quality is really quite terrible, so even small lumps in the tarmac — like a rumble strip — send a big ‘whump’ up through the plastic body and chassis. The whole structure of the Ami seems to resonate like a smacked drum on bigger bumps. While visibility is good, there’s only one windscreen wiper and it only works on the driver’s side, so there’s a huge area of screen left un-swept. The slow performance and low top speed aren’t a huge problem on small streets, but you do need to watch your driving and plan ahead for hills, as long uphill stretches will make the Ami slow down a lot, and sadly there’s no way of catching up on the downslope, as that 28mph speed limiter will cut in and actually use the braking effect of the electric motor to stop your downhill fun. Technically, you could take the Ami on a motorway, but you really shouldn’t. Really, don’t try it. For a start, with that 28mph maximum, you’ll be a tiny, hard-to-see, rolling menace to everyone else, while inside the Ami you’ll be buffeted by every passing vehicle’s side-draughts, and deafened by the noise coming up from underneath. Deafened, too, by the loud air horns of passing lorries. That 46 mile range will disappear fast if you’re holding the accelerator pedal down all the time, so you might not even make it between junctions. Anyway, while technically the Ami exceeds the minimum power limit of 4kW for motorway use, equally technically the police could nick you for failing to keep up with the flow of traffic, so don’t try it. The Ami is actually fine on slow, narrow country roads, aside from that almost-solid ride quality. Hit a pot-hole and you’ll swear you’ve ripped a wheel off (and indeed, you might have…) but within its narrow limits, the Ami would be perfectly fine for a short rural trip. The suspension is surprisingly sophisticated, with McPherson struts up front, and semi-trailing arms with coil-over shocks on the back, just like a big, proper car. Which doesn’t mean that the ride quality is anything other than dog-rough. The problem, again, would be that low top speed and the small size when the speed limit opens up to 50mph or 60mph, at which point you’ve become something of a liability to yourself and others. Mind you, the Ami is so small that it’s almost as easy to drive backwards as it is forwards, which is a form of entertainment all in itself. Space and practicality Space and practicality Considering how tiny it is, the Ami is reasonably practical, although you have to make the choice between carrying luggage or a passenger. There is some useful stowage space in the Ami, thanks to a broad, concave dashboard, whereby the space between the instruments and the windscreen is filled with useful little multi-purpose trays that include cup holders and small lidded compartments (which reflect annoyingly in that vast windscreen). It’s all very basic, as you might expect, but a good use of the available space. The Ami has possibly the biggest door-bins we’ve ever seen. They’re deep and wide, and use a net to hold things in place, so they actually stretch a little if you need to stuff something big in. A big handbag, a backpack, or a laptop bag will fit in easily. There’s also a little clip-on bag hook on the passenger side, and space in front of the passenger seat for luggage or larger items (or, y’know, the passenger’s legs and feet). For a tiny two-seat car, the Ami is actually pretty practical, even given the total lack of any external storage areas. There is an optional ‘Cargo Kit’ which gives you some hooks, nets, and panels so that the interior can be set up for maximum possible storage. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories The Citroen Ami is incredibly cheap and basic inside, but that’s kind of the point. The phrase that comes to mind when you see the Ami’s interior is ‘hose-out.’ There’s so much simple plastic on show that it almost looks like one of those made-in-one-mould pod bathrooms that you get in some cheap hotels. It’s staggeringly basic — there aren’t even detentes to keep the doors open on a slope or on a windy day. Then again, you get what you need. Aside from possibly the ugliest steering wheel in existence, here’s a small digital display (circa. 1990) which shows your speed, range, and battery level. There are buttons for hazard lights, windscreen demisting, and a regular column stalks (recognisable from old Citroen models, those). There’s a USB socket for charging your phone, but it’s an old Type-A socket, so choose your cable carefully. There’s no stereo, but there is storage space behind the dinky instrument panel for you to stash a Bluetooth speaker, although it’ll need to be a powerful one to compete with the racket in the Ami’s plastic-bucket cabin. There’s a clip that holds your phone in place, so that it can be your infotainment screen, but larger-screen phones might not fit, and it’s not fitted as standard on the basic model. The gear selector is down by your thighs, next to the seat. The windows don’t wind down, but instead have simple flip-up sections, rather like those of an old Citroen 2CV. That’s your air conditioning. There is a basic heater, but it’s noisy and not especially effective. The seats are simple affairs with two vinyl cushions each, but they’re actually surprisingly comfy. The driver’s seat adjusts back and forth, but the passenger’s seat is fixed in place. One nice stylistic touch is that the interior door handles are simple fabric straps, which you pull to pop the catch — a neat race-car-style effect in the cheap and cheerful Ami. All Amis use the same injection-moulded blue-grey plastic inside and out, but you can upgrade that with different stickers and wheel trims if you go for the pricier Colour or Peps versions. Economy, emissions and tax Economy, emissions and tax The Ami isn’t so much cheap to run as practically free. If you’re charging the 5.4kWh battery on night-rate electricity, you might pay as little as 54p for a full charge, capable of carrying you for 46 miles, well within the range of most people’s commutes (motorways excepted…). There’s no need for a home charging box either, just a regular outdoor socket will do, as the Ami comes with its own retracting charging cable with a three-pin plug (and an adaptor so you can charge it from kerbside EV charging points using a Type-2 cable). There’s no tax to pay, as it’s zero emissions. Safety and security Safety and security The Ami qualifies as a quadricycle, so it doesn’t have to pass the same rigorous crash tests as normal road cars, and so the best advice would be to simply not have a crash in the first place. At least any crash that does take place will be at very low speeds, but there’s no airbag for either occupant, so you’ve only got the seatbelts to protect you. On balance, that’s probably enough given the Ami’s limited speed range, but it feels a bit naked when you get in for the first time. There are exterior locks for the doors, but being as the windows flip up to open, is there really even much point in locking them? Reliability and problems Reliability and problems The Ami hasn’t been on sale for long enough for us to get a good idea of how reliable it might be, but then again what is there to go wrong? At worst, you might have to fix a blown fan fuse, or replace a smashed headlight. The Ami has a standard two-year warranty, while the battery is warrantied for three years. There’s an option to extend the warranty out to five years at a cost. Citroen also offers its own specialist insurance for the Ami, as many other providers might not give you a quote for such an esoteric car. Citroen finished a very creditable fifth overall in the most recent Auto Express Driver Power Survey, with only 15 per cent of owners reporting faults with their cars."

Perhaps the way the Citroen Holidays is badged will catch on in the wider world. We might yet end up with the Skoda School Run or the Audi Business Meeting. In the meantime, the appropriately-badged Holidays is Citroen’s entry into the dealer-ready camper van market. Previously, only three car makers had offered turn-key camper vans direct from their dealers — that’s Volkswagen with the three-strong California range, Ford with the Transit-based Nugget, and Mercedes with the V-Class-based Marco Polo. Now, Citroen is joining the fray meaning that you can buy a ready-to-go camper directly from a dealer, with no need to buy a van and then take it to be converted elsewhere. The big benefit to that is that all of the interior fixtures and fittings are specifically designed for the car. Okay, so that means you won’t have as many options for custom-fittings to your own taste, but it also means that everything should work properly, and it all comes with a manufacturer’s warranty. To turn the SpaceTourer MPV (itself based on the Citroen Relay panel van) into a Holidays camper, Citroen has enlisted the services of camper vans expert Bravia Mobil. Together, they’ve stripped out the SpaceTourer’s seats and installed a kitchen with a two-burner gas hob, a 16-litre fridge, and a retractable table. There’s a pop-up roof which means you can stand up in the back when parked up, and that roof also contains a double-bed, which folds down for use at night. There’s also a ‘downstairs’ bed, as the two-seat rear bench folds flat and converts into a comfy double. Of course one of the restrictions of any similarly-sized camper van is that you can only carry as many people as it will sleep, so four — including the driver — is your limit. Cleverly, Citroen has retained the SpaceTourer’s twin sliding side doors — one on each side — for the Holidays, and has designed the kitchen unit so that it be removed for cooking outdoors, which should cut down on any lingering sausage smells inside. There’s also a 10-litre fresh water tank and a 10-litre waste water tank, which should keep you self sufficient for a while, but it’s worth noting that the Ford Nugget offers a 33-litre water tank. There’s also no on-board toilet, although in fairness none of the Holidays’ direct rivals offer that either — you’d have to upgrade to a considerably more expensive VW Grand California for that. There’s a bracket on the side of the roof which can hold a foldaway awning, and for chilly camping nights there’s a Webasto central heating system, powered by a rechargeable 95-amp/hour leisure battery, so you won’t even need to hook up to the campsite’s electricity. As standard, the Citroen Holidays comes with a 180hp 2.0-litre BlueHDI diesel engine, driving the front wheels through an eight-speed automatic gearbox. That makes it a long-legged and economical companion, but Volkswagen offers you the option of plug-in hybrid power for the Multivan-based California camper, while Ford offers the same option for the Transit Nugget. Up in the driver’s cab, the Citroen gets a fairly small — and somewhat fiddly — 10.0-inch touchscreen with Apple CarPlay , Android Auto , and built-in navigation. There’s a ‘Top Rear Vision’ reversing camera too, which makes getting into tight spaces a bit easier, while the overall height of 1.99 metres means that the Holidays should fit under most height restrictors. For safety’s sake, there’s also adaptive cruise control and emergency braking with pedestrian and cyclist detection. Fancy this smart campervan for your getaway?

The Citroen Holidays is, in spite of being very well set up as a camper van, actually the most affordable camper in its segment. It’s around £8,000 cheaper than a VW California (the one based on the Multivan), and a whacking £20,000 cheaper (that’s not a typo) than a Ford Nugget. Oddly, the Mercedes Marco Polo is actually priced at around the same level as the Citroen, but you have to spend quite a bit more on options to bring it up to equipment parity.

https://www.carwow.co.uk/citroen/e-berlingo,Citroen e-Berlingo Review & Prices,"€38,023",7/10,new,"Is the Citroen e-Berlingo a good car? Is the Citroen e-Berlingo a good car? The Citroen e-Berlingo is a car built for a better world. A world where badge snobbery isn’t a thing; where people aren’t taken in by the false idea that a practical family car must be SUV -shaped. The e-Berlingo might be van-based, but it has a quirky character all of its own, and is kind of stylish in an anti-fashion sort of way. Basically, it’s as if JML, that company that advertises on daytime TV, made a car — something that’s so practical, you didn’t realise you needed it. If you’re assuming that being van-based means that the e-Berlingo is going to rattle and smoke with nasty old diesel power, forget it — there is, thanks to customer demand, a diesel Berlingo on sale once again, but this e-Berlingo gets a 136hp electric motor driving the front wheels, which is fed energy from a 54kWh lithium-ion battery. In theory, a full charge of that battery will take you for a total of 212 miles, but to be honest the e-Berlingo will struggle to match that claim. Aim on getting somewhere between 150 and 180 miles if you’re driving in mixed conditions, and probably as little as 140 miles if you’re pounding up and down the motorway. Range: 212 miles Efficiency: 2.8-3.5 miles per kWh Battery size: 54kWh Max charge speed: 100kW Charge time AC: 7-8hrs 0-100% Charge time DC: 30mins 10-80% Charge port location: Left rear Power outputs: 136hp (in Sport mode) The total useable capacity of that battery is 50kWh, and the e-Berlingo charges at up to 100kW from a DC public fast charger , so you can top up fairly quickly, getting from 0% to 80% charge in 30 minutes — although it will be a brave e-Berlingo driver who dares to run the battery down to 0% before connecting to a charger. Charging at home , on a 7.4kW wallbox, will give you a full charge, from flat, in about eight hours. Does that make the e-Berlingo less than practical? Yes, a bit, but it’s great for urban and intra-urban commuters, and there are helpful driving modes — Sport, Normal, and Eco — which can tweak the e-Berlingo’s performance according to your tastes. The e-Berlingo, just like the petrol and diesel models, comes in a choice of sizes. If you only need five seats and fancy a smaller vehicle for parking, then you can have the five-seat M version. If you need more space, there’s a longer model, called the XL, which comes with seven seats. Both versions come in either Plus or Max trim, and standard kit includes lots of safety equipment, folding picnic tables in the back seats, LED headlights (now in a new design featuring angled LED running light bars that look as if someone’s been buying up old nightclub glow-sticks), digital instruments, and a 10.0-inch touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto . High-spec Max models get luxury touches such as dual-zone climate, electric, heated door mirrors, a reversing camera, 17-inch alloy wheels, a heated steering wheel, Citroen’s ‘advanced comfort seats’, and three individual chairs in the back. Either way, the interior feels pretty cheap — it’s all van-grade plastics in there — but you’ll forgive that for the sheer amount of space on offer, and the acreage of practical storage areas. Speaking of which, both e-Berlingo models are almost ridiculously practical. Five-seat models offer 775-litres of boot space, while the seven-seater XL models have 209-litres. The third-row seats can be removed if you need more luggage space. Fold the whole lot down and you get a massive 4,000-litres of cargo space. To drive? Well, it’s a softly sprung electric van with not much range, so no-one is going to be using an e-Berlingo to do laps of Brands Hatch. It’s fine, as long as you’re prepared to take your time. The 136hp motor has enough power, but no more, and you’ll be spending most of your time slowing down to save on range anyway. See how much you can save on a Citroen e-Berlingo with Carwow , and check out the latest deals on all Citroen models . Plus, we've got plenty of used Citroen Berlingos for sale through our trusted dealer network, and you can also sell your car through Carwow . How much does the Citroen e-Berlingo cost? How much does the Citroen e-Berlingo cost? The e-Berlingo is relatively reasonably priced for an electric car, especially if you’re happy compromising on range to get all that interior space. There are several cloned versions of the e-Berlingo sold by some of the other Stellantis Group (the massive conglomerate of which Citroen is part) brands, such as the Peugeot e-Rifter and the Vauxhall Combo Life Electric . There’s also a distantly-related Toyota Proace City Electric , all of which are basically the same as the e-Berlingo, cost about the same, and have the same performance. What gives the e-Berlingo an edge on these cars is that it has a touch more character. Oddly, Renault doesn’t sell the rather handsome Kangoo electric van-based MPV in the UK, which is a shame as it’s pretty nice, but the incoming new electric Renault 4 might make a good rival to the e-Berlingo, in terms of electric performance, and its sheer Frenchness, if not quite spaciousness. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort Electric power is perfectly tuned for urban driving, but the range runs out fast on motorways, and the e-Berlingo is definitely no sports car on twisty roads Thanks to the instant power delivery of electric motors, the e-Berlingo feels pretty nippy from a standing start, up to low-to-medium speeds. Certainly, this is a car which is ideally tuned for in-town driving, as that’s where its power drain is going to be lowest, and therefore where you’ll be able to eke out the most range. As a school-run special, it has few peers. The electric motor also means no engine noise — and certainly no diesel clatter — at low speeds, and the e-Berlingo’s softly-sprung suspension is ideally tuned for speed bumps and urban potholes. The big windows and good all-round visibility help too, and the boxy shape means it’s easy to park, helped by standard rear parking sensors and the Max model’s rear parking camera. The only issue is that the big boxy body tends to amplify any rattles and noises over urban lumps and bumps, which can make the e-Berlingo feels rather cheaper even than it actually is. Don’t go on the motorway in an e-Berlingo. Honestly, don’t. It’s not that it can’t cope in a mechanical sense. The same soft springs that give it an easy-going ride around town work well on big roads too, allowing you to lope along in comfort, and if you’ve upgraded to the Max model, then the Citroen ‘advanced comfort seats’ with their specially designed foam certainly take the sting out of long journeys. Equally helpful are cruise control (not adaptive cruise, though), lane keeping aids , and auto high beam headlights. All that’s fine. The problem is that pushing that big, boxy body through a 70mph headwind just exhausts the battery far too quickly, and you’ll be lucky to squeeze 140 miles out of the e-Berlingo if you’re cruising at the legal limit. Really, for long journeys, it needs a much bigger battery. If you’re a long-haul motorway driver on the regular, and still want an EV, consider a longer-legged Skoda Enyaq instead. It’s worth remembering that selecting between Sport, Normal, and Eco modes doesn’t just change how quickly the accelerator responds, it actually cuts the power down to just 80hp in Eco mode, so remember to flick over to Sport for on-ramps and steep hills. You should totally take an e-Berlingo on a twisty road, as that’s a good way of keeping your electrical energy consumption down, and also finding lots of opportunities to brake and transfer energy back to the battery via regenerative braking . You’ll be expecting the soft e-Berlingo to be a soggy mess on a tight and twisty road, and it kind of is, but it’s not unpleasantly so. It’s really about you accepting the fact that it’s not a Mazda MX-5 and settling into a gentle rhythm of loping along a road at a relatively gentle pace, not being too bothered by the over-light steering or the way the body leans over in the middle of a corner, in classic Citroen fashion. Do that, and the e-Berlingo is actually quite a pleasant thing to drive. Space and practicality Space and practicality The e-Berlingo is massively practical, with seats for up to seven and a huge boot, but the extra seats of the XL model aren’t the roomiest Officially, the e-Berlingo has up to 186 litres of storage space dotted about the cabin in various bins and cubbies. That means that, in the cabin, it has more storage space than some cars can manage in their actual boots. This, then, is a seriously practical car. There are massive door bins (unlined though, so prepare for rattles), chunky cupholders in the traditional van position at the outer edges of the dash, a small storage area below the air conditioning controls which is home to an optional wireless phone charger, a storage locker above the instrument panel, a storage box at the base of the centre console, and there are even two gloveboxes (and a small open storage tray) thanks to the fact that the passenger-side airbag is installed in the roof. Headroom in the back of the e-Berlingo verges on the ridiculous. If you’re the chairperson of your local Top Hat Wearers’ Society then this is the car for you. Rear seat legroom is also very generous, and better than you’d find in the rival short-wheelbase version of the Volkswagen Caddy MPV (which isn’t available in electric form anyway). Max versions get three individual seats in the back (you can add those to the M version with an option pack) which is helpful when it comes to hauling kids around, and there are three ISOFIX anchor points in the back, which is really handy. Rear-seat occupants even get flip-up picnic tables, which are nice to have, but they can’t hold much in the way of weight. The twin sliding rear side doors are hugely helpful when parking in narrow spaces, and if you’ve gone for the XL model, then the seats slide, fold, and flip to make getting in and out of the back easier. There is decent space in the third-row of seven-seat versions, but it’s definitely better for kids than it is for adults. Those third row seats sit slightly higher than the rest, which is good for the view out, but the high-set rear floor means that taller passengers will have their knees up around their earlobes. There’s even more storage space if you go for the optional ‘Modutop’ roof, which incorporates glass panels with drop-down airline-style bins which can keep rear seat passengers occupied for ages. Boot space is definitely the e-Berlingo’s winning card. In M form, with five seats, up to the luggage cover, there’s up to 641 litres of luggage space, which is perhaps good but maybe not exceptional. However, upgrade to the XL model, and fold down the extra boot seats, and there’s a whopping 806 litres to play with. Again, that’s just up to the luggage cover. Start folding the middle row of seats and you can open up 1,849 litres, which is actually slightly less space than the 1,884 litres offered by the M model, which is down to the space taken up by the folded third row. Max models do benefit from tailgate glass that opens separately to the rest of the boot, which is handy if you just want to chuck something small in or are parked too close to something to open the massive tailgate. If you need to tow anything, the M model of the e-Berlingo has a maximum towing weight of 750kg, either braked or unbraked, but the XL isn’t rated for towing at all. Then again, towing anything will put a major dent in your battery range anyway. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories The e-Berlingo’s cabin is made of cheap van-spec plastics, but it’s comfy and rugged The e-Berlingo’s dash is where you can most clearly see its van origins, as if the big cupholders on the outer edges weren’t enough of a clue. The plastics used throughout the cabin are generously referred to as ‘robust’ and that they are. They’re also rough in places, but Citroen has tried to enliven things with jazzy colour options, and brighter trim for the seats in Max models. Digital instruments come as standard, and these offer clear information. The chunky steering wheel gets some nice glossy plastic inserts, and the proper physical buttons on the wheel are easy to use. The little toggle switch for gear selection is neat enough, and the driving mode switch is next to that on the small plinth that juts out from the middle of the dash. There are also two USB-C ports to help top up your gadgets. The 10.0-inch touchscreen infotainment system, standard on the e-Berlingo, is okay to use, and it helps enormously that Citroen has stuck with proper physical buttons for the air conditioning system, but even so the menus are often rather impenetrable, and items that you’ expect to come under one heading are often buried under another. Electric range, charging and tax Electric range, charging and tax With the e-Berlingo being fully electric, and having a small battery, you’re looking at some seriously cheap running costs if you can charge at home, and better yet on a night rate. Charging an e-Berlingo overnight, on the cheapest night rate, 7.9p, means you could get a full charge for just £3.95. Public charging, or charging at peak time, would be more expensive, of course. Still you’ll be paying only £10 for a first year’s VED motor tax , and BIK rates for business users start from just £16. Who cares about range — still just 212 miles, remember — when the running costs are that low? If you are charging on high-speed DC public chargers, then the e-Berlingo can be charged at up to 100kW of power, allowing for a 0-80% charge in 30 minutes. Home charging on a 7.4kW wallbox can take around eight hours. Safety and security Safety and security The e-Berlingo does come with a lot of safety kit as standard, and while it’s based on a van, that van is in turn based on the Citroen EMP2 chassis, which is used under several passenger car models too. The Berlingo was last tested by Euro NCAP in 2018, and it managed a four-star score, with an impressive 91% rating for adult occupant protection, 81% for child occupants, 58% for vulnerable road users, and 68% for its electronic safety systems. As standard, those systems include stability control, ABS brakes, front, side, and rear curtain airbags, lane keeping assistance, automatic emergency braking, speed limit monitoring, automatic high-beam lights, driver attention alert, cruise control, and a speed limiter. There’s an optional pack for Max models which includes extra parking sensors, blind spot monitoring, and upgraded lane keeping with adaptive cruise control. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems Being as it has only one moving part — the electric motor — there’s little enough to worry about when it comes to mechanical issues with the e-Berlingo. There’s a standard three-year warranty, capped at 60,000 miles, but which has unlimited miles for the first two years. There’s an extended warranty available at an extra cost, and the e-Berlingo’s battery is separately warrantied for eight years or 100,000 miles, if it falls below 70% of its original energy storage capacity. Citroen once had a reputation for fragility when it came to reliability, but that seems to be a thing of the past. The Berlingo didn’t feature in the most recent Driver Power survey, but several other Citroen models finished strongly. In the survey of the best car brands, Citroen came in an impressive fifth place out of 32 marques, with only 15.1% of owners reporting faults with their cars — fewer even than Toyota .

Admittedly, the exterior changes are limited to some new badges but thanks to three new paint shades there are now 32 different combinations for the exterior look. The theme of personalisation continues inside where you’ll immediately spot the brightly-coloured central console that holds the standard-fit 7-inch touchscreen infotainment. You can connect your Apple or Android device to the system and enjoy sat-nav and other features. But, it’s still a touchscreen, making it a tad tricky to use while driving. You won’t be stretching out in the front of the C1 Airscape and the rear seat space is very tight for adults. However, the driver can at least find a comfortable driving position thanks to a good range of adjustment, so the C1 isn’t so bad if there’s only two along for the ride. It only takes a few bags of shopping to fill the C1 Airscape’s boot, and you’ll be using the back seats as extra storage for anything like a weekly visit to the supermarket. You can fold the seat backs down and enjoy a pretty large luggage area for the size of the car, but if you want something more practical, have a look at the Hyundai i10. If you’re looking for the most affordable drop-top, the C1 Airscape is a fair shout. Just don’t plan on taking back-seat passengers very often. Unlike the i10, you can only get the C1 Airscape with one engine – a 1.2-litre petrol making 72hp. That’s pretty weedy even by small car standards, and you’ll find yourself driving the C1 Airscape like your hair’s on fire just to keep up with traffic. Driving like that inevitably makes the fuel economy plummet so if you want to get close to the official average fuel economy of 69mpg be ready to have a long trail of cars behind you waiting to overtake. Put simply, The C1 Airscape is a car that’s designed to excel in tight city streets. Drive the C1 Airscape at anything more than city speeds and you’ll hear lots of wind noise which makes it tiresome on long journeys. On the upside, the suspension does a good job of ironing out bumps in the road. So, if you’re set on the looks, want to drive with the roof down as frequently as possible without spending a huge sum of money, then the C1 Airscape is a fair choice. However, bare in mind that there are better open-tops such as the Mazda MX-5 for not much more money, and better city cars for less such as the Skoda Citigo."

The Citroen C3 Aircross is a really difficult car to classify. Technically, it’s a seven-seater SUV, but if you compare it with cars like the Volvo XC90 or Skoda Kodiaq you’re going to be confused. That’s because the C3 Aircross packs all seven of its seats into a body that’s barely 10cm longer than a Volkswagen Golf . It’s over a foot shorter than the aforementioned Kodiaq, and shares its mechanicals, interior, styling and technology with the bargain-priced Citroen C3 . So if a Skoda Kodiaq is a holiday in Centerparcs, the C3 Aircross is like finding your own cabin on Airbnb instead. You’re probably going to pay a lot less, but you’ll likely have a much less polished experience. Outwardly, you won’t notice much difference between the C3 Aircross and the regular C3 hatch. You get the same upright, boxy silhouette, with quite a rugged-looking front grille and headlight arrangement which gives it much more of an SUV flavour. They flank a massive Citroen roundel, which definitely helps the front of the car stand out. Two-tone paintwork, plastic cladding on the wheelarches and chunky bumpers add to the beefy, off-road aesthetic. The differences from the regular C3 come once you get to the rear, where you’ll find more of the body overhanging the rear wheels and a longer roofline - hinting at the Aircross’s greater practicality. The greater interior space has been put to use in one of two ways. You can get a five-seater version, which has much more legroom than the regular C3 and a much bigger boot - 460 litres, versus just 310 litres in the regular hatch. The really interesting thing is that you can get a C3 Aircross with seven seats. This makes it the smallest and one of the cheapest seven-seaters on sale, and an alternative to cars like the Dacia Jogger or Citroen’s own Berlingo . Seats six and seven have precious little space for adults, but they’ll suit children very well. The main issue with squeezing so much passenger accommodation into such a small car is that when all seats are in place, the boot’s basically nonexistent. Forget a suitcase - you’d struggle to fit a picture of a suitcase in there. Up front, the dashboard is the same simplistic affair as the regular C3. The minimalist digital instrument panel is nice and clear and while the infotainment system is basic it does offer pretty much everything you really need. You can choose between a standard petrol engine with a manual gearbox, or a hybrid engine which comes with an automatic. Neither are particularly quick, but the hybrid has more low-down grunt and would feel more up to the task of ferrying seven passengers around. There’s also an all-electric e-C3 Aircross (reviewed separately) which comes as a five-seater only.

And remember that Carwow can even help you to sell your old car when the time comes. How much is the Citroen C3 Aircross? How much is the Citroen C3 Aircross? The C3 Aircross is, considering the space and tech on offer, an absolute bargain. The basic petrol model costs just over £20,000 - a bit more expensive than the Dacia Jogger, but you get much more equipment as standard. Air-conditioning, wireless smartphone connectivity, rear camera and LED headlights are all very nice to have when you consider the basic Jogger doesn’t even get a touchscreen. Stepping up to the higher Max trim costs about £5,000 because it doesn’t come with the entry-level petrol engine - just the hybrid. However, it does come with navigation, wireless charging and extra safety equipment. Regardless of which version you go for, you’re getting a well-equipped and roomy SUV for the same price as most small hatchbacks. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort Great to drive around town, but feels a bit outclassed on the motorway The C3 Aircross is fantastic to drive around the city. Even the 100hp petrol engine feels peppy enough for nipping about - though we can imagine if the car was fully loaded with passengers and luggage it might be a bit sluggish. The 136hp hybrid is more powerful and comes with an automatic gearbox which makes life extra relaxing. Though it can be a bit noisy when the engine kicks in, it’s relaxed in traffic because you can coast along on the electric motor alone. Whichever engine you choose, the C3 Aircross has Citroen’s ‘Advanced Comfort’ suspension. This has a hydraulic element a bit like Citroens of old, and it means that over big bumps you get just a bit more cushioning than you do in alternatives. The C3 Aircross copes really well with big potholes and speed bumps, though the lighter C3 is even more comfortable still. The steering is super-light, visibility is good and all models get rear parking sensors and a reversing camera - so manoeuvring around the tight city streets is easy. The C3 Aircross’ suspension makes it very comfortable on the motorway, too, where things like expansion joints and rumble strips don’t really disturb the cabin too much. There are SUVs much more expensive than this which feel less relaxing on a long drive. There’s not an awful lot of power in reserve from either of the engines, though, and the C3 Aircross is lightweight, tall and slab-sided - all of which mean it’s quite susceptible to crosswinds. All of these criticisms can certainly be levelled at the Dacia Jogger, though - so it’s not as if the C3 Aircross is notably worse than the alternatives on this front. With light, accurate steering and a surprising amount of grip in the corners, the C3 Aircross isn’t unenjoyable to drive down a twisty road - but the soft suspension means it leans a lot in the bends and there isn’t a lot of grunt from the engines to power out of corners. Like the Dacia Jogger, the C3 Aircross feels much nicer if you take it a little easier. Taking corners more slowly will definitely keep your passengers happier, too. Space and practicality Space and practicality Seven seats in a tiny package is impressive, but brings some compromises The C3 Aircross puts roominess at the top of its priority list. Up front, it’s every bit as practical as the regular C3, with comfortable seats and reasonable space for small items. There are big cupholders and a phone shelf in the centre - on the Max trim, this contains a wireless charging pad. The door bins are a good size, and so is the glovebox. Max models also get a central armrest with a little extra storage under it. The dashboard has a wide, fabric-covered shelf which you could potentially leave smaller items on, though they won’t stay there if you’re cornering hard. You can get the C3 Aircross with five or seven seats. Five-seater models have the rear bench pushed back, giving impressive rear legroom - it’s on par with many much larger and more expensive SUVs, and ideal if you like the regular Citroen C3 but need more room in the rear seats. With ISOFIX points on the outer rear seats, the extra legroom makes it much easier to install child seats without having to slide the front seats uncomfortably far forward. There’s also a seven-seater version of the C3 Aircross. This has the middle row in the same place it is in the regular C3 - so legroom is modest, but suitable for adults. Fold the middle row out of the way and you get a reasonably-sized opening to clamber back to the third row of seats. Once in place, you’ll find there’s plenty of room for kids, but adults would be better avoiding it except for very short journeys. There’s more room in a Dacia Jogger. Rear occupants don’t really get much other than a seat and a seatbelt - it’s not exactly luxurious. The five-seater model gets a pretty good 460-litre boot - an appreciable upgrade over the 310 litres you get in the regular Citroen C3. You get 565 litres in a Dacia Jogger when the third row is folded, though, and a five-seat Volkswagen T-Cross has 455 litres. The seven-seat C3 Aircross gets 330 litres when the third row is folded, which is about the same size as most small hatchbacks. The rear seatbacks do leave quite big gaps around them, down which small items could fall, so Citroen provides a couple of fold-out panels to form a boot floor. It’s not the most elegant solution, but it does work. With all seven seats in place, the C3 Aircross basically doesn’t have a boot. Citroen claims there’s 40 litres of space, but you’d be hard pushed to even squeeze a small bag of shopping behind the rear seatbacks. So you can have seven passengers, but not their luggage unless you’re willing to put it on a roof rack or have the passengers carry their suitcases on their laps. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories Simple interior is easy to use but quite basic The C3 Aircross has been built to a price but unlike in the Dacia Jogger where corner-cutting is really obvious, it’s quite nicely hidden in the Citroen. The materials are all quite cheap, but they’re used cleverly. Citroen’s added a big swathe of fabric trim across the centre of the dash which makes a change from black plastic and feels pleasant, and the steering wheel and gear selector both feel pretty classy. Where it’s noticeable more is in the digital offering. The C3 Aircross doesn’t get a big, high-resolution display for the driver information - it gets a narrow strip just beneath the windscreen which displays the essentials and nothing much else. There’s also a 10.25-inch infotainment screen which is notably lower-spec than the one in Citroen’s bigger cars, and also runs a simplified operating system. That’s actually not a bad thing at all, as it’s a little easier to use - and since it comes as standard with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto , you don’t really need to use it unless you want to. MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax No version of the C3 Aircross should cost a lot to run. The basic petrol engine claims up to 47mpg, while the hybrid should be slightly more efficient with an official figure of 53mpg. Over a 50-mile mixed test route in the hybrid, we managed 46mpg, which is pretty good. However, you should expect this figure to go down significantly if you’re making the most of all those seats… CO2 emissions are 136g/km for the petrol or 120g/km for the hybrid, meaning neither are particularly good company cars - a Dacia Jogger hybrid has a lower output at 108g/km. A plug-in hybrid will save you much more if you’re looking for a good company car choice, though. Safety and security Safety and security The C3 Aircross hasn’t yet been tested by Euro NCAP - nor has the C3 that it’s based on. Both cars have underpinnings originally designed for cheaper models in developing countries, and so crash prevention isn’t necessarily at the top of the priority list - the Indian-market C3, for example, scored very poorly when tested by Global NCAP. However, the European model receives significant changes under the skin as well as a lot more safety equipment, so while it may never achieve the lofty heights of a full five-star rating it’s likely to at least be passable. The main alternative, the Dacia Jogger, holds just a one-star rating. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems Citroen performed well in the 2024 Driver Power owner satisfaction survey , coming fifth out of 32 brands. Several of its models returned impressive ratings individually, too. The C3 Aircross uses tried-and-tested components and is a pretty simple car overall, so you should be able to count on strong reliability. The main warranty is three years and 60,000 miles, but Citroen also offers a new service-backed warranty on the powertrain of up to eight years or 100,000 miles.

While most other family SUVs seem determined to put the ‘sport’ into Sport Utility Vehicle, the Citroen C5 Aircross stands out from the crowd by being unashamedly comfort-focused, with a generous sprinkling of chic style thrown into the mix. It’s a bit like a pair of designer jogging bottoms hanging up in a shop full of polyester tracksuits. And just like the countless leisurewear options at your disposal, if you’re looking for a family SUV at Citroen C5 Aircross prices, you’re spoilt for choice. There’s about a dozen that range from the practical and affordable Skoda Karoq and Nissan Qashqai , to the premium-but-not-quite Peugeot 3008 and Volkswagen Tiguan . Budget stretches further? The posh BMW X1 and Audi Q3 enter the mix. Despite all this choice, the Citroen C5 Aircross marks itself out from the gaggle. It's so good we awarded it Highly Commended in the Comfortable Cruiser category of the 2025 Carwow Car of the Year Awards . The C5 Aircross has chic styling, with soft edges where most alternatives offer sharp angles. Soft does not mean dull though, because it has an upright front end that gives it real presence and chunky body cladding that results in cute-off-roader vibes, with a 2023 update bringing an even classier look. It’s stylish inside, too. The dashboard design doesn’t quite give off the upmarket ambience of an Audi or BMW , but you get big, comfy seats and there’s loads of space and storage in the front. It’s not all rosy though, because while the digital displays are big and easy to read, the infotainment isn’t the most intuitive to use. Headroom is a bit tight in the back, too. Fortunately there’s a big boot to make up for this, and the rear seats can slide forward for more boot space and less legroom if required. With the seats forward, nothing else can match the space on offer, but even in the regular position you only get more capacity in the Hyundai Tucson and Kia Sportage . There’s a bit less space in the plug-in hybrid , but again, it’s more than other hybrids you might consider. This means you don’t need to sacrifice much practicality for the frugal hybrid, which will offer the lowest running costs if you can keep the batteries topped up. Don’t have access to a charger? You might consider the mild hybrid, or the diesel if you do a lot of long-distance driving. If you do spend a lot of time behind the wheel, the C5 Aircross is a comfortable companion, thanks to the big, cosseting seats and soft suspension. This is also noticeable around town, where the high driving position and large windows give good visibility, though this comfort focus does mean it rather lumbers through corners. A SEAT Ateca is more fun on a countryside jaunt, for sure. That’s not really what this big, comfy Citroen is all about, though. While its chunky buttons and occasional scratchy plastics mean you won’t immediately confuse it with a posh German option, it’s less expensive than those cars and feels well-made. It’s also really practical and if you don’t need your family SUV to do an impression of a sports car from time to time it’s a lovely thing to motor round in. Sound like your cup of tea?

You can also browse other used Citroens , and when it’s time to sell your car , Carwow can help with that, too. How much is the Citroen C5 Aircross? How much is the Citroen C5 Aircross? The Citroen C5 Aircross is competitively priced with loads of other family SUVs. The range starts at just under £30,000 for the petrol and just over for the diesel, with plug-in hybrids costing closer to £40,000 (partly because you can’t get one on the entry level trim). You could spend all day looking at other alternatives in this price range, but the highlights include the Skoda Karoq, Peugeot 3008 and Hyundai Tucson, which offer similar practicality and driving pleasure for the price. The Nissan Qashqai is another good choice, but it has a considerably smaller boot. If you’re looking at the top end of the Citroen’s price range, you might also consider the Audi Q3 and BMW X1, with the latter also available with a plug-in hybrid option, though it’s a bit more expensive than the equivalent C5 Aircross. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort The Citroen C5 Aircross is really comfortable for long drives and around town, but it’s not the most fun car on a winding road Driving around town is easy in the Citroen C5 Aircross because you sit fairly high – almost in a van-like driving position – and the large windows mean that your view out the front and sides is really good. Visibility out of the back is a bit limited, but you do get front and rear parking sensors and a reversing camera as standard, which help matters. On the move, the C5 Aircross comes into its own. It has ‘comfort suspension’, which basically means that you waft along the road, ironing out imperfections even when the road is in poor condition. The 'Hybrid 136' version is fine, but it's a bit clunky switching between electric and petrol power at lower speeds, which knocks its overall refinement. The plug-in hybrid is more expensive to buy, but if you're able to regularly charge the batteries, it's the better option because it's so pleasant at lower speeds when running on electric power alone. It makes stop-start traffic about as chilled as can be. The electric motors are responsive and you rarely notice when the petrol engine chimes in to offer a helping hand. Perhaps the only complaint is that the brakes are a bit inconsistent, which is likely related to the hybrid system’s regenerative braking that helps top the battery up. Coupled with the soft suspension it can be difficult to come to a smooth stop, occasionally rocking back and forth if you brake a bit too hard. Head out of town and the C5 Aircross is just as comfortable on a long motorway drive. There’s little in the way of tyre and wind noise, and the suspension smooths out bumps and cracks in the road. You also don’t have to worry about the gentle wallowing that can sometimes be a problem in cars with soft suspension, instead the car just settles down to a nice cruise. Standard kit includes lane assist and basic cruise control, but you’ll have to step up a grade to Shine to get adaptive cruise control , which keeps pace with the car in front. This trim also adds blind spot monitoring, which makes life easier when changing lines, as visibility over your shoulder isn’t brilliant. A hands-on semi-autonomous motorway assist system is included on top-spec models, too. There’s always a compromise when a car is so comfortable in town and on the motorway, and as is the case with the C5 Aircross, that comes in its abilities to excite in corners. It’s not that it’s completely unwieldy in the bends, but there’s quite a bit of lean from the body and the light steering doesn’t offer much feedback, so you don’t get a good sense of grip when pressing on. No, the C5 Aircross prefers a more leisurely way of life, and the driving experience actually encourages you to take it easy. If you want something that’s a bit less comfy and practical, but more enjoyable on a twisty road, the SEAT Ateca should be your first port of call. Space and practicality Space and practicality The clever sliding seats are great for prioritising between passengers and bulky luggage, but tall people will still struggle in the back There’s plenty of space for those in the front, with lots of adjustability in the steering wheel so it’s easy to get a good driving position. You also retain a pretty commanding view even with the seat in its lower positions. Storage is ample, too, with a massive space under the arm rest and two cupholders just in front. Ahead of this is a usefully deep space that is good for keys and other bits and bobs, along with a large slot for your phone. The door bins are okay, but you will struggle to get big water bottles in. Otherwise, the only real letdown is the tiny glovebox. The centre console is also home to a couple of USB-A slots (newer, faster USB-C slots would be preferable for some), as well as a 12V socket. Although space in the front is pretty good, it’s not quite so good in the back seats. Legroom isn’t too bad, but tall passengers might find their knees rest against the seats in front, and will almost certainly brush their heads on the roof. The middle seat is comfortable but you are perched quite high compared to the outer seats, and three adults will find shoulder room a bit tight. The Kia Sportage and Skoda Karoq are all a bit more spacious in the second row. Practicality isn’t brilliant in the back either, with slim door bins that are actually quite tricky to access down the side of the seat. You don’t have a centre armrest, and there’s just the one USB slot – again, not the newer USB-C variety – so the kids will have to take it in turns to charge their devices. At least the rear seats move forwards and backwards, so if you have kids or shorter adults in the back, you can prioritise boot space if required, which is a useful feature only seen in a few alternatives. If you’re fitting a child seat, there’s enough space to make it easy enough, and the ISOFIX points aren’t hidden away so you won’t be fishing around to get everything hooked up. Bulkier seats might mean those in front might have to sit a bit closer to the dashboard than they would like, but it’s nothing drastic. What the Citroen C5 Aircross lacks in rear seat space, it makes up for in the boot. With the seats in the normal position, you get a 580-litre capacity, but push them forward and you open up 720 litres. Even in the smallest layout, only the Hyundai Tucson (620 litres) and Kia Sportage (591 litres) have it beat. Push the seats forward and nothing compares; you can pull a similar stunt with the rear seats in the Audi Q3 and Volkswagen Tiguan to reveal 675 litres and 615 litres of space respectively, but either way, the Citroen wins. Because the batteries are stored beneath the floor, plug-in hybrid models are down on boot space, so you get between 460 and 600 litres, depending on the rear seat position. Most alternatives face the same issue, and compared like-for-like, the C5 Aircross comes out on top again. Looking specifically at plug-in hybrid options, you get 558 litres in the Tucson, 540 litres in the Sportage, and 490 litres in the BMW X1. The boot isn't just big, either. It’s a good square space that makes it easy to pack large items in, and it’s not too far off the floor with only a minimal lip, so heavier objects cause little fuss. You also get under-floor storage that’s good for the charging cables in the plug-in model. Perhaps the only real complaint is that there are no latches in the boot to fold the rear seats, so you have to reach in or go in through the back doors. With the seats folded down you get 1,510 litres to play with, which is about the same as what you get elsewhere. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories Although it doesn’t quite have the premium feeling of an Audi or BMW, the interior looks good and has plenty of soft-touch materials Inside the Citroen C5 Aircross is not quite as eye-catching as the exterior, but that’s not to say it isn’t easy on the eye. The design is quite simple and continues the curvaceous edges seen on the outside. There are some chunky buttons that combine with the infotainment graphics so you don’t quite feel like you’re competing with the sophistication of the likes of the Audi Q3 and BMW X1, but the C5 Aircross has a chic character all of its own. It’s certainly more interesting than the comparatively drab cabins you find in the SEAT Ateca and Volkswagen Tiguan. And while there are some scratchy plastics to be found, most of the stuff you regularly touch is soft and feels pretty posh. The Alcantara seat upholstery found on mid-spec Shine models is particularly lovely. The infotainment screen sits nestled between the air vents and is integrated better than most alternatives, which tend to look like a tablet has been stuck to the top of the dashboard. There’s a bank of touch-sensitive shortcut buttons beneath the screen to make navigating between menus easier, but it’s still not the most intuitive system to use outside of the basic functions. At least it’s pretty quick to respond to your inputs, and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are included as standard, so you can stream your music and use your phone’s maps easily. There are four interior ‘ambiences’ depending on which trim you choose, with combinations of synthetic leather, fabric and Alcantara upholstery. A £1,000 Nappa leather option is available on top-spec cars. All of them use dark shades, which can make it a little dull inside, so the glass sunroof (optional on the middle spec, standard on the top spec) helps make it feel more bright and airy inside. MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax There are four engine options – a plug-in hybrid, mild hybrid, petrol and diesel. The plug-in hybrid is the most expensive to buy, but it could offset the extra cost through much lower running costs over your time with the car if you can charge regularly. It combines a 1.6-litre petrol engine with an electric motor for 224hp, and the battery provides up to 41 miles of electric-only range. As a result, CO2 emissions are really low at just 32g/km, meaning first-year road tax is almost nothing and company car tax is very low, too. Officially, fuel economy is up to 222mpg, but you will only see this if you keep the batteries topped up and stick to relatively short journeys. If regular charging isn’t possible, the 136hp mild hybrid will probably be a better bet. Although it’s not a proper self-charging hybrid, it has an electric motor that can take over at low speeds and when manoeuvring to help reduce fuel costs. Official figures suggest 53.3mpg is possible, though we saw around 43mpg in our time with the car, which is respectable. Both petrol and diesel engines have 130hp and come with a choice of six-speed manual or eight-speed automatic gearboxes (the hybrids are auto only). In both cases, the automatics will cost slightly more in first-year road tax, but even then it’s not a huge jump. For those looking for maximum fuel economy, the manual diesel is the best bet, as official figures show up to 60mpg on the combined cycle. This will suit those who do a lot of motorway miles in particular. Safety and security Safety and security The Citroen C5 Aircross has a slightly disappointing four-star safety rating from Euro NCAP – but the UK gets the kit needed to bring it up to the full five stars included as standard. It scored well in the adult and child occupant categories, at 87% and 86% respectively, but lost marks for vulnerable road user protection. Standard safety kit includes front and side airbags for those in front, with head curtain airbags covering both rows of seats, as well as ISOFIX mounting points in the outer rear seats as well as the front passenger. The standard safety pack includes an automatic braking system if the car detects an imminent impact, and a lane departure warning that gently tugs at the wheel to stop you drifting out of your lane. Mid-spec models get blind spot monitoring and adaptive cruise control, while top-spec versions build on this with Highway Driver Assist, which can also steer the car to keep centred in the lane. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems Although there haven’t been any glaring issues with the C5 Aircross, there have been a few question marks over the long-term durability of interior trim, which could be worth bearing in mind for those with young kids in particular, who might enjoy poking and prodding more than most. Otherwise, Citroen is doing a good job of building its reputation for reliability, and has been scoring fairly well in owner satisfaction surveys in recent years, but its cars are by no means bullet-proof. The three-year/60,000-mile warranty isn’t much to shout about either, which probably won’t improve peace of mind. If this is a concern, you get five years with the Hyundai Tucson and seven years with the Kia Sportage."

The Citroen e-SpaceTourer is the ideal vehicle for someone who needs to take a lot of people a decent distance, and doesn’t want to be hassled with the noise and fuss of an internal-combustion engine. The e-SpaceTourer is a sister vehicle to the Peugeot e-Traveller minibus, and comes in two forms – Business costs £45,600 (after the government plug-in car grant), and Feel will set you back a post-grant £46,250. A 50kWh battery brings a range of 143 miles, and you can recharge it using either a three-pin wall socket (slow), a 7.4kW home wallbox (0-100% in 7.5 hours), an 11kW workplace wallbox (0-100% in around five hours) or a public rapid charger (up to 100kW), which will give you an 80% charge in around half an hour. The clue is in the Business trim name, because it’s aimed at commercial users. It can carry up to nine people, although the seating can be configured in a very short period for your own needs. Feel, meanwhile, is available as a five-, seven- or eight-seater. It is aimed at large or extended families, groups and those who like to travel with friends. The sliding seats allow you to change the interior for optimum boot volume or more legroom for those who want it. The seats have reclining backrests and can each be folded down to form a flat ‘shelf’ (front passenger seats as well as Rows 2 and 3), making it possible to transport the most bulky objects for leisure or home use in no time at all. There’s a new MyCitroen smartphone app that allows you to monitor charging remotely, pre-warm the car, find your e-SpaceTourer in a car park, and tell you when its next service is due. Citroen has also formed a partnership with PodPoint in the UK for the supply of wallboxes either at home or work. Better still, there’s an extended five-year warranty on these for Citroen customers. The Citroen e-SpaceTourer is no plodding bus, either, because it has a top speed of 80mph from its 100kW electric motor. The drive can choose between three drive modes. First up, Eco lessens the power of the air-conditioning system and reduces the motor’s power output to 60kW to maximise range. restricts acceleration and reduces heating and air-conditioning power in order to maximise range, Normal allows the motor to produce 80kW and is a balance between Eco and Power, which allows the motor to produce its full 100kW for driving enjoyment and overtaking. The motor recovers energy under braking or during deceleration. Two energy recovery modes are available to the driver – ‘Standard’ for a feel close to that of a conventional engine, ‘Enhanced’ for increased deceleration when releasing the accelerator pedal. This latter mode is accessible via the ‘Brake’ button on the gearbox control. UK e-SpaceTourers will be 4.95 metres long, and will have a 3.27-metre wheelbase. Five-seat models will have 2,381 litres of luggage space available when all five seats are filled. We have yet to drive the Citroen e-SpaceTourer but will let you know what it’s like as soon as we do.

The three seats in the back easily sit adults and have a wide range of adjustability. The boot, meanwhile, is one of the biggest in class. If you’re not familiar with the SpaceTourer name, it used to be called the Citroen C4 Picasso. Comfort is a very sought-after characteristic when choosing an MPV and the Citroen C4 SpaceTourer has the most cosseting ride in its class. It’s also quiet at motorway speeds, but tends to roll a bit in corners. There is a broad choice of engines for the Citroen C4 SpaceTourer – all are modern and refined and, in the case of the diesels, very cheap to run. The 115hp diesel is recommended by experts for it’s impressive fuel economy, while if you plan to only travel short urban trips, then the 130hp petrol makes more sense. Equipment levels are generous with entry-level cars getting air-conditioning, all-round electric windows, a seven-inch touchscreen infotainment system and a panoramic windscreen as standard.

The low weight helps improve fuel economy (along with a range of frugal engines) and importantly, it’s comfortable and spacious. If you don’t need more than that – and relish a bit of French style – it’s possibly the car for you."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/citroen/grand-c4-spacetourer,Citroen Grand C4 SpaceTourer Review and Prices,"€33,249",7/10,new,"The Citroen Grand C4 SpaceTourer is a roomy seven-seat MPV with a massive boot and an eye-catching design that helps it stand out from the likes of the Volkswagen Touran, Kia Carens and Ford S-Max. The current model was launched in 2013 but received a few styling tweaks in 2016 to keep it looking fresh. If you are unfamiliar with the name, it used to be called the Citroen Grand C4 Picasso. Thankfully, Citroen didn’t change too much of the old car’s already futuristic interior. You get plenty of plush plastics dotted around its minimalist cabin and the same neat central speedometer. It certainly feels more special inside than the comparatively bland Touran, but its confusing infotainment system can’t hold a candle to VW’s super-intuitive touchscreen. Sure, you get sat-nav and smartphone mirroring as standard in all but entry-level Touch cars, but the sluggish menus and fiddly on-screen buttons for the climate control make it quite tricky to use on the move. What the Citroen C4 Grand SpaceTourer lacks in easy-to-use infotainment, it claws back in passenger space. There’s room for six-foot-tall adults to sit in all three rows (for short journeys at least) and you can fit a child seat to each of the separate sliding middle seats. The futuristic-looking Citroen C4 Grand SpaceTourer makes other boxy MPVs look like they belong in an episode of the Flintstones Sadly, it’s not all good news. Folding the Citroen C4 Grand SpaceTourer’s middle and rearmost seats down is much more difficult than in the VW and Kia. Thankfully, once you’ve faffed about with the many tethers and carpeted covers you’ll open up a huge boot that’s streets ahead of the Touran and Carens. If you plan to regularly fill your Citroen C4 Grand SpaceTourer’s seven seats or do plenty of long journeys, you’ll want to pick a 120hp 1.6-litre diesel model – it’s cheaper to buy and more frugal than the bigger 2.0-litre diesel. If short trips around town are more your thing, the 1.2-litre petrol will be right up your street. Whichever model you pick, you’ll find the Citroen C4 Grand SpaceTourer easy to drive. Its huge windows and light steering make it relatively easy to thread through tight city streets – for a bulky MPV, at least – although it isn’t as comfortable as the VW and leans more in tight corners. It might not come with quite the same amount of high-tech safety kit as the Touran but the more affordable Citroen Grand C4 SpaceTourer is still a safe and hugely practical large family car that’ll be just as happy on the school run as it will be helping you move house."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/citroen/c4-cactus,Citroen C4 Cactus Review and Prices,"€24,991",6/10,new,"The Citroen C4 Cactus is a stylish small family car that looks more mainstream than the previous model. However, it isn’t as spacious or as practical as some of the alternatives, like the Renault Captur. Where it’s streets ahead of those models, though, is that no other car provides more comfort per pound than the Citroen C4 Cactus. The combination of its sofa-like seats and clever suspension means you glide you up the road, totally relaxed. When the first Citroen C4 Cactus was launched back in 2014, it was genuinely unique, a model that didn’t look like any other Citroen, let alone anything from another car maker. Its flat face, novel light layout and door-mounted Airbumps (plastic cladding that warded off chips and scrapes) made it stand out in any car park, but when this revised version of the car appeared in 2018, many of those stand-out features were toned down and, in some cases, gone completely. However, it’s still a distinctive car that allows plenty of personalisation. Not only is there a wide range of body colours to choose from, you can also add various combinations of coloured highlights, alloy wheels and roof bars to make your Cactus very much your car. Inside, though, the 2018 update brought in far less change, and the slick, minimalist dashboard, free-standing touchscreen infotainment system and upwards-opening glovebox make it feel more special than most small family cars. You even get seats with a special foam filling that Citroen claims makes then more comfortable than ever. As a result, you’ll have no trouble getting comfy, and the Citroen C4 Cactus’ relatively high roof means you get plenty of headroom – even if you’re very tall. The rear seat is wide enough for three adults to sit side-by-side without fighting over elbow room, but anyone over six feet tall will find the headroom tight, especially if you fit the optional panoramic sunroof. The Citroen C4 Cactus can carry a reasonable amount of luggage, too, but its high boot lip does make loading very heavy items more difficult than in other family cars. Thankfully, there’s still space in the boot for a baby buggy and you can fit in a bike once you’ve folded the back seats down, although they don’t sit completely flat. The C4 Cactus’ name might suggest it’s some kind of prickly desert-bound off-roader but in fact it’s a comfortable and economical two-wheel-drive family car If you plan on regularly filling the rear seats and boot – or doing plenty of long journeys – you should consider a diesel engine. The BlueHDi model will have no trouble pulling you and four friends up a steep hill and it’s fast enough to keep up with motorway traffic. Spend more time driving in town? Then, pick a petrol engine instead. The mid-range 110hp unit gives the best balance of performance and running costs, but you should avoid the cheaper 82hp version, which simply isn’t quick enough. Whichever engine you pick, the Citroen C4 Cactus will be comfortable to drive. Other than the most basic Feel Edition, every model comes with a clever suspension system that helps it iron out potholes better than almost any other small car. You also get thick glass in the windows and windscreen to help keep down wind noise at speed. The car is also pretty relaxing to drive around town. Its raised ride height gives you a good view out and the fairly light controls help you fight your way through traffic and squeeze into tight parking spaces without breaking into a sweat. Despite what you may think, though, no Cactus comes with the option of four-wheel drive. If you do need to take your Citroen C4 Cactus away from Tarmac, consider the optional Grip Control system – an advanced traction control system that comes with all-season tyres and gives the car some degree of ability off-road. Pick a top-spec Flair model and you’ll also get all the latest high-tech equipment to keep you safe, including automatic emergency city braking that’ll help stop the car quickly if it senses an obstacle ahead. All in all, this makes the Citroen C4 Cactus a well-rounded family car that’s certainly worth a look if you want to stand out from the crowd without sacrificing everyday practicality."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/citroen/c5-x,Citroen C5 X Review & Prices,"€41,888",9/10,new,"Is the Citroen C5 X a good car? Is the Citroen C5 X a good car? If you can’t make up your mind about what type of car you need, then the Citroen C5 X seems to offer a bit of everything. You could say it’s a bit like ordering the ‘special’ fried rice from your local Chinese takeaway. There’s a bit of bulky SUV in the mix, as well as a dash of practical estate and sleek hatchback – all of which combine to make a concoction that maybe doesn’t look immediately appetising at first glance, but is actually rather delicious when you tuck in. Given the weird mash-up, the alternatives you might also consider are pretty varied. Price-wise, everything from a Cupra Formentor to a Volkswagen Tiguan or a Skoda Superb Estate might also be on your shopping list; but the Citroen’s quirkiness certainly does at least help it to stand out from the crowd more than those models. It looks pretty distinctive on the inside, too. Soft, spongy leather upholstered seats mix with wood-effect trims and soft-touch plastics to lend the C5 X an appealing lounge-like ambience. Meanwhile, the infotainment system looks good and is easy enough to use – but it’s not the most responsive set-up in the world and you’ll possibly just default to using Apple CarPlay or Android Auto anyway. There’s loads of adjustability in the driving position, and the second row of seats is cavernous – even taller adults will find they’ve got a good amount of space to play with to get comfortable. There are a number of handy door bins and cubby holes for stashing your various odds and ends away, and the 545-litre boot is easily large enough to carry a couple of bulky suitcases and plenty of other luggage. As far as engines go, you’ve currently got three different options, although fans of Citroen’s famous diesels will be disappointed, and there’s no manual option either. Two are petrol motors, developing 130hp and 180hp respectively, and which drive the front wheels through an eight-speed automatic transmission. Then there’s the 225hp plug-in hybrid model, which combines a petrol engine with a larger battery and a secondary electric motor for an official all-electric range of 34 miles – though you’ll get much less than that out in the real world. This model makes the most sense if you are a company car driver as there are big tax benefits, although it’s not the most competitive tax rate thanks to the relatively low electric-only mileage. It’s also a bit pricier than the petrol models, so makes less sense as a private car. Our favourite is the 180hp petrol model. The engine is generally quiet and refined at a cruise, but at lower speeds the transmission can be a bit jerky. The stop-start system that cuts the engine when you’re at a standstill can be a bit over-eager too, occasionally causing you to lurch to a sudden halt as you’re pulling up to the lights. The C5 X’s ride is however extremely comfortable, bringing back fond memories of classic big Citroens. Around town you sail over lumps and bumps in the road, and on the motorway you feel like you’re wafting on a cloud. Visibility out the back isn’t great, but there isn’t much wind or road noise, and adaptive cruise control (standard on the range-topping model) helps to make long-distance journeys even less taxing. It’s even pretty fun on a twisty back road, which is surprising given the car’s spongy, souffle-like suspension set-up. There’s a bit of roll through corners , but this movement feels very controlled, and the lightweight steering is accurate enough. So if you can get onboard with the slightly marmite styling and quirky convention-busting is-it-an-SUv-or-estate-ness, there’s a huge amount to like about the Citroen C5 X. It’s super comfortable, impressively spacious and usefully practical. To find out how much you could save when buying through Carwow, check out the latest Citroen C5 X deals. You can also browse used Citroen C5 X models as well as other used Citroen cars. If you want to sell your car online , Carwow can help with that, too. How much is the Citroen C5 X? How much is the Citroen C5 X? Both the list price and the monthly finance payments on the C5 X make it seem like remarkably good value, being comparable to smaller and far less interesting rivals. Despite a lower list price, it’s still well equipped. Even the entry-level Sense Plus model has 19in alloy wheels, LED headlights , and a 10.0in touchscreen with sat nav, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto as standard. You’ll also get front and rear parking sensors, and a reversing camera. The mid-level Shine model gets upgraded leather upholstery inside and some fancy chrome trim elements around the exterior. You also get a heated steering wheel, a larger 12.0-inch touchscreen infotainment system, a head-up display and a wireless chargepad for your smartphone. The range-topping Shine Plus model gets special leather seats with a unique upholstery design, as well as a full 360-degree parking camera. The front seats are electrically operated and heated too, while you also get a powered tailgate to help make loading and unloading a bit easier. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort The C5 X soft suspension means it majors on comfort and rolling refinement. Its petrol and hybrid powertrains aren’t perfect, however Large cars are never ideal in town, but the C5 X makes up for its size with comfort. With its super soft suspension set-up, the big Citroen is generally a supremely comfortable car in urban environments for the driver and passengers. The C5 X deals with lumpy stretches of road really nicely, with a souffle-like squish to its body movements. More sudden ruts and bumps can send a bit of a jolt through the cabin, however, so it doesn’t have a classic Citroen’s miraculous ability to make speed bumps seemingly disappear. It is certainly a good deal more comfortable than a stiffly-sprung sports saloon from one of the prestige German brands though. The Citroen’s steering is extremely light too, which can feel a little odd at first. But once you’re used to it, you’ll find it makes navigating the C5 X around tight corners an easy process and driving more relaxing. Rear visibility isn’t the best thanks to the car’s fat rear pillars, but the standard-fit front and rear parking sensors, as well as a reversing camera, help out here. Out on the motorway the C5 X really settles down nicely to give an extremely comfortable drive. Very little wind or road noise is allowed to make its way into the cabin at 70mph and the tyre noise is well damped, even on rougher concrete sections of road. The engines might seem to be remarkably small for a car of this size (1.2- and 1.6-litre), but they purr away very quietly. Turbos and, in the case of the PHEV, an electric motor, assist to boost the power on uphill stretches and slip roads, so even the 131bhp model feels adequate. Adaptive cruise control (standard fit on range-topping Shine Plus models) makes life easier on long journeys too. All you need to do is select your preferred speed and the car will automatically maintain a set distance between you and whatever vehicle is travelling in front of you. Given its soft, spongy suspension setup you might be surprised to find that the C5 X is actually pretty fun on a twisty road. It’s by no means as sporty-feeling as, say, a BMW 5 Series or even a Cupra Formentor; but it controls its roll nicely through corners and grips well. The lightweight steering is completely devoid of feel, but you get used to it eventually. The plug-in hybrid model gets fancy adaptive dampers that let you soften or firm up the car’s suspension and throttle response as you see fit, too. It’s very good, but not good enough that you’ll find yourself justifying the extra cost of the hybrid just to get it. The normal setup works just fine. Space and practicality Space and practicality There’s plenty of room in the C5 X’s cabin for all passengers to get comfy, but its boot isn’t quite as large as some more conventional SUVs or estate cars The C5 X comes fitted with Citroen’s ‘Advanced Comfort Seats’ as standard. These are essentially just large, generously cushioned chairs that feel more like your favourite armchair than a regular car seat, and use layers of different foams to give better support. Over distance they’re extremely comfortable and supportive, and despite their bulky shape and size they don’t eat into valuable cabin space – you’ll still have plenty of room to play with up front. There’s loads of driving position adjustability too, so it’s easy to get comfortable behind the wheel. The entry-level Sense Plus and Shine models have manually-adjustable front seats, while the range-topper gets electrically-operated, heated chairs as standard. Massage and ventilation functions are available optionally to help keep you even comfier when you’re behind the wheel. Once you are comfortable, you’ll not be left wanting for storage cubbies either. The glovebox is a good size, and there’s a reasonably large compartment nestled away in the centre console too. A wireless charge pad sits just below the controls for the air conditioning and is large enough to hold some of the bigger smartphones you can get these days. The front cupholders are deep enough to take a medium-sized flask or bottle without it falling over while you’re on the move, and the door bins up-front are spacious too. If you’re sitting in the second row, you won’t feel short-changed on the comfort front either. Besides having the same supportive seats, there’s a huge amount of legroom available, so you can stretch out easily. And headspace is pretty good too. Only the tallest adult passengers will likely find the tops of their heads come into close contact with the roof lining. The centre seat is obviously not going to be as comfortable as the outer pair, but is still a decent size and wont draw too many complaints from smaller passengers, even on a longer journey. There are ISOFIX points for the two outer seats. Rear seat occupants get decent practicality too, with cupholders in the fold-down centre armrest, pouches on the backs of the front seats for things like books, maps, iPads and sweet wrappers, and decent size doorbins. The regular petrol-engined versions of the Citroen C5 X come with a large, estate car-style 545-litre boot that’ll easily swallow a couple of large suitcases without too much fuss or bother. Citroen has even demonstrated that it would take a washing machine without having to fold the seats – handy if you need to do a tip trip. Based on the figures alone, the C5 X compares well to alternatives such as the Cupra Formentor, but lags behind conventional SUVs such as the Volkswagen Tiguan or full-fat estates such as the Skoda Superb by a fair margin. Still, the opening is wide and there’s no load lip to speak of, so hauling heavier items in and out of the C5 X will be an easy task. There’s through-loading for longer items, and you can of course fold the rear seats down to open up even more storage space. That said, it’s worth mentioning that the plug-in hybrid model has a considerably smaller boot. With the need to house a big battery, outright space drops to 485 litres with the rear seats in place. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories The stylish interior design is nowhere near as divisive as the exterior, but the infotainment system could be a bit sharper Where the C5 X’s exterior will possibly lose it as many fans as it wins, the design of its interior is much more universally appealing. A choice selection of materials includes everything from wood-effect trim inserts and soft-touch plastics to plush-feeling leather and fabric upholsteries depending on which model you opt for. A large infotainment system and a digital instrument display help to make the C5 X look impressively high-tech, too. Thankfully, however, Citroen has resisted the urge to incorporate the controls for the air conditioning into the touchscreen itself. So you still get good, old-fashioned dials and buttons below the central screen – all of which help to make it far easier to adjust the temperature while you’re driving. In the entry-level Sense Plus model, you’re greeted by a distinctly monotone colour theme that Citroen calls ‘Urban Grey’. This includes grey fabric and leather upholstery for the seats, and similarly coloured trim inserts for the doors and dash. While that might all sound a bit dull and boring, the end result is actually pretty swish. Move into the mid-range Shine model and that fabric seat upholstery is swapped out for leather, and the dash and door inserts are a deeper shade of grey. It makes the cabin look and feel considerably darker, but not in a bad way. The range-topping Shine Plus car adds the lighter-coloured wood-effect dash trim, and some trendy leather seats with a perforated Citroen chevron design worked in. But regardless of the model you opt for, when you drop down into its large, comfortable seats, you likely feel as though you’ve just sat down in the living room of some trendy, modernist house – complete with the latest in tech. There are two different infotainment systems available. The entry-level Sense Plus model gets a 10.0-inch set-up that includes features such as satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, Bluetooth and DAB radio. Even at this most basic level it’s a well-equipped system. The pricier Shine and Shine Plus models swap the 10.0-inch screen out for a larger 12.0-inch unit, and you’ll also gain a head-up display to go along with the digital instrument binnacle that’s fitted as standard to all C5 X models. Superficially, the infotainment software looks sharp enough. Mapping information is clearly displayed, and it doesn’t take too long to figure out how everything works. That said, when you begin to interact with the screen, it can be a bit slow and laggy in its response times – and certain menus and home screens can look a shade cluttered. Although, given that Android Auto and Apple CarPlay are both included as standard, you’ll likely find that you’ll just default to using them instead of Citroen’s own set-up. MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax You get a choice of three different engines with the new C5 X. The most affordable option is a 1.2-litre petrol engine, which develops a modest 130hp. Next comes the larger 1.6-litre petrol that churns out 180hp. Then, at the top of the range sits the 225hp plug-in hybrid. This adds an electric motor and a 12kWh battery into the mix, which allows for an official electric-only range of up to 34 miles. All of these engines drive the front wheels through an eight-speed automatic transmission – there’s no option of a manual here. For most private buyers, the two regular petrol engines will do the trick. The 180bhp engine is generally pretty smooth and quiet when you’re up and running, and we saw an economy figure of about 37mpg – which isn’t too bad. At low speeds the eight-speed gearbox can feel a bit lumpy and will occasionally give you a soft kick in the back as it swaps gears. Try and bring the car to a gentle standstill, and you’ll find the stop-start system that automatically cuts the engine to reduce emissions to be a bit overly keen too. This results in you lurching to a halt at times, which is a bit undignifying. The plug-in hybrid model has a bit more punch when you put your foot down, thanks to the instant surge provided by its electric motor. It’s obviously also extremely good at silently wafting around town when you’re running on electric power alone. Citroen says you should be able to get up to 34 miles of range from the battery, but we saw somewhere around 20 on our test route. Given the hybrid’s higher price, you’ll probably only want to go for this model if you’re going to be running it as a company car, as you’ll be able to make the most of its far lower tax rating, although the 12% benefit-in-kind rate is not the most competitive. You’ll want to make sure you have access to a home charger too – otherwise you won’t benefit from the lower running costs that plug-in hybrids can bring. Speaking of charge times, it’ll take you just over 1.5 hours to top the battery up when plugged into a 7kW home wallbox . Use a regular household socket, and that time increases to 5.5 hours. Safety and security Safety and security The independent testers from the Euro NCAP organisation have not yet tested a Citroen C5 X, but they did put a similar (but more SUV-shaped) C5 Aircross through the trials and it came out with a full five star rating. The C5 X uses the same basic structure and technology, so it’s fair to assume that it too will be a safe car. There is a full suite of crash prevention tech which works well and could stop you needing the airbags and pop-up pedestrian protection active bonnet. You’ll also get front and rear parking sensors, and a reversing camera on all models. The range-topping Shine Plus model also gets upgraded to a full 360-degree parking camera to prevent knocks. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems The C5 X is too new to be featured in any reliability surveys just yet, but other Citroen models which use the same powertrains have done surprisingly well in owners’ polls. If anything should go wrong, Citroen offers a three-year warranty, made up of two years with unlimited mileage and a third year that brings in a mileage limit, so you are only covered up to 60,000 miles. This level of cover is the bare minimum in the market these days and is soundly beaten by brands such as Kia , Renault and Toyota ."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/citroen/c3,Citroen C3 Review & Prices,"€23,470",8/10,new,"Is the Citroen C3 a good car? Is the Citroen C3 a good car? The Citroen C3 has been totally reinvented, and this is it - Citroen’s new budget competitor taking aim at some of the cheapest cars on sale today. Despite this, it’s one of the best small cars you can buy. It’s available in all-electric form as the brilliant e-C3 , but this review focuses on the petrol and hybrid models, simply known as C3. Confusingly, the old C3 remains on sale for a while - it’s been renamed C3 Origin . This all-new model is built on a cheap set of components originally designed for developing countries. But with clever design, and by loading it with generous standard equipment, Citroen’s managed to make the C3 feel rather more than the sum of its parts. It’s like creatively decorating using exclusively IKEA furniture - the components might be cheap, but with some smart touches you can have a really effective result. If you’re looking at the C3, chances are you’re considering other low-priced alternatives such as the Dacia Sandero , the Kia Picanto or even the outgoing Citroen C3 Origin. The new C3 has a boxy body and rides high - like a compact SUV . This means it has plenty of interior space - two adults can sit comfortably in the rear, and the 310-litre boot is a very respectable size, comparing favourably with some hatchbacks costing much more. The dashboard is also largely a triumph. Citroen’s managed to mask its use of inexpensive, scratchy materials with a fabric strip running across the middle that not only looks cool but brightens up what would otherwise be a sea of black. The 10.3-inch infotainment screen may not be the most high-definition, or run the very latest software, but it does just about everything you’d reasonably want - and it’s bang up-to-date with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity allowing you to circumvent Citroen’s own interface if you so choose. Comfortable seats, great visibility and a very clear digital screen for driver information are all great additions too. The C3 is powered by one of two engines. At the entry level, there’s a 1.2-litre petrol engine which gets a five-speed manual gearbox - good for an easy 50mpg fuel economy. Performance is relatively modest with just 100hp on tap, but it’s much quicker than most cars of this price. Later on in the C3’s life Citroen will launch a hybrid model . This also has 100hp, but gets an automatic transmission and should return even more impressive economy. If this sounds like the budget model for you, then check out our best deals on the Citroen C3 - or find a great deal on another Citroen model . You can also browse our used Citroens for sale , and remember that when the time comes you can even sell your car right here on Carwow through our network of trusted dealers. How much is the Citroen C3? How much is the Citroen C3? The electric e-C3 may be the car stealing the headlines with its starting price, but don’t let that detract from the regular C3’s value proposition. With a starting price of less than £18,000, it’s only a couple of thousand pounds more than you’d pay for most city cars - which tend to have barely two-thirds of the power, much less space, far less standard equipment and nowhere near as much charm. The exception to this would be Dacia, which offers a well-equipped and good-to-drive Sandero for less than the C3, though it’s not exactly brimming with personality. The C3’s kit list is also significantly more modern than any current Dacia. The infotainment screen feels up-to-date, and features niceties like wireless smartphone mirroring. All models come with a full raft of safety equipment, and if you step up to the Max trim the C3 comes with big-car features like a wireless charging pad, tinted windows, and heated seats, steering wheel and windscreen. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort Light and easy to drive, though not very fast or very fun In town The C3 feels like it was made for the city. You sit up much higher than in most cheap cars, for a start, and visibility out of the upright windscreen and large windows is pretty good all-round with just a small blind spot over your shoulder. The 99hp petrol engine feels peppy at town speeds, but the five-speed manual gearbox does feel a little bit loose and baggy - a Dacia Sandero has a more precise shift. It’s the only gearbox on offer, at least until the C3 Hybrid arrives with its six-speed automatic. The C3’s steering is super-light and makes short work of nipping into tight spaces or parking. It’s easy to judge the car’s extremities, too, as it’s pretty much a box. You even get rear parking sensors as standard, or a reversing camera on the higher trim level. The best part, though, is the C3’s suspension, which has some clever hydraulic components built into it. It’s so forgiving that it easily soaks up any lumps, potholes or other road imperfections. It copes brilliantly with speed bumps, too. On the motorway The C3’s suspension makes it a very relaxing companion on the motorway - it deals with poorly surfaced roads better than many cars two or even three times the price. Getting it up to speed isn’t quite so serene, but with 100hp on tap the C3 is significantly more powerful than most entry-level cars of a similar price - think of the 75hp you get in a base Volkswagen Polo, or the 70hp of a Fiat 500 hybrid . This means it’s quicker to accelerate than those cars, and you have much more in reserve at the national speed limit. The soft suspension, light weight and slab sides do mean that the C3 feels a little susceptible to cross winds and buffeting from larger vehicles, and the light steering means it can also feel a little twitchy. Both are perfectly acceptable compromises in a car this cheap. On a twisty road The C3’s light steering is pretty accurate and it grips surprisingly well in corners. However, the body leans a lot in the bends and there isn’t a lot of feedback about what the front wheels are doing - so you’d struggle to say it was much fun. If you’re looking for a small car that’s really engaging to drive, you’ll need something like a Suzuki Swift or a basic Mini - otherwise, the C3 is well up to the standards of other cheap cars. Space and practicality Space and practicality Lots of space - and not much else The Citroen C3 is pretty big for a cheap car, and if you’re comparing it to something like a Kia Picanto or Toyota Aygo X you’ll find it positively palatial. The front seats are wide, comfortable and have enough adjustment for drivers of all sizes - though don’t expect anything beyond the usual fore/aft, backrest and height adjustment. Storage in the front is pretty good, with two big cupholders and a phone shelf in the centre (with a wireless charging pad on higher trim levels), big door bins and a reasonable glovebox. Plus models don’t come with a centre armrest, but Max cars do and there’s a little extra storage under here. You can also leave things on the wide, fabric-covered shelf of the dash, though they won’t stay there under hard cornering. Space in the back seats Space for rear passengers is pretty good, especially next to the much smaller cars you’d be comparing the C3 against price-wise. The extra height of the C3’s boxy body means passengers can sit more upright, giving them more legroom, and so you can pretty easily squeeze four six-foot adults inside. The central seat is really narrow, though, so you probably won’t fit three people abreast unless they’re all very skinny. The rear doors open nice and wide, and there are ISOFIX child seat mounts in the two outer rear seats. There are small door bins for rear passengers and, in models without a central armrest, access to the storage bin - but no cupholders or armrest. Boot space The C3’s 310-litre boot compares very favourably to most cars of a similar price - take the Toyota Aygo X (231 litres), Dacia Sandero (328 litres) or Hyundai i10 (252 litres). It’s a deep rather than long space, with a substantial lip to hoof items over - and the rear seatbacks don’t leave a completely flat floor when you fold them down. Don’t go expecting any clever storage solutions in the boot, either - there’s no false floor, the trim feels rather unfinished, and there’s only one hook for a shopping bag. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories Some corner-cutting evident, but the C3 feels really good inside for such a cheap car The C3 has an attractively designed interior, which makes a nice change when talking about a budget car - some of this model’s alternatives really feel as though they only have a dashboard so that there’s something to hold the speedometer in place. Material quality is uniformly inexpensive and feels it in places, especially lower down on the dashboard. However, most of what you touch feels like it’s been quite well screwed-together, and a swathe of fabric trim across the middle of the dashboard brightens up what would otherwise be a sea of black plastic. The dash is dominated by a 10.3-inch touchscreen which features as standard equipment on both C3 trim levels. It’s the same size as the one that features on some of Citroen’s other cars, but has a less complex interface with fewer features - not necessarily a bad thing, as it feels simpler to use. Some functions are a little awkward, but the good news is that the C3 comes as standard with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto so you can bypass Citroen’s own interface if you prefer. This also provides you with navigation, which isn’t standard otherwise. You get a discrete gauge cluster, which takes the form of a digital screen right at the top of the dashboard. It’s easy to read, but doesn’t have much in the way of functionality - you can’t get it to show data beyond basic trip computer functions, for example, where a Volkswagen Polo’s digital dashboard can display a full-screen map if you so desire. MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax The C3’s 1.2-litre petrol engine doesn’t have any official fuel economy figures yet, but based on our fairly lengthy test drive we’d say that 50mpg is easy to achieve, with 55mpg possible if you have a light right foot. CO2 emissions are a relatively unimpressive 128g/km, though, so the C3 doesn’t make the most cost-effective company car. The forthcoming C3 Hybrid should have improved fuel efficiency courtesy of its electric motor, plus reduced emissions. We’ll update this review once official figures become available, and of course once we’ve had the chance to confirm them for ourselves. Safety and security Safety and security The new Citroen C3 hasn’t been crash tested by Euro NCAP yet. The Indian-market model has been tested and scored very poorly, but for Europe Citroen has made some significant changes under the skin and to available safety equipment so we’d expect a better performance for the model you’ll be able to buy - if not necessarily the full five stars. All C3s do get the full roster of EU-mandated safety equipment, but the early-build test car we drove had all of them disabled so we can’t report on their effectiveness. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems Citroen’s historic reputation for unreliable cars is quickly being quashed, with impressive performances for several models in the Driver Power owner satisfaction survey including outright victory for the C4 in 2023. The C3’s platform may be new to Europe but has been out in other markets for some time, and being designed for developing areas of the world means a certain degree of ruggedness and repairability. The C3 is covered by Citroen’s standard three-year, 60,000-mile warranty - unlimited in the first two years."

The Citroen C4 looks like nothing else on the road, and depending on your taste that may be a great starting point. It’s the size of regular family hatchbacks such as the Volkswagen Golf and Kia Ceed , but it has chunky styling and a slightly raised body - so you may instead be shortlisting it alongside compact SUVs such as the Ford Puma , Peugeot 2008 or Volkswagen T-Cross . It’s a bit like a British Indian takeaway - perfectly comfortable being a fusion of two things. It’s not authentically a hatchback or an SUV, but unless you’re really into labels, does it really matter? And like those takeaways, it can be great value, with a starting price that comfortably undercuts many key alternatives. The C4 was launched in 2020, and its mid-life facelift went on sale in early 2025. The most obvious change was to the styling - Citroen rebranded itself during the pre-facelift model’s life, and so the latest cars wear the newest Citroen roundel at the front. They also get new slim LED headlights with multiple daytime running light stripes, while around the back there are squarer LED taillights and the Citroen wordmark spelled out across the boot lid. Inside, it’s pretty much business as it was before - but there are new seats with better support in the corners, an updated infotainment system and a new digital gauge cluster to replace the old car’s fairly basic one. In practicality terms, the Citroen C4 is closer to a hatchback than an SUV. Though it’s slightly taller than something like a Volkswagen Golf, that doesn’t really equate to increased interior space, and legroom in the back is only just about okay for adults. The C4’s 380-litre boot is a decent size, matching the Golf, but much smaller than a Ford Puma or Peugeot 2008 - you can blame the stylish, swoopy roof line for that. The interior does feel built down to a price, but considering the C4 costs nearly £5,000 less than the equivalent Volkswagen Golf you can forgive a few areas of scratchy plastic. What’s more important is that it’s easy to use, and here it’s a mixed bag. Technophobes will love that Citroen’s retained a full set of physical climate controls underneath the main screen, as well as physical buttons for things like the drive modes and on the steering wheel. You even get an easy shortcut to turn off the more annoying driver assistance features. However, the infotainment screen isn’t quite so straightforward. There are quite a lot of menus to dive through, and functions aren’t always where you’d expect them to be. The C4 comes with a choice of petrol or hybrid engines - there’s also an all-electric e-C4 , which we’ll cover separately. All offer good fuel economy and plenty of performance, considering the C4 is quite a lightweight car. But the hybrid engines are much noisier than the ones in a Toyota Yaris Cross , and the sole petrol offering comes paired to a pretty clunky eight-speed automatic gearbox. To drive, it’s quite interesting - because so few cheap cars focus on comfort any more, instead fitting stiff suspension and big wheels to improve looks and handling. The result is that the C4 feels wallowy and awkward if you’re trying to sling it down a back road, but on the flip side it’s superbly comfortable on the motorway and deals with lumps,, potholes and speed bumps around town better than anything else this side of a luxury car. There’s no denying the C4 won’t suit everybody, then, but if it sounds like your cup of tea why not check out our best Citroen C4 deals here? You can find a used Citroen C4 for sale here, or check out other used Citroens for sale here. And remember that Carwow is the place to be if you need to sell your old car , where our network of trusted dealers will bid to get you the best price. How much is the Citroën C4? How much is the Citroën C4? Prices for the C4 kick off at less than £23,000 - that’s much less than any comparably sized hatchback, and Citroen often offers impressive discounts to make it even more reasonable. The range starts with the You! model which comes pretty generously equipped. LED headlights, a 10.0-inch touchscreen and 5.0-inch instrument cluster, climate control, rear parking sensors and 18-inch alloy wheels all come as standard equipment, though stepping up to the Plus model does net you a larger 7.0-inch instrument cluster, head-up display, reversing camera and navigation along with a more powerful set of engines to choose from. The range-topping Max, meanwhile, still comfortably undercuts a Volkswagen Golf but gets a heated steering wheel and front seats, adaptive cruise control, tinted rear windows, blind-spot detection and keyless entry. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort The C4 doesn't like being pushed down a country road but it's superly comfy over bumps in town Citroen doesn’t pretend that the C4 is even one bit sporty - instead, it’s focused completely on comfort. Key to this is what Citroen calls ‘Progressive Hydraulic Cushion’ suspension - essentially, hydraulic elements in the dampers which make for seriously soft suspension but without allowing the car to wallow all over the place. It works fantastically well around town. Though it doesn’t iron out speed bumps like the biggest luxury cars, it takes the sharp edges off them. It also successfully masks poor road surfaces - and combined with the very soft and forgiving seats, makes for a relaxing experience. All versions of the C4 are now automatic, but it’s the hybrid engines that are the best to drive around town as they use the electric motor to mask the slightly choppy gear changes. Visibility out of the front is good, but the rear window is split across two parts and has a line across the middle of it - and no wiper - so rearward visibility isn’t fantastic. The C4 has a good turning circle, but even the biggest alloy wheels have a lot of tyre sidewall so you won’t be perpetually worrying about bumping into kerbs. The trick suspension does work very well on the motorway, too. The C4 really glides across bad road surfaces when you’re going quickly, with only short sharp impacts - like expansion joints on bridges - penetrating the cabin’s ambiance. The engines can all get a bit raucous on the motorway - the three-cylinder thrum isn’t unpleasant, but it’s a touch louder than you’d like especially when you’re trying to get up to speed on a slip road. Wind and road noise is otherwise well contained. Citroen’s assisted driving features work quite well, with adaptive cruise control and lane-keeping aids that don’t feel too obtrusive or twitchy. Get onto a winding country lane and you can see where Citroen’s comfort focus means compromise. If you try and push on you’ll soon notice that the C4 leans a lot more in corners than a comparable hatchback or small SUV - something like a Ford Puma feels much more tight and natural to drive quickly. The C4’s steering is also super-light, which is great around town but does leave you rather unsure of where the front wheels are pointing. Grip in the corners is just fine, but it’s just no fun driving the C4 fast - it’s much more satisfying to go a bit slower and take advantage of the suspension soaking up the lumps and bumps of a typical B-road. Space and practicality Space and practicality The latest C4 offers plenty if interior storage and the seats are super comfy, but it's only average in terms of boot space The C4 isn’t a huge car, but other small SUVs have boxier bodies and therefore have more room for passengers and people - take a look at the Volkswagen T-Cross or Dacia Duster if you want to see a compact SUV that makes the most of its interior space. Up front, the C4’s seats deserve special mention - they’re so-called ‘Advanced Comfort’ affairs, which is a fancy way of saying that while they look flat, different types of foam padding provide a really nice amount of support. They’re accommodating for drivers of all sizes, and after the 2025 facelift they even support you quite well in the corners - something the earlier C4’s seats didn’t do. Storage is quite good - there’s a pair of big, deep cupholders, a shelf for your phone (with a wireless charger on some models) and a usefully grippy tray with a hidden storage compartment underneath it. It’s just a shame that bigger items can’t go in the glovebox - on right-hand drive examples in the UK, most of the space is taken up by the fuse box. You get a shallow drawer instead, but this is taken up by a clever mount for a tablet. Two six-foot adults won’t struggle too much for legroom or foot space, but the C4 isn’t really wide enough to carry three abreast in comfort, and the sloping roofline means headroom is at a bit of a premium. Again, more boxy cars - or ones where you sit lower, like a Volkswagen Golf - offer greater practicality in the rear. You get ISOFIX mounting points in the outer rear seats, and the rear doors open quite wide, but you will have to manoeuvre taller child seats underneath that sloping roof. There’s not much to report back here - boot space in the Citroen C4 isn’t particularly stellar. At 380 litres it matches the Volkswagen Golf, but the vast majority of small SUVs make it look puny - the Peugeot 2008 has 434 litres, the Ford Puma 456 litres, while the Dacia Duster has up to 517 litres. There’s an adjustable boot floor so you can either maximise space or have a totally flat floor when the seats are folded down - a useful touch. Otherwise, the steeply-raked back window does limit your capacity to carry large, square items, so be careful if you’re thinking about taking an old washing machine to the tip or visiting everybody’s favourite Swedish flat-pack furniture store. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories The C4’s interior isn’t particularly stylish, but considering the price of the car it does actually feel reasonably premium and quite well-made. There are of course some cheaper materials if you go looking for them - the door cards feel quite flimsy, as does the lower part of the centre console, and there’s quite a lot of shiny piano black plastic which is going to instantly be marred by greasy fingerprints. The tech on offer is the same as you get in many much more expensive products from the Stellantis family, though. The C4 has a 10.0-inch touchscreen infotainment system as standard, which sits nice and high up on the dashboard so it’s right in your eyeline. Wireless smartphone connectivity comes as standard which is great, because nobody likes having wires trailing all around the cabin. You do have to step up a trim level or two before you get the corresponding wireless smartphone charger, though. The rest of the interface does leave a little to be desired. The screen is bright and clear but isn't always the quickest to respond, and some functions are buried in places you wouldn’t expect them to be - or if they are, you have to navigate through a few too many menus to get there. The Kia Stonic or Ceed have much more straightforward systems. You can of course use voice commands, which on the C4 are connected to ChatGPT to give AI functionality. Take its advice with a pinch of salt, though - it proudly told us there were two ‘Bs’ in the word ‘strawberry’. Once nice feature is that Citroen hasn’t seen fit to route all of the C4’s controls through the touchscreen. You get a full panel of climate controls, as well as switches for all the functions you’re likely to need to adjust while driving. There’s even a panel to adjust the height of the head-up display, which is usually something buried under many layers of menus in alternatives. MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax The C4 is offered with two hybrid engines and one non-hybrid petrol option. There are also a pair of electric variants, which we’ll cover separately in our Citroen e-C4 review. The entry-level trim gets the lower-powered 100hp hybrid, while Plus and Max trims can choose between a 136hp hybrid or a 130hp plain petrol. Fuel economy from the hybrid 136 was very good indeed, returning 57mpg on a mixed test route. We’d expect similar results from the 100hp hybrid, perhaps dipping a little if you find yourself needing to put your foot down more to get up to speed. That’s a really good figure compared to a Ford Puma or MG ZS, but it’s worth noting that the Toyota Yaris Cross can achieve well over 60mpg with consummate ease - it’s the running cost champion. The 130hp petrol, meanwhile, should return 50mpg on a long cruise, but less than 40mpg around town, if our experience with it in the pre-facelift car is anything to go by. It’s a shame Citroen no longer offers the super-economical 1.5-litre diesel, but low sales mean there was no reason for it to continue. CO2 emissions from the hybrids are less than 110g/km, bringing with them fairly low rates of road tax as well as company car BIK tax - but plug-in hybrid or fully-electric alternatives make much more sense thanks to the huge cost-savings available. Safety and security Safety and security The latest C4 has a four-star Euro NCAP safety rating. It performs well in a collision but was deducted points for pedestrian safety and a limited suite of active safety features. Active safety features fitted as standard include Traffic Sign and Speed Limit recognition, Lane Departure Warning and Cruise Control with Speed Limiter function. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems Every new Citroën comes with a three-year/60,000 mile, fully transferable warranty and a 12-year anti-perforation warranty. Citroen also provides a new eight-year warranty on all the powertrain components - that is, the engine, gearbox and their related items. Citroen was the fifth most reliable car brand in the 2024 Driver Power owner satisfaction survey , which goes to show that stereotypes about French cars being flimsy might be displaced. The pre-facelift C4 actually came top of the 2023 survey, which is a stellar performance. Citroen C4 FAQs Citroen C4 FAQs"
https://www.carwow.co.uk/citroen/berlingo,Citroen Berlingo Review & Prices,"€29,975",6/10,new,"Is the Citroen Berlingo a good car? Is the Citroen Berlingo a good car? The humble van-based MPV is something of a dying breed these days, with a lot of buyers moving towards SUVs instead. The Citroen Berlingo is here to fly the flag for the boxy people carrier, offering a massive boot and loads of cubby spaces inside. You can think of the Berlingo as being like a pair of cargo trousers. It’s functional, comfortable and practical, if not the most on-trend option on the market. There’s no hiding the fact that the Berlingo is based on a van, but Citroen has made a few changes to spice things up for this passenger version. You have a different bumper with split-level headlights and range-topping models get smart-looking alloy wheels. This car is pretty much identical to the Peugeot Rifter and Vauxhall Combo Life under the skin, but the Citroen is arguably the most distinctive. The Berlingo’s commercial vehicle roots are also apparent on the inside, where there’s not much in the way of plush materials. Go for the entry-level Feel model and you’re greeted by a swathe of hard black plastic across the dashboard, although the Flair XTR does add a pop of colour to the otherwise bland cabin. All models get an 8.0-inch touchscreen as standard, which helps to keep things looking modern. There’s plenty of space up front, and you get loads of adjustment in the seat to make yourself comfortable behind the wheel. What’s surprising for a car like this is the rear legroom, because there’s not that much of it. The back seats are also quite upright, so they’re not the most comfortable on long journeys. What’s not lacking in the back is headroom thanks to that boxy body, and there’s more than enough shoulder space to fit three across the back as well. The main reason you’ll buy this over something like a Citroen C5 Aircross or Kia Sportage is the boot, because it’s gigantic. You get a whopping 1,255 litres of space back there. That’s a huge increase on the 580 litres you get in the C5 Aircross. You have three engine options to choose from. If It’s petrol power you’re after, there’s a 110hp option with a six-speed manual gearbox. There are also two diesel options, one with 101hp and a six-speed manual, or a 130hp engine with an eight-speed automatic. No matter which engine you go for, the Berlingo is pretty easy to drive. The tall driving position and vast windscreen give you a great view out, and the big, van-like door mirrors make it easy to see behind you as well.

How much is the Citroen Berlingo? How much is the Citroen Berlingo? When it comes to space for the money, the Citroen Berlingo is hard to beat. The range-topping car costs about the same as an entry-level Kia Sportage, but it’s a lot more practical than that car. The only slight fly in the Berlingo’s ointment is the Vauxhall Combo Life, because that car is almost identical under the skin but will set you back a fair bit less. The Citroen is a more funky-looking thing though. Choosing which Berlingo is right for you is easy, because there are just two of them: Feel and Flair XTR. Entry-level models feel a bit basic, with a plastic steering wheel and plastic wheel trims, but you do still get an 8.0-inch touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto , as well as lane keeping assist and cruise control . Go for the Flair XTR model and you get some snazzy 17-inch alloy wheels, a leather steering wheel, dual-zone climate control, power-folding door mirrors and a reversing camera. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort The Citroen Berlingo is a doddle to drive, despite its size and it’s pretty comfortable as well. It’s just not as refined as an SUV at motorway speeds, and there’s no fun to be had The Citroen Berlingo may be a big car, but it’s really easy to drive in town thanks to a commanding driving position and the vast glass area. It’s a bit like driving a greenhouse, with massive windows all around giving you an almost 360-degree view from the driver’s seat. That said, tight car parks will be made a lot easier by the reversing camera. This comes as standard on the range-topping car, but it’s an optional extra on the Feel model. The steering is really light at low speeds, and the Berlingo has a decent turning circle as well so navigating around town is a stress-free affair. The raised suspension also means it’s nice and soft over bumps in the road, although particularly large potholes can send a thud through the cabin. If you want an automatic to take the stress out of slow-moving traffic, you’ll have to go for the 130hp 1.5-litre diesel engine. While this option is plenty powerful enough, and it’s economical, it’s quite noisy even at low speeds. The eight-speed automatic gearbox is also sluggish to react when you want to pull out at junctions. If you don’t mind going for a manual, the 110hp 1.2-litre petrol is a better bet for town driving. It’s still a bit thrummy, but it’s a lot quieter than the diesel while also offering decent fuel economy and nippy performance. Driving the Berlingo on the motorway is a mixed bag. On the positive side, it’s pretty comfortable thanks to the pliant suspension and squidgy seats. The large door mirrors and great visibility also make it easy to keep an eye on what’s going on around you. However, you do get quite a lot of road noise echoing around the cabin, and the brick-like shape of the car generates a fair amount of wind noise as well. Go for one of the diesel models and you’ll add a healthy amount of drone from the engine. If it’s refinement you’re after, something like a Ford Tourneo Connect is a better option. You do get cruise control as standard across the range, but there’s no adaptive system on offer here. Active lane keep assist is also standard to keep you between the lines, as well as speed and traffic sign recognition. The van-like driving position of the Citroen Berlingo has its perks on a country road, giving you a great view of the road ahead. The boxy dimensions also make it easy to position in your lane, and it’s comfortable over all the usual lumps and bumps in a British B road. For those keen drivers out there, there’s no fun to be had behind the wheel. That’s to be expected in a car like this, but if you’re after a practical family car with a sporty edge then the Ford Kuga is worth a look. The steering is accurate enough though, and the car will go where you point it. The Berlingo is much better suited to a calm and sedate driving style though, as you’ll feel the body roll if you go into a bend too quickly. Space and practicality Space and practicality Practicality is the main reason you’ll buy the Berlingo over an SUV thanks to a cavernous boot. It’s just a shame that rear legroom is surprisingly tight The Berlingo’s van-based origins make it a very spacious car up front. You get plenty of adjustment in the seat to get comfortable behind the wheel, and there’s acres of headroom. Some people may find the seats lack support though because they’re quite flat, so make sure they’re comfortable enough for you before parting with your cash. It’s easy to empty all your pockets before setting off as well, because there are a lot of cubby holes dotted around the cabin. You get a compartment above the dials and another one on the passenger side, an open storage bin below that and two large trays above your head. The door bins are also massive, and there’s a total of four cupholders in the front. There’s just one USB port for charging your phone, and it’s on the front of the infotainment screen. Handily, you get another tray behind the screen to hide your phone away. There is an old-school 12V socket lower down as well if you need to charge more devices. The Berlingo’s boxy shape means you get plenty of headroom in the back, and there’s more than enough shoulder space to get three people across the rear bench. Despite this, the back seats aren’t the most comfortable. The Berlingo gets a metal cage separating the boot from the passenger compartment, and it pushes the rear seat backs forward making them bolt upright. There’s not that much legroom for a car of this size either, so long trips in the back could be tricky. If you’re carrying two adults in the back on a regular basis, a Citroen C5 Aircross is more comfortable. You don’t get much in the way of storage space in the back seats. The sliding rear doors mean you only have very small door bins, and there are a couple of pouches on the back of the front seats. Those in the back get use of a couple of picnic tables as well, and they have cup holders built in. Those sliding doors have their benefits when it comes to accessing the rear seats. Getting kids in and out in tight car parks is a doddle, and fitting a child seat is a painless affair as well. You get three ISOFIX points in the back and, because the Berlingo is so wide, you can easily get three child seats in. Thankfully, the Berlingo makes up for its lack of rear legroom with a cavernous boot. You get a whopping 1,255 litres of space, and that full-height cage means you can load it up to the roof without the risk of things flying into the cabin. The drawback of the cage is that it stops you from being able to utilise the whole cabin for carrying really large items. The back seats do still fold down, as does the front passenger seat, but that bulkhead is an immovable obstacle in the way of ultimate usability. If you go for the all-electric E-Berlingo , that car doesn't have the cage so you can fold all the seats down and use it like a van. You get an adjustable parcel shelf which you can place in the middle of the boot, handy for separating your cargo, however it’s so massive that there’s nowhere to store it if you want to remove it entirely. The load lip is nice and low, so lugging heavy items in is easy. It’s also ideal if you have an old dog, as they don’t have far to jump up into the boot. The Berlingo would make an ideal car for those who have dogs, as it has a cage built-in and there’s a 12V socket in the back for a hoover to clean up all the hairs. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories If it’s a plush interior you want, the Berlingo probably isn’t for you. Despite the dull design, everything feels robust and there’s enough tech on board for most people There's a compromise to be made for the Citroen Berlingo’s van-like practicality, and that’s a decidedly van-like interior. There are no soft touch plastics in sight, and there’s only a couple of gloss black flashes to liven up this otherwise dull cabin. If you’re after a family car which feels more posh, a Renault Austral could be worth considering. Still, everything has a solid and robust feeling to it, and all that hard plastic will be easy to keep clean making it well-suited to family life. If you do want to add a pop of colour, the Flair XTR model gets a green dashboard and green details on the seats. In terms of infotainment, all Berlingos get an 8.0-inch touchscreen as standard. It’s a fairly average system with decent enough graphics, but it’s not all that responsive. The screen you get in a SEAT Tarraco is easier to use on the move. There’s also Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, connected through a wire, so you can use your phone for things like sat nav and music streaming. You can’t get a digital driver’s display on the petrol Berlingo like you can on the electric version. All internal combustion models get traditional dials with a small display in between but it displays all your vital information in a clear and concise way, and the dials are easy to read. Finding your way around the controls is easy, because everything is logically laid out. You get physical buttons for the climate control, so they aren’t buried in the touchscreen like on the Peugeot 5008 , for example. MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax You have a choice of three engines in the Berlingo, one petrol and two diesels. The petrol comes in the form of a 1.2-litre three-cylinder unit with 110hp, and it’s only available with a six-speed manual gearbox. It’ll return around 37mpg, and accelerates from 0-60mph in a pedestrian 11.5 seconds. If you’re after the most fuel-efficient Berlingo, the 101hp 1.5-litre diesel will return 54mpg. There is a trade-off for the economy, and that’s a distinct lack of performance. This engine is even slower than the petrol, with 0-60mph taking 14.1 seconds. If you spend a lot of time on the motorway, the 130hp diesel is a better bet. It’s only available with an eight-speed automatic gearbox, and it’ll do 51mpg. The added power makes overtaking a lot easier, however both diesel engines are pretty noisy under acceleration. Company car buyers will be better off looking at the all-electric E-Berlingo, because that car offers much cheaper benefit in kind tax. The 101hp diesel is the cheapest to tax of the three fuel-burners thanks to its lower emissions. Safety and security Safety and security The Citroen Berlingo scored four out of five stars in its 2018 Euro NCAP safety tests, so it’ll protect you pretty well should the worst happen. It was marked down slightly in the pedestrian protection category, something which won’t have been helped by the car’s brick-like shape. You get a good amount of safety kit as standard to help prevent a crash, with all cars getting active lane-keeping assist, autonomous emergency braking, driver attention alert and traffic sign recognition. There are also plenty of airbags around the cabin to protect you and your passengers in the event of an accident. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems The Berlingo doesn’t have any reliability horror stories attached to it, with most owners finding them to be dependable family runarounds. For added peace of mind, all new Citroens come with a three-year, or 60,000 mile warranty. This is pretty standard for a lot of brands, but it’s not as impressive as the seven-year cover you get with a Kia Sorento."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/4-series-convertible,BMW 4 Series Convertible Review & Prices,"€71,513",8/10,new,"Is the BMW 4 Series Convertible a good car? Is the BMW 4 Series Convertible a good car? The BMW 4 Series Convertible is a posh drop-top that goes up against roofless versions of the Mercedes C-Class Coupe and Audi A5 . It’s a hoot to drive on a twisty road, can seat four adults in reasonable comfort, and makes for a rather fantastic long-distance cruiser – and updates coming in 2024 should only improve things. Provided you can get on board with that buck-toothed front end (comparisons have been made to everything from an angry beaver to the original Predator), you’ll find it to be a very tough car to dislike. Think of it like you would a plate of haggis: it might not look too appetising on the surface, but give it a chance and you’ll find that it’s properly delicious. There are a number of reasons for this. For starters, its cabin is a really plush, comfortable place to spend time (at least it is up front). Practically all the surfaces that are directly in your eyeline are finished in expensive feeling leather or other soft-touch materials; and everything feels really well-screwed together. The infotainment system is tip-top, there’s decent storage, and the front seats are really comfy too. Of course, with only two doors instead of four, climbing into the back seats is a bit more of an effort than it is in the regular 3 Series saloon to which this car is so closely related, and there isn’t as much passenger space back there either. Boot space also takes a pretty hefty hit because of the folding roof, but there’s still enough room for four adults and a small amount of weekend luggage to fit inside in reasonable comfort. Still, that slight dip in practicality is easy enough to forgive when you get it out on the road. As with the 4 Series Coupe , you can have the drop-top model with a couple of four-cylinder petrol and diesel engines (there’s a six-cylinder diesel too), as well as a smooth, powerful six-cylinder petrol model called the M440i xDrive. We opted for the latter for our test drive, and if you can stomach the near £60,000 asking price and heightened fuel consumption, then you should. Not only does it lend the 4 Series fantastic pace in a straight line, the 374hp engine also sounds great when you’ve got the roof down and (not too much) wind in your hair. It rides well, too. Our range-topping M440i gets adaptive dampers as standard, which let you choose between a softer suspension setting for motorway cruising; or a firmer set-up for when you want to have a bit of fun on a twisty road. It’s a pretty fantastic driving machine in both environments, so it’s a pity that the lower-rung models don’t get the adaptive dampers as standard. Instead, they get BMW’s fixed M Sport set up, which is a bit on the firm side at low speeds. You’ll have to fork out £2,300 for the M Sport Pro Pack if you want those fancy adaptive dampers, and the desirable (but expensive) options list doesn’t end there. Adaptive cruise control comes as part of the £3650 Technology Plus Pack; and the Comfort Pack (which includes a heated steering wheel and a wind deflector) is £1350. All of that makes the BMW 4 Series Convertible a pretty pricey car – particularly if you opt for the range-topping M440i xDrive and add in a few options. But it’s tough to deny just how enjoyable it is to drive in practically all environments. So if you can get on board with the toothy looks, then why not take a look at our BMW 4 Series Convertible deals to see how much you can save through carwow?

Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort Comfortable at a cruise and fun on a twisty road – the 4 Series Convertible is an impressive all-rounder. You’ll have to pay extra for clever suspension, though Unsurprisingly, the 4 Series Convertible gets the same choice of engines as the regular 4 Series coupe – but that’s no bad thing. So there are a handful of 2.0-litre, four-cylinder petrol and diesel power plants to choose from, with outputs ranging from 184hp to 258hp. The 190hp 420d diesel will be a good choice if you spend a lot of time on the motorway and need to prioritise frugal efficiency; while the 258hp 430i petrol will be a bit more enjoyable on a twisty road but will drink a bit more. If you really want to treat yourself, there are a couple of six-cylinder diesel and petrol engines available too. The 286hp 430d blends plenty of usable performance with decent enough fuel efficiency on longer runs, but it’s not quite as frugal as its four-cylinder counterpart. Then there’s the range-topping M440i xDrive, which gets a 374hp six-cylinder petrol engine and will hit 60mph from a standstill in 4.9sec. It’s currently the quickest 4 Series Convertible available (and the only one with four-wheel drive), but that additional performance comes with a pretty healthy appetite for fuel – we certainly didn’t hit BMW’s claimed figure of 38.2mpg during our time with the car. With the roof down and its standard-fit adaptive suspension set to the comfiest setting, the M440i xDrive makes for an impressively relaxing drive around town. It doesn’t crash over potholes and bumps in the road too badly (though there is still an obvious performance car streak here), visibility is really good – particularly out the back, and the steering is nicely weighted and very accurate. At lower speeds there isn’t much wind buffeting at all, and even when you’re travelling at a quicker pace you can only really feel the very top of your head being blown around by the wind. And if you happen to find that slight amount of buffeting to be a bit too much, you can option the £1350 Comfort Pack, which adds a wind deflector into the mix. This also includes a heated steering wheel and a ‘warm air collar’ that blows, well, warm air on your neck from the headrest. With the roof in place the M440i xDrive remains really very comfortable out on the motorway, even if its standard-fit run-flat tyres do make quite a lot of noise at pace. Still, there’s not a lot of wind noise, and those adaptive dampers soak up practically everything a faster motorway will throw at it. This is a really, really good long-distance cruiser. That said, it’s at it’]s most entertaining on a twisty road. With no roof and a bit less structural rigidity than its coupe counterpart, it’s perhaps not quite as sharp through the bends, but the steering is really nicely weighted and the car goes exactly where you point it. Firm the suspension up and it doesn’t roll about too much, and thanks to four-wheel-drive there’s a healthy amount of grip on offer too – even when conditions underfoot are a bit slippery. But it might well be the six-cylinder petrol engine you enjoy the most. With the roof down and the car in sport mode, you can really take in its aggressive growl, and marvel at just how smoothly it accelerates. The eight-speed automatic transmission is impressively responsive too, and you can change gears manually via the paddles on the steering wheel if you really want to rev the engine out. Space and practicality Space and practicality You’ll be able to fit four adults in easily enough, but it’s not as comfortable as the 4 Series coupe. Boot space takes a hit, too The front half of the cabin doesn’t come up short on space for any random bits and bobs that you might want to bring along with you. The door bins are a good size and can hold an average-sized drink bottle easily enough, and there are plenty of storage trays and cubbies on the centre console. You won’t be too poorly catered for in the second row, either. In place of a traditional middle seat you’ll find two cupholders, and there are a couple of storage bins just behind the front doors too. All versions of the 4 Series Convertible come with chunky sports seats as standard. They’re generously bolstered to keep you held in place when you’re on a twisty road, but they’re also soft and supportive enough to ensure you remain comfortable over longer journeys too. You can adjust them electronically too, so getting settled in behind the thick-rimmed M Sport steering wheel is an easy process. The back seats aren’t quite as comfortable, obviously, but there’s still enough in the way of kneeroom and headroom to keep averagely tall adult passengers happy – even if those seats are set a bit more upright than they are in the coupe model. Still, if you’re short of headroom in the back, a press of a button is all you need to fold the roof away and open the cabin up to the elements. Of course, with only two doors instead of the four you get on the closely related 3 Series Saloon getting in the back is a bit more of a process, but at least you can make life a bit easier by retracting the roof first. This is where the convertible 4 Series takes a bit of a hit over the coupe model. Where the hard-top car gets a handy 440-litre boot, the convertible has to make do with a smaller 385-litre boot. That drop in usable space is down to the fact that the convertible roof effectively folds away into the top of the boot itself. So if you want an open-air experience in your 4 Series, just know that you won’t be able to bring quite as much luggage along with you than if you’d gone for the coupe. The boot opening itself is pretty narrow too, and because the roof mechanism sort of hangs down into the boot cavity, loading bulky items such as solid suitcases could be tricky. Soft weekend bags will fit just fine though. Interior style, infotainent and accessories Interior style, infotainent and accessories The 4 Series Convertible doesn’t have the flashiest cabin in the world, but it’s well made and the material selection is tip-top The 4 Series Convertible’s cabin might not look quite as flashy as a drop-top Mercedes C-Class, but when it comes to a sense of sturdiness and excellent material quality, it’s the BMW that comes out on top. The dash fascia, centre console and doors come finished in plenty of piano black and metallic-effect trim surfaces, while plush feeling soft-touch material covers the dash top. You get leather upholstery as standard on the 4 Series Convertible, as well as chunky sports seats. There are a range of different upholstery colours available too, so if the standard black is a bit too dull for your tastes you can easily brighten things up. The range-topping M440i xDrive can also be optioned up with super posh Merino leather – for a price, of course. BMW’s latest iDrive infotainment system is one of the best currently on the market. Not only is the operating system easy to figure out and navigate using either the touchscreen or the rotary control dial; the graphics are sharp and clear, and it comes loaded with a handy amount of kit right out of the box. All models get satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay , and Android Auto as standard, as well as Bluetooth connectivity and DAB radio to name but a few features. If you want a head-up display that project useful driving information onto the windscreen, as well as an uprated Harmon/Kardon sound system and 360-degree parking camera, you can option the Technology Pack Plus for £3650."

The BMW 5 Series Touring is a posh estate car with a plug-in hybrid engine that makes it ideal as a practical family car , or for company car drivers looking for something comfortable to rack up miles in. It’s a bit like a Burberry backpack, because it’s posh and practical in equal measure. SUVs might be the on-trend choice, but there are plenty of estate alternatives to consider if you prefer to sit lower in the car. Other posh estates include the Audi A6 Avant and Mercedes E-Class Estate , or you could opt for a well-specced Volkswagen Passat . The 5 Series Touring isn’t the best-looking car, with odd angular lines in the bodywork that never feel quite as cohesive as more elegantly styled generations of old. Things get better inside, though, with a clean design for the most part. You get a smart piece of trim splitting the dashboard widthways and a pair of screens above this. BMW’s infotainment tech is some of the best in the business, with crisp displays and intuitive menu navigation. Boot space is up on the BMW 5 Series Saloon , increasing from that car’s 520 litres to 570 litres. Not a huge leap, but the more boxy shape should make it easier to load large items. It’s worth noting the Mercedes E-Class Estate has a roomier boot than this and the Audi A6 Avant, with the BMW’s boot the smallest of the trio. At launch, there’s just the one plug-in hybrid engine option. Called 530e, it combines a 2.0-litre petrol engine with an electric motor to make 184hp, while the battery provides a range of nearly 60 miles. This will be particularly appealing to company car drivers because of the favourable Benefit-in-Kind rate, though for the same reason the all-electric i5 Touring is also worth a look. Another plug-in hybrid, as well as a regular petrol engine, will join the line-up later. Although we’ve not been behind the wheel of this new model just yet, it’s likely to drive very much like the 5 Series Saloon. As such, you can expect a refined and comfortable car that’s at its best at motorway speeds, though perhaps not as much fun on a twisty road as its predecessors. If you’re interested in this car, find out how much you could save with Carwow’s BMW 5 Series Touring deals. You can also get a great price on a used 5 Series Touring, as well as other used BMW models. If you want to sell your car online , Carwow can help with that, too. How much is the BMW 5 Series Touring? How much is the BMW 5 Series Touring? To begin with, the BMW 5 Series Touring is only available in M Sport or M Sport Pro trim with a plug-in hybrid engine. Prices start at less than £62,000, but add a couple of equipment packs and that can rise to more than £72,000. That means its starting price is currently higher than alternatives, but it’s less than the entry price of a Mercedes E-Class Estate hybrid (about £67,000) and only a bit more than the Audi A6 Avant hybrid (circa £61,000)."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/i5-touring,BMW i5 Touring Review & Prices,"€106,330",9/10,new,"Is the BMW i5 Touring a good car? Is the BMW i5 Touring a good car? The BMW i5 Touring is an electric estate car , which means it’s a very rare thing indeed. You get the same posh interior and silent running as the i5 saloon , but with a bit more practicality. It’s like a North Face duffle bag, because it’s big, practical and has designer appeal. It's also extremely good - so good, it picked up Highly Commended in the Comfortable Cruiser category of the 2025 Carwow Car of the Year Awards . As it stands, the only other electric estates in this price range are the Volkswagen ID7 Tourer and the Audi A6 Avant e-tron , so you might also cross-shop the i5 Touring with electric SUVs such as the BMW iX , Audi Q8 e-tron and Polestar 3 . BMW’s modern styling is certainly an acquired taste, but with the i5 we’re either getting used to it or the styling department is finding its groove, because it’s a much more cohesive design than other recent models such as the iX. There are plenty of sharp angles and creases in the bodywork that give it a distinctive appearance, though base models get softer styling that looks a bit plain. There can be no complaints about the interior though, because it’s a lovely place to eat up miles. The seats are soft and there are quality materials throughout, and all trim levels get the same high quality twin-screen infotainment displays. They look great with clear graphics, though the menus can be really confusing to navigate around. Range: 279 - 343 miles Efficiency: 3.0 - 3.7 miles/kWh Battery size: 84kWh Max charge speed: 205kW Charge time AC: 12h 30mins, 0-100%, 7.4kW Charge time DC: 30mins, 10-80%, 205kW Charge port location: Right side rear Power outputs: 340hp / 601hp It’s spacious too, with plenty of adjustment to get yourself comfortable – you don’t get the same commanding view as an SUV , but the upside is that you feel more snug within the cockpit, rather than sat atop it. Storage is good in the front and there’s loads of room in the back seats, too. The main advantage of the estate body shape is that the BMW i5 Touring has a big boot – at 570 litres it should be enough space for the vast majority of people, and more space than any of the electric SUVs mentioned above, though the VW ID7 Tourer estate has more space still if you really need it. There are two motor options to choose between, with the eDrive40 being the more affordable car to buy and to run, with a top-of-the-range M60 also available with ludicrous performance at the expense of range. As such, the eDrive40 can go up to 348 miles between charges, compared with 314 miles for the M60, which puts it behind what alternatives such as the Audi A6 Avant e-tron (437 miles) and Polestar 3 (403 miles) are capable of. Regardless, the way the BMW i5 Touring chews through those miles is incredibly impressive, because it’s one of the most comfortable, quiet and refined cars on sale today. You feel utterly cocooned from the outside world. That means it’s a great motorway cruiser, but also means pothole-riddled inner-city roads and bumpy B-roads do little to unsettle the car. It’s fairly composed going around corners, with little in the way of body roll, but you really do feel its weight, so it’s not a car that encourages you to drive it like a sports car. However, if you’re looking for a comfortable and refined car to cruise around in, the BMW i5 Touring has very few weak points, most of which are worthy sacrifices for something so comfortable and practical. If you’re interested, check out the latest BMW i5 Touring deals available on Carwow, or if you don’t need all that space we have i5 Saloon deals , too. You can also browse used BMW models from our network of trusted dealers, and when it’s time to sell your car , Carwow can help with that, too. How much is the BMW i5 Touring? How much is the BMW i5 Touring? There’s no getting away from the fact that the BMW i5 Touring can get very expensive. The non-performance version is fairly reasonable, as it starts from about the same as the Audi A6 Avant e-tron, though you can get a VW ID7 Tourer for nearly £20,000 less. It’s nowhere near as posh, but that’s a hugely tempting saving. That said, the i5 Touring is priced very similarly to a few excellent electric SUVs, including the Audi Q8 e-tron, Polestar 3, and BMW’s own iX. Things start to get a bit out of hand if you go for the powerful M60 version, where you’ll only get loose change from £100,000 before you even tick any option boxes. Our test car was an M60 with a few packages added, and it came to more than £120,000… Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort The BMW i5 Touring is incredibly comfortable and relaxing to drive, but it’s not much fun in corners The BMW i5 Touring isn’t exactly a small car , but its punchy electric motor and incredibly comfortable suspension mean that it’s actually a lovely thing to pootle around town in. Whichever motor you go for there’s enough performance to nip into gaps in traffic, yet noises from outside are kept to a minimum, so even heavy city traffic becomes (relatively) stress free. Furthermore the brakes are really well judged. Some electric cars have grabby brakes that make smooth progress tricky, but the i5 Touring has no such issues, and you can adjust the amount of regenerative braking so you barely have to touch the brakes at all. At higher speeds there’s no let up in the impressive refinement. Whatever speed you’re doing, wind and road noise are kept to a minimum. You get the feeling you could max the car out on derestricted German Autobahn and still be able to whisper to your passenger. Our test car came with the expensive M Adaptive Suspension Pro option, which lowers the car for a sportier stance, but if you put it into its comfort-focused setting you would never know it has a sportier edge, because it soaks up bumps in the road beautifully. Perhaps the only downside is that the i5 Touring’s range isn’t quite up there with the best alternatives – the Polestar 3 and Audi A6 Avant e-tron have versions that can go 400-plus miles to the BMW’s 343-mile maximum – but the 10-80% fast charge time of 30 minutes is about typical. BMW has a reputation for building practical family cars that are as fun to drive as some more performance-focused machinery, and while the i5 Touring is certainly satisfying to drive, it’s not exactly fun. You can get into a rhythm with the car, but it feels very heavy and a touch cumbersome in turns. That’s true of most big electric cars, though. If you have the budget to step up to the M60 model then it makes up for this somewhat with its ludicrous power output. With 601hp under your right foot and all-wheel drive grip, you can take it easy through a bend and absolutely catapult yourself out the other side. Space and practicality Space and practicality The BMW i5 Touring has a practical cabin and a bigger boot than most alternatives, but storage in the back isn’t great It’s easy to get comfortable in the BMW i5 Touring. The steering wheel and seat have plenty of adjustment (though you might wish you could go slightly lower if you like a sporty feel) and there’s a good amount of space around you. Storage is decent too, with large door bins that can take a big bottle, while more space can be found beneath the armrest, which can be opened to either side so those in the back have easy access too. You also get a felt-lined glovebox of useful proportions. Beneath the touchscreen and ahead of a couple of cup holders is a space to charge two phones wirelessly. You also get a pair of USB-C slots if you prefer to charge your phone the old-fashioned way. There’s loads of legroom and headroom in the back of the BMW i5 Touring. In fact, it’s more spacious than the old 5 Series, because this latest model is a bit bigger. There are some negatives though, because the floor is a bit high to accommodate the batteries, so your thighs don’t get much support from the cushion. If you’re sitting in the middle there’s a hump in the floor, because the i5 shares its construction with the petrol-powered 5 Series . Most bespoke electric cars have flat floors in the rear, making it easier to slide across or place your feet. Storage isn’t great either, with door bins that will take a bottle and not much else. You don’t even get pockets on the backs of the seats in front. Being an estate, one of the BMW i5 Touring’s real selling points is its practical boot. You get 570 litres, which is considerably bigger than an Audi A6 Avant e-tron (502 litres), BMW iX (500 litres) and Polestar 3 (484 litres). It’s a single litre bigger than the Audi Q8 e-tron, with only the VW ID7 Tourer’s cavernous 605-litre boot beating it. You get a nice square load area that makes it easy to make the most of the space, and the tall roof means loading large items is much easier than it would be in the saloon version. You’ll find small netted pockets on either side of the boot, and you can lift the rear half of the floor to get to some more storage space, which is useful for things like charging cables. The rear seats are easily folded using chunky levers in easy reach on the sides of the boot to open up a hefty 1,700 litres of space. There’s no front boot under the bonnet, though, unlike in a Polestar 3. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior quality and comfort is excellent, but the infotainment can be pretty confusing to use While BMW’s exterior styling might be Marmite, there can be no controversy about its interiors. The i5 Touring’s cabin is a lovely place to sit, with seats like comfortable armchairs and quality materials throughout – though it’s perhaps a bit more premium than luxury, if we’re being picky, given the price. The two displays on the dashboard dominate your view – there’s a 12.3-inch display behind the steering wheel and a 14.9-inch touchscreen in the centre. Both look fantastic behind a single curved binnacle, with sharp graphics, snappy responses and iPad-fast loading times. You can even use a dial down on the centre console to navigate around, which is a bit easier on the move than just using the touchscreen. The only downside is that the menu layouts are really confusing, so it’s not particularly intuitive finding lesser-used menus and settings. An ambient light bar goes from each door all the way across the dashboard, splitting the upper and lower sections. In truth it looks a bit tacky during the day, but works really well at night. Dashboard trims vary depending on the model you go for, from light grey to a carbon-fibre or wood effect, and there’s plenty of choice of upholstery colours, so you can have it as light or as dark as you like. Electric range, charging and tax Electric range, charging and tax There’s only one battery available in the BMW i5 Touring, which has an 84kWh capacity. How far that gets you between charges depends on which motor and trim you go for (as well as how sensibly you drive, of course). Unless you want supercar performance from your practical estate, you probably want the rear-wheel drive eDrive40, which still makes a healthy 340hp. Official figures suggest up to 343 miles is possible, though expect about 300-320 miles in normal driving. If you go for the pricey M60 option you get all-wheel drive and 601hp – it really is astonishingly fast, and perhaps most impressive of all, has no trouble putting all of that power into the road for exhilarating launches. This power does drop the range to 310 miles in official tests, though plan for 250 miles in the real world (or less if you enjoy all that power a little too often). Fast charging takes 30 minutes from 10-80%, with a maximum charge rate of 205kW. Although some alternatives have higher peaks, the 10-80% time is pretty much identical to what those cars manage. As with any electric car, there’s no Vehicle Excise Duty to pay until 2025, and you don’t have to worry about the surcharge for expensive cars, either. It also means you get super-cheap company car tax rates, too. Safety and security Safety and security Although the BMW i5 Touring has not been safety tested by Euro NCAP , the saloon model has, and scored the full five stars. Although there were no particularly stand out areas, its ratings of 86% for vulnerable road users and 78% for its safety assist systems are pretty good compared with most other cars. Standard safety and assistance tech includes adaptive cruise control, a parking assistant and adaptive LED headlights, while M Sport models get better brakes. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems The BMW i5 Touring is a new model, so it’s not possible to know how reliable it will be. However, BMW had a mid-table finish in the latest Driver Power owner satisfaction survey, performing much better than Mercedes and Audi. BMW’s warranty is about the same as other premium brands at three years, though the fact that you get unlimited mileage is a nice addition. For ‘i’ models like the i5, this also includes roadside assistance and an eight-year/100,000-mile warranty for the main drive battery."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/z4,BMW Z4 Review & Prices,"€65,649",7/10,new,"Is the BMW Z4 a good car? Is the BMW Z4 a good car? This is the BMW Z4, a convertible sports car that’s a bit more grown up and refined than some of its alternatives. It’s like an older married couple sipping gin and tonic at the wedding bar, while the Porsche 718 Boxster and Audi TT Roadster are like the energetic kids careening around the dancefloor and skidding on their knees. That’s not to say that BMW Z4 isn’t fun to drive. Particularly in more powerful M40i guise – there’s also a slightly uninspiring sDrive20i model – it’s a brawny performance car with an engine that barks angrily as it catapults you down the road. But point it at a twisty road and it’s not quite as agile as the Porsche and the Audi , which feel small enough to tackle tight British countryside roads and give you confidence that the tyres have loads of grip in corners. The BMW feels bigger and, while it has loads of clever tech to make it handle well, feels like it’s floating over the road rather than biting into the surface. If you’re looking for a sporty road car that would be just as happy on a race track, the Z4 doesn’t quite hit the mark. It lacks that giggle-inducing character the 718 Boxster and TT have. But where it excels is, well, just about everywhere else. The suspension is comfortable enough to cruise about town without jolting you around at every hint of a pothole, and despite the fabric roof, it’s quiet enough to have a conversation with your passenger even at motorway speeds. And sure, the interior doesn’t quite have the visual drama of the exterior (which is properly head-turning, particularly in the gorgeous Portimao Blue paint), but it’s all very functional and trimmed to the highest quality. You also get one of the best infotainment systems in the business; it’s closer to a cosy 3 Series than a pared back sports car. Naturally, the 3 Series comparisons fall apart when it comes to space and practicality, but compared with similar cars you’re not too cramped and there are some useful cubby holes, while the boot is the same capacity as the TT Roadster and bigger than you’ll find in the Porsche. The BMW Z4 is a two-seater, though, so if you want rear seats you could consider the Ford Mustang Convertible or BMW’s own 4 Series Convertible . Ultimately, the BMW Z4 is a fantastic all-round sports car. It doesn’t quite have the cornering prowess of alternatives, but it has more than enough ability to put a smile on your face. And if you’re looking for a comfortable, posh convertible to make the most of sunny road trips, it’s a fantastic option. See how much you could save through carwow by checking out our BMW Z4 deals page, or browse used Z4 models . You can also take a look at other used BMWs , and when it’s time to sell your car , carwow can help with that, too. How much is the BMW Z4? How much is the BMW Z4? Despite its upmarket image, the BMW Z4 is competitively priced among alternatives. The Audi TT Roadster has a lower starting price, but the pair are evenly matched among their more powerful, top-spec variants. The BMW Z4 starts at around £45,000 for the 2.0-litre-engined M Sport model, but it’s more than £10,000 extra for the 3.0-litre M40i, so you certainly have to pay for the extra performance. Porsche 718 Boxster prices can get astronomical because there are hardcore, track-focused motorsport-inspired versions. But again, looking at like-for-like models, the M40i Z4 costs around £5,000 less than a 718 Boxster S. The left-field choice is the Ford Mustang Convertible. It sits at the top of the Z4 price range, but you do get a beefy V8 engine that sounds fantastic. The other advantage is two (small) rear seats, but the interior is nowhere near as fancy as the BMW’s. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort Although the BMW Z4 lacks some of the agility of alternatives in corners, it’s a comfortable, refined cruiser There are usually some compromises to be made when driving around town in a sports car, and that’s somewhat true of the BMW Z4. You sit low to the ground and the car’s long bonnet and wide rear mean it’s not the easiest thing to place on narrow streets, and rear visibility in particular is hampered with the roof up. At least you get front and rear parking sensors as standard that will warn if you’ve misjudged the car’s extremities. All that being said, the suspension is comfortable, so potholes and rough road surfaces are ironed out better than most alternatives. That’s the trade off for not being the most dynamic option. The steering is light too, so tight manoeuvres require little effort. Being more comfort-oriented than some of its sports car peers, the BMW Z4 lends itself well to life cruising on the open road. This is especially the case when you close the fabric roof, with wind noise being kept to a minimum and, despite the big 19-inch wheels on the M40i, not much road noise by sports car standards, either. You won’t have to raise your voice to be heard. On bright sunny days, the BMW is great to cruise about in with the roof down, though at motorway speeds there is quite a bit of wind buffeting. Fortunately, you get a wind deflector (a piece of material that slots between the headrests to reduce wind buffeting) as standard to keep your hair in-check, and there's also a heated steering wheel upgrade that'll make drop-top driving cosier during winter. All models get regular cruise control as standard, but you’ll have to pay extra for adaptive cruise as part of the Driving Assistant pack. This also adds lane-keeping assistance, but feels a bit stingy given the Z4’s upmarket image and price. If you want the most exciting BMW Z4 you can buy, go for the M40i. It has more power than the sDrive20i as well as better brakes, a sporty differential that helps put power down, and adaptive suspension that lets you switch between a sportier or comfier setup. In isolation, the M40i is great fun on a twisty road, because it has the power to punch you out of a corner and sounds fantastic doing so. However, you don’t get the reassuring sense through the steering wheel that the tyres are gripping the Tarmac. The Audi TT Roadster and Porsche 718 Boxster do a better job of this, so they feel more direct when turning into a corner and inspire more confidence, which ultimately makes them more capable as well as more fun. It’s also worth noting that the BMW Z4 is only available with an automatic gearbox . If you want a manual gearbox and don’t need the convertible, consider the Toyota Supra . It’s mechanically similar to the Z4 but has been tuned to be sportier than the BMW, so it’s brilliant in corners. Space and practicality Space and practicality Compared with similar sports cars, the BMW Z4 is pretty spacious inside and its boot is a good size, but the lack of rear seats could be off-putting If space and practicality are important, a two-seater sports car is probably the wrong place to look. But if you’re looking to maximise space from this type of car then the BMW Z4 is a great choice. You sit low to the ground but there’s a decent amount of space around you so you’re not rubbing shoulders with your passenger, and even tall drivers won’t find their head touching the fabric roof when it’s in place. There are also some useful cubby holes, with narrow door bins, a small space beneath the dashboard to charge your phone, and the armrest has a couple of cupholders – though it’s slightly annoying that you have to drive around with this open if you want to keep your latte secure. There are no back seats in the BMW Z4, because it’s strictly a two-seater. This is also the case with the Porsche 718 Boxster and the Audi TT Roadster. If you want a four-seat convertible, there are a few options to consider, including BMW’s own 4 Series Convertible. The Ford Mustang Convertible sits at the top of the Z4’s price range, while the Porsche 911 Cabriolet could be in the mix, but it is around twice the price of the BMW… The BMW Z4 has 281 litres of boot space – regardless of whether the roof is up or down. That’s almost exactly the same size as the Audi TT Roadster’s boot (280 litres)and a bit more than the combined pokey front and rear load bays in a Porsche 718 Boxster (275 litrea). The boot opening isn’t particularly deep but it’s wide enough to lift in a set of golf clubs without any hassle, or there’s room for a pair of small suitcases with space left over for a few soft bags. You get some tether points and an elasticated strap, as well as a ski hatch fitted between the seats to let you carry long luggage poking through from the boot. You’ll need to make sure you tie things down carefully when using this, though, or you may find items sliding forwards and hitting the gear selector when you brake hard. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories The BMW Z4’s interior is well-made with a great infotainment system, but the design is a bit dull The BMW Z4 looks smart inside, but it doesn’t feel particularly sporty – especially when you compare it with the flashy cabins in the Audi TT Roadster and Porsche 718 Boxster. Sure, you get body-hugging seats as standard and a raised centre console to make you feel cocooned inside, but the infotainment display, air vents and digital instrument display look no different to those you get in a well-specced 3 Series. That being said, almost everything you touch feels very plush indeed. Bar a few hard surfaces by the sides of the centre console, the plastics on the dashboard and doors feel soft and the brushed metal-effect trims are pretty lovely, too. BMW’s infotainment system is one of the best in the business. You get a 10.0-inch touchscreen on the dashboard and a 12.0-inch display in front of the steering wheel, which replaces old-fashioned analogue dials, though this isn’t quite as elaborate as the one in the TT. Regardless, the infotainment system is a breeze to use, whether you use the touchscreen, voice assistant or rotary dial. It’s quick to respond to inputs and the menus are all logically laid out, while Apple CarPlay and Android Auto mean you can sync easily with your phone. MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax You have a choice of two petrol engines in the BMW Z4, both of which come with rear-wheel drive and have an eight-speed automatic transmission with paddles that let you shift manually if you’d prefer. The entry-level model is the sDrive20i, which uses a 2.0-litre engine and makes 197hp. With a 0-62mph time of 6.6 seconds it’s fairly quick, but it doesn’t have the performance the Z4’s looks deserve. What you really want, budget-allowing, is the M40i. This uses a 3.0-litre engine that makes a much healthier 340hp, and brings the 0-62mph time down to 4.5 seconds. At about £12,000 more than the regular model, though, it’s not a cheap option. The trade off for that extra performance is worse fuel economy. While the 2.0-litre model hits up to 40.9mpg in official tests, the 3.0-litre version tops out at 35.8mpg – though this isn’t drastically worse, the reality is that you’ll be spending more time at the pump with the M40i. CO2 emissions are also higher in the M40i, hitting up to 184g/km compared with 166g/km in the sDrive20i, meaning you will pay a bit more in first-year road tax and company car tax . Safety and security Safety and security The BMW Z4 scored five-out-of-five stars in Euro NCAP safety testing, and its 97% rating for adult occupant protection and 91% in the vulnerable road user section are particularly noteworthy. Tests have become a bit more strict since it went through in 2019, though. As standard you get front and rear parking sensors, basic cruise control and a forward collision warning system. M40i models don’t get any extra safety kit, aside from the improved brakes. If you want more advanced assistance technology, you will have to jump into the pricey option packages. The Driving Assistance pack adds adaptive cruise control and lane-keeping assistance, while you can opt for an automatic parking assistant on its own, or as part of the Technology Pack, which also includes a fancy Harman Kardon sound system and head-up display . Reliability and problems Reliability and problems Because the BMW Z4 is not a high volume car, detailed reliability data is quite tricky to come by. However, the fact there are no obvious warning signs should be somewhat reassuring. BMW has a fairly middling reputation for reliability, but it’s worth noting that as a premium brand and a sporty car, any repairs and maintenance you carry out are likely to cost more than a typical car. The BMW Z4 gets the same three-year, unlimited mileage warranty as the rest of the company’s range. That’s not bad, with most companies offering a similar timeframe but with limited mileage. All ‘approved used’ models come with a 12-month manufacturer warranty, and you can pay for longer coverage if desired."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/x4,BMW X4 Review & Prices,"€72,959",7/10,new,"Is the BMW X4 a good car? Is the BMW X4 a good car? The BMW X4 is based on the old X3 , and it’s a sleeker, sportier-looking SUV that tries to convince you that it’s a coupe . It sits between the X2 and the X6 in terms of size, and while it’s not as practical as the X3, it’s arguably the more stylish car. It’s like a chic tote bag instead of a big, roomy suitcase. Not as useful, but rather more fashionable. Inside, the X4 doesn’t have the high-tech, big-screen setup of the new X3, and nor does it have the latest tech boasted by the Mercedes GLC Coupe , but the quality levels are very high and it’s a well-designed cabin. While the X4 doesn’t get the new X3’s big, sweeping digital screen dashboard, it does stick with the old separate instrument panel and touchscreen, both 12.3 inches across. The big screen in the middle uses older iDrive software that’s still good to use, and it’s easier to control on the move than a touchscreen-only system thanks to the click-wheel controller down on the console. Up front, there’s plenty of space even if you’re tall, and the adjustable steering wheel and excellent sports seats mean that the driving position is both very good and very comfortable. In the back seats, legroom is fine but that sloping roofline means that tall rear seat passengers will find that their heads are brushing the ceiling, and it’s a bit dark and gloomy back there. The boot is actually pretty good — it holds just 45 litres less than the roomy new X3, at least when you measure up to the luggage cover — and the floor is flat, with no loading lip so it’s easy to heft heavy items up and into the boot. The rear seats fold flat, and they split 40:20:40 for maximum practicality, but you do lose a good bit of seats-down space compared to the X3 — a full 200 litres. The standard X4’s engine choice is limited to just two diesels now. If you go for a sporty M model, there’s a bit more choice, with a more powerful straight-six petrol and straight-six diesel, and even a full-on 510hp X4 M if you really want to go nuts. All models come with BMW’s xDrive four-wheel drive as standard, and all come with an eight-speed automatic gearbox. The X4 is actually quite frugal, at least in 2.0-litre xDrive20d diesel form. Thanks to that four-wheel drive system being able to disconnect the front wheels to save fuel, 49mpg is theoretically possible, with low-40s being a realistic goal. It’s still quick, hitting 62mph in 7.9 seconds, which is fine unless you truly crave the 3.8 seconds of the X4 M… For a big 4x4, the X4 is decent to drive, and keeps its composure when traversing a bumpy, twisty British B-road. The xDrive four-wheel drive sends a bit more power to the rear wheels than the fronts, allowing for a more enjoyable driving setup, but the steering isn’t as talkative as it ought to be, and so a Porsche Macan (the petrol one, not the electric one) makes a more engaging car on a challenging road. The X4 can be had with optional adaptive suspension, and this is a must. Not only does it sharpen up the handling for twisty roads, in Comfort mode it also makes the X4 noticeably more comfortable over bumps. Without the adaptive springs, it’s just not as comfy as a Mercedes GLC Coupe. The new BMW X3 is far more technologically advanced than this X4, and comes with the option of a plug-in hybrid engine, but if style is what matters, then the X4 is still worth considering.

You can also check out other used BMWs , and when the time comes to sell your current car , Carwow can help with that, too. How much is the BMW X4? How much is the BMW X4? The X4 is very well-priced if you compare it to the new Mercedes GLC Coupe — the BMW has an almost £5,000 price advantage. Then again, the GLC Coupe is a new design, has better cabin technology, and can be had as a plug-in hybrid. The Audi Q5 Sportback also comes with a plug-in hybrid TFSIe model, but in basic diesel form it’s every bit as well-priced as the BMW. All three German cars are overpriced if you consider the Lexus NX , which comes as standard as a hybrid and can be had as a plug-in hybrid too, which costs around £7,000 less than the cheapest X4. Likewise, the Jaguar F-Pace — roomier than the X4 but just as good to drive — is about as affordable as the Lexus in its basic form, and can be had with plug-in hybrid power. A Range Rover Velar also comes with a plug-in hybrid option, but is actually considerably more expensive than the X4 in basic form. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort The BMW X4 is as sporty to drive as you’d want it to be, but it’s not quite as refined on the motorway as some alternatives The X4 isn’t a particularly big car, so driving down narrow city streets doesn’t present too many issues. You have good visibility from the driver’s seat, too, so you easily spot any hazards that need careful negotiating. The view out of the back is virtually nonexistent, though. There are big blind spots and a tiny back window, so reversing can be tricky. At least front and rear parking sensors and a reversing camera are fitted as standard. It’s easy to find a driving position that works for you – there’s lots of adjustment in the seat and steering (electric seats are optional). An extending section of the seat base gives more thigh support for longer legs. A plug-in hybrid powertrain would be best for driving around town, but the X4 isn’t available with one, even though the closely related BMW X3 is. Instead, your choices are diesels or high performance petrol engines. The 2.0-litre, four-cylinder diesel 20d is best for town driving – it gives reasonably punchy performance, decent fuel economy and lowish CO2 emissions. Every engine is backed up by an eight-speed automatic gearbox that goes about its business so smoothly you barely notice it. The X4 is a fine long-distance cruiser. The standard suspension set-up is a little firm, though hardly uncomfortable. Choose the optional adaptive suspension and you can switch at the touch of a button from soft and squidgy to firm and sporty. The interior is really quiet, too. The diesels sound a bit rattly at low speeds but disappear into the background at 70mph. And there’s barely a hint of wind or tyre noise. You could happily do an awful lot of miles in the X4, but the Mercedes GLC Coupe is more relaxing to spend several hours in, as is a Range Rover Velar. The 190hp X4 20d gives perfectly adequate performance for motorway driving – it gets up to speed smartly and has power to spare if you need to hurry up. The more powerful six-cylinder diesels in the 30d and M40d and the similar petrol engine in the M40i aren’t anything like as efficient as the 20d on the motorway, but they’re more satisfying to drive. The automatic gearbox changes gear imperceptibly, and responds instantly if you stamp on the throttle. Basic cruise control and lane keeping assist are standard; more advanced adaptive cruise control is optional (BMW’s system is one of the best). The X4 feels almost as sporty to drive as BMW’s saloon cars . It always goes exactly where you point it and it doesn’t feel unsettled if you alter course mid-corner. The suspension keeps the body pretty much bolt upright and soaks up lumps and holes, rather than bouncing through them. The 20d engine has enough power to get a move on, but you’ll have fun with one of the much more powerful six-cylinder engines. They get you down the road much quicker and sound great. The automatic gearbox always chooses the right gear for any given moment, or you can change gear manually using the paddles on the steering wheel. Select Sport with the driving mode button down by the gear lever and the X4’s driving experience turns up a couple of notches with a sportier setting for the steering, suspension and throttle. Only the slightly light feel to the steering stops the X4 being a complete class act, and the petrol version of the Porsche Macan does the sporty SUV thing slightly better. Obviously, the super-fast X4 M is rather more thrilling on a twisty road, but this comes at the expense of comfort. In fact, the X4 M has such firm suspension, that it can sometimes feel as if it’s about to bounce you over the ditch. A softer X4 40i is actually more fun overall. Space and practicality Space and practicality The X4 is roomier inside than you might think, and the boot is surprisingly spacious, but that low roof does mean that headroom is tight in the back There’s huge space in the X4’s front seats. Only really very tall people are likely to have any issues with the leg and headroom. There’s also plenty of shoulder room but, as in every other BMW, the centre console is quite high and restricts space across the car. It’s very comfortable, though. The door bins are big, easily holding a two-litre bottle. There’s a deep cubby hole under the centre armrest (where you’ll also find some USB charging ports), a pair of cupholders in the centre console and a tray for your phone in front of the gearstick, which doubles as a wireless charging pad when you cough up for the optional Technology Pack. There’s pretty generous legroom in the back, easily enough for someone well over six-feet tall. However, the sloping roofline means they won’t have enough headroom. Passengers under six feet will be very comfortable, especially if you choose the optional Extended Storage Pack, which includes a reclining back seat. There’s just enough room for three adults to sit across the back, but the middle perch is cramped. Three kids fit much more easily. Installing a child seat is easy enough, with the ISOFIX mount covers hinged so it’s really easy to get to them. And you don’t need to move the front seats forwards to install a rear-facing seat. Just be careful not to bang your head on the low roofline. For storage, there are big door bins and a pair of cupholders in the armrest. The Extended Storage Pack also adds nets on the back of the front seats. And the back has separate heating and ventilation controls. The X4 has a smaller boot than the X3, but you can still cram a lot of stuff into its 525-litre capacity – equivalent to four big suitcases. Bear in mind that the sloping roofline means you can’t put anything particularly tall in there. The boot floor lifts up on a hydraulic strut so you don’t have to hold it. Underneath, there’s useful extra storage with cut-outs to stow the two-piece load cover when you don’t need it. The Extended Storage Pack adds various nets and tie-down points on rails for you to secure the load. The back seats drop in three sections, released by levers near the boot opening. Do that and there’s 1,430 litres of space but, again, the space is limited by the low roof. At least the loading lip is quite low, so heaving stuff into the boot is fairly easy. Hands-free boot opening is optional, but the system is a bit temperamental. Overall, the X4 is one of the more practical cars of this type – it certainly makes a good family car. But the new BMW X3 has more passenger and boot space, and so too does the Range Rover Velar. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories The X4’s cabin is an older design, but it still works well. Just watch out for some cheaper plastics The X4 is one of the few BMWs that hasn’t been given the upgrade to the big new curved screen dashboard, which runs the latest iDrive software. So instead of looking like it has a massive widescreen telly on the top of the dash, the X4 instead sticks with the old separate instruments under a binnacle behind the steering wheel, and a standalone 12.3-inch infotainment screen in the centre of the dash. Old fashioned? A little yes, certainly compared to the minimalist, high-tech interior of the new BMW X3, but there’s an argument — a partially convincing one — that the X4’s layout is both better looking (the graphics for the instrument display are certainly better looking) and easier to use (thanks to physical air conditioning controls, and a simpler menu layout for the big screen). You certainly don’t sacrifice much in the way of useful functionality compared to the newer BMW screens — there are stacks of features in the system including sat nav, Bluetooth, DAB radio and assorted useful apps. BMW’s operating system is user-friendly but you may prefer to connect your phone via Apple CarPlay or Android Auto . Other standard features include full screen sat nav maps in the instrument panel, heated leather seats, radar-guided cruise control, front and rear parking sensors and a reversing camera. You also get access to BMW’s app, which provides all sorts of information about the car and you can remotely program the sat nav, among many other cool tricks. The colour scheme is quite dark without the lighter seat upholstery options, so you can brighten the place up with the optional opening glass sunroof. There are scratchy plastics on some surfaces low down, otherwise everything you touch regularly feels like a high quality product, and everything is solidly put together. But it’s not as obviously luxurious as the Range Rover Velar, or as sporty as the Porsche Macan. MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax The X4’s fuel economy numbers are pretty good for this type of car. The 20d has an official figure of 49mpg, the 30d 45mpg, the M40d gets 41mpg and the M40i can do 31mpg. CO2 emissions range from 159-194g/km in the diesel models, up to 205-209g/km for the petrol M40i, and 244g/km for the X4 M. If you’re a private owner, vehicle excise duty costs are fairly pricey whichever model you go for, because emissions are high and every model costs more than £40,000, meaning it faces an extra cost in years two to six. The CO2 numbers are even less friendly to company car buyers – and so the company car benefit-in-kind rates are pretty chunky. A plug-in hybrid is probably the better bet for you so check out the Audi Q5 Sportback, Jaguar F-Pace, Range Rover Velar and Mercedes GLC Coupe. Or, indeed, the new BMW X3. Safety and security Safety and security Safety experts Euro NCAP awarded the X4 a full five-star safety rating, scoring it highly for adult and child occupant protection. It also comes with a comprehensive set of safety features including automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning, rear cross traffic alert and adaptive LED headlights that illuminate as much as possible without dazzling oncoming drivers. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems BMWs are generally very reliable and well made, but they are complex cars so small niggles can crop up. There have been some recalls issued for the X4, but they don’t affect brand new cars. BMW provides a three-year/unlimited mileage warranty, which is an additional benefit over the 60,000-mile limit imposed by some manufacturers if you’re a high mileage driver."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/x4-m,BMW X4 M Competition Review & Prices,"€119,771",7/10,new,"Is the BMW X4 M Competition a good car? Is the BMW X4 M Competition a good car? If you’re a Formula 1 driver with a family, what do you drive? The BMW X4 M Competition might be just the trick. For starters, it’s savagely quick and more fun to drive than you might expect, yet it’ll also do a good job of hauling luggage. It isn’t the only option, mind: a Mercedes-AMG GLC 63 S Coupe offers similar pace and space with a sloping silhouette. There’s no mistaking an X4 M Competition for just any old X4. It gets a gloss black grille, aggressive M front bumper with huge air intakes and BMW’s bold Icon LED headlights at the front. At the sides, you’ll find 21-inch M-specific alloy wheels over larger M brakes and M door mirrors finished in gloss black, while at the rear, there’s another M bumper with diffuser, M sports exhaust with gloss black tailpipes and M Competition badging. Oh, and there are rear spoilers mounted on the roof and boot lip. Inside, the M-fest continues. There are figure-hugging electric, heated M Sport seats in fancy Merino leather that come with five free leather colour choices as well as one two-tone as an option. Then there’s an M Sports steering wheel with two red M driving mode buttons, a red starter button, door sill finishers in gloss black, M seatbelts and a newly designed M gear selector. All-told the X4 M’s interior leaves you in no doubt as to its sporting intentions, but it’s also very high quality throughout. Plus, BMW’s last-generation (but still fantastic) iDrive infotainment system with a 10-inch screen on the dash, digital dials and head-up display with M-specific design and driving mode info is all standard. BMW still doesn’t include Apple CarPlay as standard, though, and Android Auto isn’t even available. While there’s plenty of space for adults around those sports seats, rear seat space isn’t quite so good. Legroom is generous, but the BMW X4 M’s raked roofline means that anybody over six foot tall will find headroom tight – something the boxier X3 M doesn’t suffer. Of course, kids will be fine, but the rear windows are also quite shallow so they may feel claustrophobic. The X4’s boot, too, is only 50-litres smaller than the X3’s, but is a shallower, more awkward space. However, the X4 M gives nothing away to the X3 M on the engine front: both are fitted with BMW’s savage twin-turbocharged 3.0-litre straight-six petrol which develops 510hp. Via a brilliant standard eight-speed automatic gearbox and clever all-wheel-drive system , that means an official 0-62mph time of just 4.1 seconds, which is officially slower than a Mercedes-AMG GLC 63 S Coupe – although we managed under four seconds when we tried it ourselves. The X4 M is also every bit as great as the Mercedes at going around corners for such a big SUV . Thanks to that clever all-wheel-drive system, a trick rear differential that distributes power to the rear wheel with the most grip, a stiffened body and stiffer suspension, it turns into corners keenly and remains composed throughout. It’ll even break traction and get playful if you want to explore its limits further. It’s no BMW M4 in the bends, but it isn’t far off. The BMW X4 M Competition’s biggest problem? The BMW X3 M Competition. The X3 is just as high quality inside, as fast and agile, but cheaper to buy and more spacious and practical, making it a better choice for more people.

This is the BMW M240i, and it’s a bit like one of those ‘lite’ diet desserts. You know, the ones that promise most of the taste but without all the calories. Only for once, this ‘lite’ option really delivers. For three-quarters of the price of the utterly bonkers BMW M2 , you get 90% of the car. In fact it’s so good, it makes us wonder if anyone really needs the M2. The M240i is not just a more affordable alternative to its big brother. It's a performance-oriented coupe that rivals the Mercedes-AMG CLA 35 and Audi S3 Saloon . You could also see it as an alternative to an Audi TT or entry-level Porsche Cayman , and it picked up a 2023 carwow Buy It Award . To look at, the M240i doesn’t have the drama of some of these cars. The design doesn’t deviate hugely from M Sport versions of the regular BMW 2 Series Coupe, but there are some touches to add aggression to the M240i. Though the design doesn’t deviate hugely from M Sport versions of the regular BMW 2 Series Coupe , there are some touches to add aggression to the M240i. These changes are most obvious at the rear, with the inclusion of a new lip spoiler and a rear diffuser, plus larger exhaust surrounds. You’ll get larger intakes at the front of the car too, along with new door mirrors and 19-inch alloy wheels as standard. Similarly inside, rather than going overboard with changes to the interior, there’s a handful of tweaks to nod to the performance credentials of the M240i. The main one is a really comfy set of leather sports seats, plus some M-branded stitching in various places. Retained from the base car is BMW’s sleek iDrive infotainment system. Though it’s not the latest version as seen in the BMW iX or 7 Series , it’s still slick to use and looks fantastic. Plus, if you’d rather mirror your phone, there’s support for Android Auto and Apple CarPlay . Though there are rear seats in the BMW M240i, they’re not exactly spacious – though that’s the natural territory of a small coupe. Headroom is pretty tight because of the sloped roofline, and legroom is at a premium. An Audi S3 or Mercedes -AMG CLA 35 would serve you better if you need to carry passengers. Boot space is unchanged from the base car, coming in at 390 litres. That’s some way down on the Mercedes-AMG CLA 35’s 460 litres, and the Audi S3 Saloon’s 425 litres. The thing you’re likely most interested in is the engine powering the BMW M240i. It’s a 3.0-litre turbocharged six-cylinder, producing 374hp and 500Nm. That’s sent to an all-wheel-drive system through an eight-speed automatic gearbox, resulting in a 0-60mph time of 4.3 seconds. There’s no manual option here, sorry. Along with that beefy engine, the M240i also comes with upgraded brakes, a limited-slip differential on the rear axle and wider tyres for more grip. You can also get an excellent adaptive damper system, but it’s pricey as it’s not a standard inclusion. If you’re buying a BMW M240i, you’ve likely done so to have some fun on twisty roads. It’s a delight to report it’s rather good at that. Steering feels really precise and there’s plenty of grip, leaving you with a lot of confidence to push. You can feel the car move around a bit underneath you, but there’s never a lack of composure. Certainly an improvement over the old M240i. That capability doesn’t come at a cost when it comes to daily driving. It’s comfy and quiet when you’re at a cruise, and it’s effortless to manoeuvre around. The only real sticking point of the BMW M240i is its price. It starts around £4,000 more than a CLA 35, and £6,000 more than an Audi S3 Saloon. Plus, it’s in entry-level Porsche Cayman territory - which is hard to look beyond if you’re looking for an all-out sports car. If you’re willing to stomach the cost though, the BMW M240i is a car you should go right ahead and buy. It’s absolutely brilliant.

Alternatively, have a browse of the latest used BMW stock , and when you've found your next set of wheels, use Carwow to sell your car online . How much is the BMW M240i How much is the BMW M240i The M240i really is a very pricey coupe, so if you are willing to trade a little performance you might want to think about an M135i instead. That’s a hot hatch rather than a coupe and the four-cylinder engine doesn’t sound as good as the M240i’s six, but it’s a lot more practical than the M240i as well as cheaper. Then again, the M240i is better value than the M2. Yes, the M2 is a proper M car and yes, it’s even faster than the M240i. But unless you risk your licence every time you get behind the wheel the M240i delivers all the performance you really need and more, plus four-wheel drive makes the power easier to use in wet weather – the M2 is rear-wheel drive. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort Quick and easy to live with, but we can’t be the only ones who miss a manual gearbox One of the things we really like about the M240i is how it can play different roles, depending on what the driver needs. It’s not one of those performance cars that’s so narrowly focused that it’s a pain to live with every day. You can drive the daily commute or school run without being frustrated by an aggressive throttle or a rock-hard ride. The standard setup is fine, but it’s worth paying the extra for the clever adaptive dampers and putting them in ‘comfort’ mode. The view over your shoulder isn’t brilliant, but fortunately front and rear parking sensors are standard. The Technology Plus Pack includes a 360-degree camera system to make life easier still. It’s not a very big coupe, so it will fit in smaller spaces than a BMW 4 Series . There’s only one engine option, and frankly it’s overkill for city driving. The six-cylinder petrol deserves better than to be stuck in town. But it pulls strongly from low revs and the eight-speed auto changes smoothly, so making comfortable progress in stop-start traffic is straightforward. Give the M240i a chance to stretch its legs on the motorway, and you’ll be struck by the breadth of the BMW’s talents. It’s not harsh or loud, in fact this junior M-car is almost as quiet at 70mph as a regular 2 Series Coupe. You won’t be stuck behind a queue of lorries for long, thanks to epic acceleration. And the M240i is super-stable at speed – it’s only beginning to flex its muscles at the UK motorway limit. Cruise control is standard, and you can upgrade to adaptive cruise control that will accelerate and brake to hold a set distance from the car in front. Now we’re talking. This is what the M240i is all about. The engine is the star turn. Six-cylinder petrols like this one are a dying breed in the quest for greater efficiency and lower emissions, so enjoy this wonderful engine while you still can. The performance and the sound (even though it’s partly played through the speakers) never fail to make you want to take the long way home. We’d love to try it with a manual gearbox, but the M240i is only offered with an auto. The M240i handles better than the 4 Series Coupe, and the ride on adaptive dampers does a superb job of dealing with bumps. It handles like a BMW should without rattling the spare change from your pocket on a bumpy road. The four-wheel-drive system delivers a rear-wheel-drive handling balance in the dry, but without any unwanted tail-happy moments if the road is wet. The M2 is amazing, but most drivers most of the time will be just as happy with the M240i. Space and practicality Space and practicality Great if you’re in the front, but very cramped in the back You sit low in the M240i, leaving you in no doubt that this is a sporty car. The sports seats – an upgrade over those in slower versions of the 2 Series Coupe – are very comfortable and supportive. Short and tall alike should be able to get comfortable behind the wheel, despite the pedals being ever so slightly offset. The seat adjusts electrically, and lumbar adjustment is standard for the driver, to the relief of any back-pain sufferer. An electric glass sunroof is an option. It will steal a little headroom, so think carefully before ticking this box if you are tall. There’s a reasonable amount of storage in the front of the cabin. The glovebox is big enough to be useful for more than, well, gloves, and the door bins are a healthy size. There’s more storage under the armrest. As you’d expect, you get two cupholders. All told, the M240i is much like the larger 4 Series Coupe if you are travelling in the front. The space and the practicality on offer are all broadly the same. Which is more than you can say for the back… It’s a tight squeeze in the rear of the M240i. Being a coupe, you have to clamber past a folded front seat, and once you reach the back of the cabin your reward is a pretty dark and cramped environment, although it’s good to see air vents between the front seats. The larger 4 Series offers much more space if you are going to make regular use of the back seats. On the other hand, the 2 Series is less claustrophobic than the rear of an Audi TT Coupe. You only have two seatbelts in the back, so the M240i is a four-seater. You should be able to squeeze a set of golf clubs in the back of the M240i. The capacity is 390 litres, which is more than respectable for a small coupe. There are just 305 litres in an Audi TT for example. Being a saloon, the M240i’s boot opening is quite small, so you won’t fit something really bulky through the aperture. If you need the greater flexibility of a hatchback from your rapid BMW, take a look at the M135i hatchback instead. Despite having a slightly smaller total size than the 2 Series, it’s a much more practical car than the M240i, although it can’t match the coupe for driving thrills. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories A bit too similar to the standard 2 Series Coupe, but stylish even so The inside of the M240i is different to the cabin of a common or garden 2 Series, but not that different. Maybe BMW could have done more to make the M240i feel more special and distinct from the rest of the range. The most important change is that the regular front seats have been replaced with much sportier chairs. They’re upholstered in leather and heavily bolstered so you won’t go sliding around while having fun on a twisty B-road. Other touches include blue stitching on the seats, and BMW’s M colours of blue, red and violet stitched into the seatbelts. Although not massively different from a more affordable 2 Series, there are worse places to spend your time than the cabin of the M240i. The design is attractive, although not as modern as the inside of the BMW i4 with its larger twin-screen display. But it is very sporty looking, and build quality is excellent. Some alternatives to the M240i have more dramatic looking interiors, such as the Mercedes-AMG CLA 35, but none are more solidly screwed together or made from nicer materials. You don’t get the latest generation of iDrive infotainment in the 2 Series, but although that sounds like a bad thing, ease of use took a step backwards with the latest version. In the M240i, for example, you still get separate physical controls for the air conditioning. It’s much easier to reach for a physical dial than to hit the right part of a touchscreen without taking your eyes from the road. The infotainment screen measures 10.3 inches, and you can either press icons on the screen or use the iDrive rotary controller and shortcut buttons to navigate through the various menus. We’d use the controller – it’s one reason why BMW’s infotainment is so easy to use. There’s a digital display straight ahead of you in place of conventional dials. The graphics are a bit dark but it tells you what you need to know. MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax There’s only one engine and gearbox combination, so we won’t need to keep you too long to run through its fuel economy and emissions. The car returned 32.1-34.4mpg in official tests and has a figure of 185-200g/km of carbon dioxide. So, while it’s no eco champion, it’s relatively efficient for a car with such vivid performance. Just don’t be surprised if you don’t match those figures whenever you enjoy all 374hp to the full. The first year’s Vehicle Excise Duty is included in the on-the-road charges, but from the car’s first birthday you’ll need to find the higher rate of VED for five years. That’s because the M240i costs well over £40,000, and all cars costing more than this figure attract a surcharge per year on top of the standard fee. If you can persuade your fleet manager to let you run an M240i as a company car then, well, we’re very jealous. But just keep in mind that you’ll be paying benefit-in-kind tax at the top rate of 37%. An electric car or a plug-in hybrid will keep more money in your pay packet, although you won’t have nearly as much fun. Safety and security Safety and security BMW routinely scores five stars out of five in Euro NCAP safety tests, but the 2 Series Coupe is an exception: it only earned four stars. That’s disappointing rather than disastrous. The BMW still scored 82% for adult occupant protection, 81% for child occupants, 67% for protecting vulnerable road users and 64% for its safety assistance systems. The Technology Plus Pack adds a camera that will record the location and speed of any collision, which could come in handy if you need to prove you were not at fault. The M Technology Pack adds uprated brakes, while the Driving Assistant pack includes extra clever tech to help the driver avoid any mishap. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems BMW’s standing in reliability and owner satisfaction surveys can be a bit up and down. However, it does vary quite a bit from model to model. It’s a bit early to be sure how the current 2 Series is going to fare, but the previous generation was one of BMW’s more reliable models. If you do run into problems with your M240i, BMW offers a three-year unlimited mileage warranty. That’s slightly more generous than the three-year, 60,000-mile package Audi supplies with the S3."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/m240i-convertible,BMW M240i Convertible Review and Prices,"€51,424",7/10,new,"The BMW M240i Convertible is a drop-top version of the sporty M240i Coupe which is worth considering if you’re looking for something small, fast and fun but don’t like the sound of an Audi TT Roadster or a Porsche 718 Cayman. Sure, the fairly unassuming BMW M240i Convertible doesn’t look quite as dramatic as these long-slung sports cars, but it comes with plenty of sporty features to help you tell it apart from the standard 2 Series Convertible. The front and rear bumpers are lower and more aggressive, you get some bigger alloy wheels and at the back, you’ll find a pair of larger exhaust pipes. Step inside, and the BMW M240i Convertible doesn’t feel quite so special. Sure, everything feels just as well put together as in the super solid 2 Series, but it doesn’t look as sporty as the cabins in either the Audi TT Roadster or Porsche 718 Cayman and the higher seating position means you don’t feel quite so cocooned inside. You do get plenty of equipment as standard though – including BMW’s excellent iDrive infotainment system with built-in satellite navigation – but you can’t get a digital driver’s display like in the TT Roadster which is a shame. You do get a decent amount of seat adjustment as standard, though, and the BMW M240i Convertible comes with more supportive leather-trimmed sports seats than the standard 2 Series. Predictably, space in the back seats is no better than the standard car – two kids will have just enough space to get comfy but adults will feel pretty claustrophobic, especially with the roof up. The BMW M240i Convertible is a more usable alternative to the likes of the two-seat Porsche 718 Cayman with a superb six-cylinder engine and a plush interior. Having said that, the TT Roadster is even tighter in the back and the 718 Cayman doesn’t have any back seats at all. All three cars have similar-sized boots, though, so you can carry a few suitcases whether the roof is up or down. Speaking of putting the roof down, the BMW M240i Convertible makes a great countryside cruiser. Its 340hp six-cylinder engine is smooth, sounds lovely and has enough poke to blast you from 0-62mph in five seconds flat. The standard manual gearbox is lovely and precise, but if you spend a lot of time in town you’ll want to get the optional automatic instead. It doesn’t just make the BMW M240i Convertible easier to drive, it also makes it slightly more economical. The standard suspension does a good job ironing out bumps around town and stopping the BMW M240i Convertible’s body leaning in tight corners, but the optional Adaptive M Sport Dampers make it better still. This system lets you choose between softer settings for long motorway journeys and firmer setups to make the car feel more agile on twisty roads – effectively letting you have your cake and eat it. Even with its upgraded suspension turned up to 11 though, the BMW M240i Convertible doesn’t feel quite as sharp as the Porsche 718 Cayman. But, it’s still huge fun to drive and will be easier to live with every day."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/x1,BMW X1 Review & Prices,"€53,410",8/10,new,"Is the BMW X1 a good car? Is the BMW X1 a good car? The BMW X1 is the baby of the Bavarian brand’s SUV range, headed by the enormous X7 seven-seater . It may still be the entry level SUV model, but the current model is far removed from the awkward-looking compact SUV-inspired hatchback the X1 once was. Think of it as the youngest sibling in a large family. It’ll always be seen as the little one, but now it’s grown out of puberty, graduated university and it should be taken seriously. And the X1 really has grown, not just in character but in size being larger in every direction than the model that came before it. It’s a much better looking car now, with a bluff front end sporting a pair of squared-off grilles and aggressive headlights. It’s a boxy car all round, looking even larger than it is with sharp angles and crisp lines all over - especially in M Sport trim, whereas xLine cars ditch the aggressive body kit in favour of tough looking black cladding. The interior of the X1 is sleeker than the exterior, with a pared-down dashboard featuring a prominent pair of screens in a single wide display. They’re crisp and easy to read, but the infotainment menus can be a little overwhelming to use. BMW has opted to get rid of physical climate control buttons and use touch controls on the 10.7-inch screen instead, but it’s rather fiddly to use on the move. Otherwise the cabin layout is easy to navigate and pleasant on the eye, with minimalistic shapes and contrasting trims across the width of the dashboard to break up the design. Gone is the traditional gear level, with a tiny gear selector switch in its place instead. Space is good in both the front and back of the X1, especially with the sliding reach bench set all the way back. Tall adults won’t struggle for headroom and legroom at any position, though boot space is maximised with the bench all the way forwards. The X1 beats its German alternatives for boot space, at 540 litres versus the Audi Q3 ’s 530 litres and the Mercedes GLA ’s 495 litres - though the Volvo XC40 has the X1 licked with its 578-litre boot. BMW has given its small SUV a wide range of engine options, with the cheapest being the entry-level petrol model. There are fuel efficient plug-in hybrid options and a range-topping M35i high-performance model. All X1 models are good fun on a twisty road, but being a BMW it’s hardly a surprise. There’s little in the way of body lean when attacking corners and the steering isn’t too light for decent grip feel. It’s definitely sportier than alternatives such as the VW T-Roc and Skoda Kamiq . The M35i model is a cut above, but that’s to be expected with its BMW M135i roots. Motorways are a little noisier than you might expect from a posh SUV with some noticeable wind and road noise - especially on the larger optional wheels. In town the X1 can get shaken up over broken roads, but good all-round visibility, automatic gearboxes and a small turning circle make city driving a breeze. The X1 should be at the top of your list for a premium small family SUV, and you can check out Carwow’s BMW X1 deals here. If you know you want a BMW but you're not sure on the X1, have a look at other new BMW deals instead. You could also browse used X1s or other used BMW deals too. Carwow can even help you sell your car when the time comes. How much is the BMW X1? How much is the BMW X1? The BMW X1 starts at a touch more than the Audi Q3 and Mercedes GLA’s base prices, though the X1 is a more practical car than either of them. Sport-spec cars come with cloth seats as standard, as well as front heated seats and gloss black exterior trim. There’s the electric iX1 available too, but it’s noticeably more expensive than the petrol and diesel models. You get 19-inch wheels as standard on the top-of the range Shadow Edition trim, with adaptive LED headlights, front sports seats and adaptive ‘M’ suspension and brakes as well as the M body kit. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort The X1 is a good all-rounder, being both comfy in town and on longer drives, but the steering doesn’t give a lot of feel The X1, being the most compact BMW SUV, is pretty easy to use around town. It doesn’t feel too large on smaller streets, even though it has grown compared to the previous generation. You get light steering to help with manoeuvring, but the turning circle of 11.7m is down on the Volvo XC40 and Mercedes GLA (11.4m). It’s still more than good enough though. Despite the large A-pillars blocking some of the view out front, you still get decent all-round visibility – the large wing mirrors and rear window helping out especially. Suspension is a touch firm, and when you add 20-inch wheels into that, it could even be considered too firm. But on the whole, bumps are rounded off nicely and you can make smooth progress. You can only get the X1 with an automatic transmission, but it’s a good one so you don’t have any worries with that, and the engines are smooth – the 23i helping with punchiness out of junctions. If you go for the 25e and 30e plug-in hybrids , you can cruise around on electric power alone for over 50 miles on both, while the punchier 23d diesel will give you decent acceleration away from junctions and lights. The 20i petrol and 18d diesel are more than good enough around town as well, but won’t be as quick at accelerating. The sporty M35i model packs the most punch thanks to its high-performance engine, but it's much less comfortable over bumps due to its stiffer suspension. Apart from some engine noise that’s a bit loud when you’re accelerating, motorway driving in the X1 is very simple. With the 23i, you get up to speed swiftly – even if the auto box is a touch laggy – and that helps a lot getting on at junctions. When cruising, the X1 is good, although there can be some wind noise, and larger wheels do mean you get some tyre roar as well. You get cruise control as standard to help make long distance driving easier, but you will have to add a rather expensive pack for the pleasure of adaptive cruise control . Annoyingly for that as well, distance control is very fiddly to adjust. By no means is the X1 a sporty car, but it handles really nicely. The steering is direct and you can place it easily – it’s just a shame that you get little-to-no feel for grip from the front wheels. The M35i stands out on a twisty road, and it's very capable when carving through corners with lots of grip and heavier steering. It's not as fun as VW Golf R for example, but feels almost as rapid. Body control is good when you put it into sport mode, and even in the normal comfort setting the X1 doesn’t lean too much. Sport mode does also improve engine responsiveness and steering weight – both of which enhance the driving experience. You also get fake engine noises piped into the cabin, although that’s a bit of a gimmick in our eyes. Space and practicality Space and practicality There aren’t many things wrong with the X1, but the boot is a little underwhelming with either mild hybrid or plug-in hybrid involved Compared to its alternatives, the X1 has a good deal of storage space up front, with plenty either side in the large door bins, and under the floating centre console. Although only an option, the wireless charging pad sitting below the infotainment screens is also quite useful, while you get two well-sized cup holders. As with most BMW models, you can get comfortable really easily. The electrical seat controls that are part of the comfort pack give you lots of adjustment, while the steering wheel has reach and angle alteration. The rather chunky steering wheel of the M Sport model can block some of the driver’s display though. As with some other small SUVs, you can slide the rear bench to give you either more legroom or boot space – with 130mm of variation. Even with the seat in its front-most position, you get just enough knee room for an adult, while headroom is consistently good wherever the seats are. You also get some reclination to help you relax on longer drives. As with the front, you get deep door bins in the back seats – although they aren’t as long – plus nets on the back of the seats, even the sportier M Sport ones. You get two USB-C charging ports to keep your devices topped up too. Compared to its alternatives, the maximum boot space of 550 litres is very good. Only the Volvo XC40 bests it with 578 litres, but the Audi Q3 (530 litres) and Mercedes GLA (495 litres) do lag behind. Having the mild-hybrid models – likely to be the most popular ones – reduces it to 500 litres, while going for the PHEV drops storage by a further 10 litres. The shape is really useful with a large opening, while the load lip is level with the floor to make loading and unloading really simple. You get some nets, little bins either side and a 12V socket, but no way to fold the seats down from the rear. Annoyingly you need to go round to the seat bases and pull a cloth handle. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories The professional look and excellent build quality is classic BMW, but it could be described as a little dull The cabins of most BMW models are of a high quality, and the X1 continues that trend. You get soft-touch surfaces for all the major touch points, and smooth leatherette or leather on the steering wheel. You will find some scratchier plastics lower down around your legs though. You also get that choice for the seating, with either the sport or optional comfort seats fitted – while the dashboard can be trimmed in piano black plastic, aluminium effect or wood to change the interior feel. The look of the cabin is pleasing on the whole, with nice lines and a simple-to-navigate layout. It’s not the most exciting design, but it’s modern and streamlined. In some regards it’s too streamlined, as you don’t get conventional climate control buttons and the driving settings are now buried in menus on the touchscreen, which can be very fiddly to control when you’re on the go. As the centrepiece of the cabin, the panel on the dashboard holds the two large displays – a 10.7-inch infotainment touchscreen and a 10.25-inch driver’s display. Both are clear and simple enough to navigate, and you can alter the design of the instrument display to show what you need. You can also configure the infotainment screen, where you can drag and drop the different tiles to make a layout to suit you. The system can be a little laggy though, so you may be better off using Apple CarPlay or Android Auto – which can show their navigation apps in the driver’s display if you so choose. There are some options to choose from, including the comfort pack, a Harmon Kardon sound system and the Driving Assistant pack – although you also need to also tick the box for the Technology pack to even have that included. MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax The X1 has the choice of petrol, diesel or plug-in hybrid petrol – all of which have their own merits. For those wanting to get decent tax breaks and spend a lot of time in town, one of the PHEVs – the 25e and 30e – is a good choice, while the petrols – 20i and 23i – are better for shorter stints but are still great over long distances for efficiency. The diesels – 18d and 23d – are definitely for those doing longer journeys consistently. Both the PHEVs come with a 1.5-litre three-cylinder petrol engine and an electric motor. The 25e has 245hp, while the 30e has 326hp. Both get over 50 miles of electric range and emissions of 20g/km CO2 or below. Official fuel efficiency is also at over 300mpg for both models, though you’re unlikely to see anything near that unless you charge the electrical system regularly. When comparing similarly powered diesels to the petrol options, you get around 10mpg of advantage. The diesels come with figures in the mid 50s, while the petrol engines range from the low to mid 40s for efficiency, and the diesel is only £1,000 more than the comparatively powered petrol option. Emissions do also lean in the favour of the diesel engines, but the lower-powered versions of both are quite close. The higher-powered petrol emits significantly more CO2, but has the performance edge. As mentioned earlier, the PHEV models will likely get you favourable tax breaks if you get one as a company car. But otherwise, the least expensive PHEV starts from more than £40,000, so you’ll need to pay more road tax as a result – even if the emissions are well down compared to the petrol and diesel models. Safety and security Safety and security Through the stringent Euro NCAP testing process, the X1 scored five stars. It scored well in safety assist (92%), child occupant (89%) and adult occupant (86%), while the vulnerable road user level was a little down (75%). As standard, the X1 gets parking sensors with a reversing camera, attentiveness assist, BMW’s active guard emergency braking system and cruise control, while you can add further assistance systems. You can only add those if you choose the Technology Pack though. You also get ISOFIX points – with one on the front passenger seat and two on the back row – alongside all-round airbags and alarm system. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems The previous version of the X1 suffered from many issues, which puts BMW’s reputation as one of the most reliable brands out there into question. We’ll have to see if this latest X1 suffers from the same fate. With each new BMW you get a three-year/unlimited mileage warranty, and as you can get the X1 as a PHEV, you can get a specific warranty for the battery too. The plug-in also gets a better warranty than the petrol and diesel cars, up to 74,500 miles, up to a maximum of eight years. BMW X1 FAQs BMW X1 FAQs"

The BMW 8 Series Convertible is the solution to a problem that’s nice to have: how to blast from the UK to the south of France quickly but comfortably, enjoy an Alpine pass along the way, but also bask in the warm Mediterranean sun upon arrival. If that’s what you woke up worrying about this morning, BMW has your answer. But it isn’t necessarily the only answer. There are other luxurious open-top GT cars that’ll scythe their way to Saint Tropez with similar speed and grace. The best of those include the Bentley Continental GT Convertible and Mercedes S-Class Cabriolet . And it’s fair to say the 8 Series doesn’t have quite the presence of those cars. It’s hardly a shrinking violet with its prominent grille and steeply raked windscreen, but you’d wager the Bentley and Mercedes will turn more heads. It’s the same inside – the 8 Series’ cabin is slick and high quality, but it lacks the sheer pizzazz of its rivals. It has a better infotainment system , though. The most advanced version of BMW’s fantastic iDrive comes as standard and includes a 10-inch screen which can be controlled via a rotary dial between the front seats, physical touch or using your voice. It’ll also respond to hand gestures and comes with a handy Personal Assistant feature that’ll do everything from adjust the climate control to find your favourite restaurant. All you need to do is say ‘hey BMW’ and ask the question. Where the 8 Series Convertible is less adept is with space. Not in the front, mind, where the driver gets a huge amount of electric seat and wheel adjustment and both front passengers enjoy superbly supportive sports seats. No, it’s the back seats which are the issue – anybody with legs will seriously struggle to stay comfortable on even short journeys. Sure, the Bentley and Mercedes are hardly MPVs , but they do offer slightly more rear space. At least the 8 Series’ boot is on a par with the Bentley and Mercedes at 350 litres, although that’s with its fabric roof up. With it down (which takes just 15 seconds up to 31mph) some of that space is robbed to store it. So, where a large suitcase plus some soft bags will fit on a rainy day, you’ll have to rethink your outfits if you want the wind in your hair. And you will, especially if you go for the 530hp M850i petrol which sounds superb with its sports exhaust when testing its staggering 3.2 second 0-62mph sprint time. The only other engine option is a 333hp 840i, which is a touch less engaging. It’s still fast though (0-62mph arrives in 5.5 seconds) and will use less fuel. Open top cars (especially big ones like the 8 Series) are usually noticeably less rigid to drive than cars with roofs, because quite literally there’s nothing solid connecting them up top. This normally results in some shuddering through the body over bumps, but not here, because you’d struggle to tell any difference in comfort at low speeds around town. And the same goes on a country road, where the Convertible’s standard all-wheel drive and rear wheel steering help it feel just as agile as the 8 Series Coupe. Particularly the M850i, where BMW’s M division has been involved in its suspension, plus it gets a clever differential for better distribution of power to the road. Then, when you aren’t in the mood, roof-closed the 8 Series Convertible remains quiet on the motorway too, making it a thoroughly well-rounded car. It’s high-quality, has great tech, is relaxing to drive but also fun when you want it to be. It even looks good value next to the Bentley and Mercedes. That is, of course, relatively speaking. Indeed, the 8 Series Convertible certainly requires deep pockets (even deeper if you go for the petrol version) and there are more spacious open-top GT cars, but if you have the budget and don’t need the space, the 8 Series Convertible makes a superb open-top GT.

https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/3-series-gran-turismo,BMW 3 Series Gran Turismo Review and Prices,"€48,181",7/10,new,"The BMW 3 Series Gran Turismo is a larger, more practical version of the 3 Series saloon that comes with more passenger space in the back and a bigger boot. It’s an alternative to the likes of the Audi A5 Sportback and the smaller Mercedes CLA Shooting Brake. Step inside, and you’ll find the BMW 3 Series Gran Turismo’s interior looks pretty much identical to what you get in the standard 3 Series. There’s a similar broad dashboard with intuitive heating and ventilation controls and a free-standing infotainment display. Everything feels just as well built and plush, but it still trails the bulletproof Audi A5 Sportback for outright fit and finish. In terms of practicality, the BMW 3 Series Gran Turismo edges ahead, however. There’s just as much head and legroom in the front seats as you get in the standard 3 Series saloon but the 3 Series Gran Turismo’s longer body means your passengers get to enjoy slightly more legroom in the back. Unfortunately, try to carry three adults side-by-side, and you’ll hear nothing but complaints from your passenger in the middle seat – a large lump in the floor leaves them nowhere to put their feet. That said, they’ll still have more space to stretch out than in the Audi A5 Sportback and the BMW 3 Series Gran Turismo comes with a bigger boot, too. There’s space for a few large suitcases or a set of golf clubs with the back seats up and – with them folded down – a bike will fit with both wheels attached. The BMW 3 Series Gran Turismo’s back end looks a little like a 3 Series Touring that’s been sat on by an elephant. Despite this, it’s still impressively practical Don’t think all this luggage space means the BMW 3 Series Gran Turismo drives like a boxy SUV – it’s noticeably more nimble than the Audi A5 Sportback on a twisty country road. It doesn’t feel quite as agile as the lighter, shorter 3 Series saloon, but with the optional adaptive suspension fitted it does a fine job for such a roomy car. Driving the BMW 3 Series Gran Turismo is fairly relaxing, too. It’s quiet and comfortable at motorway speeds, and the light steering means it isn’t at all strenuous to drive around town. It’s not all good news, however – it’s not quite as easy to manoeuvre as the smaller 3 Series saloon and you’ll have to pay extra for parking sensors and a reversing camera. There are plenty of engines to choose from – including frugal diesels best suited to long motorway journeys and a range of petrols, including a seriously rapid 340i model. Sadly, you’ll have to pay extra for plenty of driver assistance systems – even automatic emergency braking costs extra across the range. If you’re happy to pay extra for a few desirable options, then the BMW 3 Series Gran Turismo makes a very comfortable, very upmarket five-seater. You’ll just have to decide whether the extra space is worth the premium over the standard 3 Series saloon and estate…"
https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/i3,BMW i3 Review and Prices,"€45,484",8/10,new,"The BMW i3 is well worth considering if you’re looking for an electric car that’s easy to drive around town and has a stylish, upmarket interior. But like an iPad next to a white-label Android tablet, you’ll pay more for the i3’s sharp looks and quality than you will for its more ordinary alternatives. Inside the i3 you get BMW’s brilliant iDrive with high-resolution 10-inch infotainment screen and sat nav as standard, but unfortunately, BMW’s wooden dashboard trims and partial leather seats aren’t – they’re only available as part of BMW’s optional Loft, Lodge and Suite interior trim packages. But even without one of these upgraded packs, the i3’s cabin still looks plush and there’s plenty of space for you to get comfortable – even if you’re more than six-foot tall. Sadly, space in the back isn’t quite as generous but there’s still enough space for kids to stretch out. The i3’s special rear-hinged back doors mean it’s easy to lift in a bulky child seat too, and its oddly shaped rear windows mean the back seats do at least feel impressively airy. Sadly, it’s a strict four-seater and its boot isn’t particularly spacious. As a result, both the Renault Zoe and Nissan Leaf are more practical electric cars. The BMW i3 comes as standard with a compact battery pack and a small electric motor driving the rear wheels. BMW claims this combination gives you a range of 188 miles between charges, but in real-world conditions, you can expect it to manage closer to 160 miles. The upmarket BMW i3 is a left-field choice in an already niche market, but look past its sci-fi styling and you’ll find it’s pretty easy to live with. There’s also an ‘s’ model which has more power but also a slightly reduced range – it’ll officially to go 175 miles between charges. However, BMW thinks that in the real world the i3s will also cover around 160 miles, matching the standard model. Don’t go thinking the i3’s a sluggish eco car only suited to plodding to the shops – the standard car’s 170hp electric motor delivers almost instant bursts of acceleration helping it sprint from 0-62mph in a thoroughly respectable 7.3 seconds. The i3s is even quicker, with its 184hp electric motor cutting that sprint time to 6.9 seconds. Whichever model you pick, you’ll find the BMW very easy to drive. It’s turning circle is very tight and its large windows make it easy to see out of and a breeze to park. Unfortunately, it isn’t quite as comfortable as the Zoe and Leaf. Its stiff suspension and large alloy wheels highlight bumps in the road and you’ll hear quite a lot of wind and tyre noise at motorway speeds. It can’t quite match the Zoe in terms of safety, either. It earned a four-star score from Euro NCAP in 2013 compared with the Renault’s five-star rating in the same year, and automatic emergency city braking is optional too. But if you can live with this compromise, the BMW’s a stylish small family car that’s worth considering if you mainly drive in town and have somewhere to charge it.

The BMW M8 Convertible is a soft-top version of the M8 Coupe that comes with an equally powerful 625hp engine and similarly sporty looks. To help you tell it apart from the standard 8 Series Convertible , you get more aggressive bumpers, larger exhausts, new alloy wheels and plenty of optional carbon fibre bits and pieces. Inside, you’ll find an even plusher interior than the standard BMW 8 Series Convertible with huge swathes of leather trim on the dashboard, doors and more supportive sports seats. Mostly unchanged from the standard car is the BMW M8 Convertible’s infotainment system that consists of a central touchscreen and a digital driver’s display. Under the bonnet, you’ll find a few more tweaks that all help the BMW M8 Convertible’s 4.4-litre turbocharged V8 engine produce 625hp. This power is transmitted to all four wheels through an automatic gearbox that helps this speed soft-top sprint from 0-60mph in less than four seconds. You can even set the four-wheel-drive system to send as much as 100% of the engine’s power to the rear wheels – just the thing if you fancy feeling not just the wind, but plenty of tyre smoke, in your hair on a race track.

https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/7-series,BMW 7 Series Review & Prices,"€146,201",8/10,new,"Is the BMW 7 Series a good car? Is the BMW 7 Series a good car? The BMW 7 Series is the flagship saloon of the German brand, and it showcases the latest tech that the firm has to offer. In this case, it’s got a fleet of improved technology inside, such as the optional cinema style screen in the back – like having your own private Odeon. But the main story with the 7 Series is its controversial new design. The large grille dominates the front, while it’s flanked by split headlights, which certainly divides opinion, but looks better in the metal. The sharp design continues down the side with some creases, but it’s slab-sided otherwise. At the rear it’s classic 7 Series with a modern twist. It’s pretty square but it gets thin lights to get that futuristic look. The all-electric BMW i7 that sits alongside the 7 Series gets blue highlights all round the vehicle, including on the rear bumper. Inside, you’ll find one of the fanciest cabins currently on sale. You get a huge panel containing both screens, one of which is the infotainment touchscreen that can be controlled by the iDrive dial. You also get loads of crystal detailing you may have seen in the BMW iX SUV, including a whole panel that lights up depending on different functions, such as the climate control. With luxury trimmings and excellent build quality, the 7 Series manages to be as accomplished as a Mercedes S-Class . It’s not quite as luxurious as the electric i7 though. The rear seats are like you’re on a business class flight, and you can get seats that recline to give a properly relaxing experience. You get touchscreen displays to control the optional widescreen that folds down from the roof, as well as the seats and air conditioning. It’s high-end limousine luxury at its finest. If you’re all about having a practical saloon, the 7 Series does okay with a 525-litre load area. The all-electric i7 gets slightly less with 500 litres. However, the Mercedes equivalents – the S-Class and EQS – get 550 litres and 610 litres respectively. And with the 7 Series and i7, you can’t fold the seats down to load longer items. Out on the road, the 7 Series feels super composed. Weighing north of two tonnes, it’s not light, but with the standard adaptive air suspension it rides smoothly and with little fuss. It disguises its weight well when going through the corners too. Around town, it is pretty long at 5.3m, but with the help of rear-wheel steering, it feels surprisingly manoeuvrable. There’s no hiding the fact that it’s a large car though, so thank goodness for the multiple cameras, making parking pretty simple. But where the 7 Series is peerless is cruising on the motorway. In the UK, we only get the 750e and M760e versions – both of which are plug-in hybrids offering up to 49 miles of electric driving. The electric punch matched with excellent engines should make overtaking and getting up to speed no problem. The BMW 7 Series is one of the best cars you can currently buy, and with its luxury appeal, it can definitely match the Mercedes S-Class in the premium limo market.

Do also check out our new BMW deals and used BMW cars for sale from our trusted dealer partners, and if you need to sell your car as well, Carwow can also help with that. How much is the BMW 7 Series? How much is the BMW 7 Series? The answer is… complicated. The most affordable plug-in hybrid version of the 7 Series, the 750e xDrive, is actually more expensive than the basic electric i7, and more than £20,000 pricier than the most affordable plug-in hybrid Audi A8 . Then again, the Audi is a much older design, and the BMW offers a much longer electric-only driving range, of up to 49 miles. Again, that has to be taken into consideration. There’s more complication when you compare the 750e to the Mercedes-Benz S-Class, not only because you’ll need to upgrade to the long-wheelbase version of the Mercedes to truly match the cabin space and comfort of the BMW. That pushes the price of the S-Class’ plug-in hybrid version quite a bit higher than that of the 750e, but once again electric-only range comes into play — the Mercedes has a bigger battery and a claimed electric range of up to 67 miles. It’s also worth remembering that the plug-in hybrid Range Rover , while not a direct competitor can be considered as a potential alternative, and offers 75 miles of electric only range. In this mix, the 7 Series sits more or less in the middle in terms of value — certainly pricier than the Audi , and slightly more affordable, model-for-model, than the equivalent S-Class. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort The 7 Series is a little noisier inside than is ideal, but Sport mode reveals it to be a proper BMW in the corners. The 7 Series is absolutely massive. Park it next to a ‘normal’ car in the street and it looks as if you’ve left an aircraft carrier tied up next to the kerb — especially with that tall grille and huge, flat bonnet. However, it’s not as bad when it comes to in-town manoeuvres as you might think. For a start, rear-wheel steering comes as standard on all 7 Series models, and that can help to shrink the turning circle a bit, but even then it’s still 12-metres around, which is about the same as you get in a Mercedes S-Class without rear-steering, while the older Audi A8 turns tighter still. There is a very good all-round camera system, which helps not just when parking but also when threading through traffic or getting in and out of narrow spaces. The optional Parking Assistant Pro system can not only park the 7 Series for you, but also can remember your regular parking manoeuvres (such as backing onto your driveway, or slipping into your — doubtless reserved — space at work) and can memorise manoeuvres of up to 200-metres in length (that’s 656 feet!). From the driving seat, all-round visibility is pretty good, and that big, flat bonnet does help you to judge the extremities of the car in town. Once you remember that the 7 Series really is very big, and you need to allow a bit of extra space, it’s actually not as bad as you might think in town. If there is an issue, it’s in the ride quality and comfort. The 7 Series comes with standard air suspension, which is great for comfort in general, but can allow small, sharp urban bumps to cause a jolt in the cabin. Once you’re up to cruising speed, the 7 Series is almost pillow-soft in its comfort levels, and is much more comfortable than, for example, the ageing Audi A8. However, it is a bit noisier than the Audi, allowing in more road noise, especially on coarse road surfaces. It’s hugely luxurious and comfortable by any rational standard, but at this kind of price level, small differences such as that can really add up. When you need to ask for acceleration, such as when merging or pulling out to overtake a line of lorries, the plug-in hybrid 750e and M760e both seem to need a moment to gather themselves before letting loose all their power. It’s almost like old-fashioned turbo lag, when you had to press the accelerator and then count… one… two… three… four… before the engine woke up properly. Once they do, the hybrid 7 Series are very quick indeed, especially (unsurprisingly) the M760e with its 563bhp, but the 483bhp 750e is hardly disgraced. The 7 Series might be big, might be luxurious, and might be heavy (2.5-tonnes…) but it’s still a BMW at heart, and that’s really noticeable when you get to a twisty road and select Sport mode. Annoyingly, this takes a while to do (you have to press the ‘My Modes’ button on the centre console, then pick Sport from the menu on the big screen, and then press a confirmation button to verify your choice — it’s all rather long-winded and distracting) but once you’ve done it, the 7 Series really tightens up and starts to feel properly sporty. There’s a much bigger and more obvious difference between Sport and Comfort modes in the BMW than there is in the Audi or Mercedes, and the 7 Series feels genuinely engaging to drive on an enjoyable road. That goes double for the M760e version, which feels like — and is — a proper rocket ship once you’ve engaged Sport mode. The only downfall is the steering, which even in Sport mode remains a bit too light for proper fun. This is still the getaway limo of choice, though, if that’s something you think you’ll ever need. Space and practicality Space and practicality There’s space and comfort aplenty in the front and back of the 7 Series, but while the boot is a good size, there are no folding rear seats for extra versatility. If there are cars with more comfortable front seats than those of a 7 Series… well, there certainly aren’t many. While cars such as these are often designed to be best-enjoyed from the back seats, the 7 Series remembers that drivers matter too, so there are those wonderful front seats, with multi-adjustable backrests and pillow-soft headrests. Space is excellent, and even though the centre console is massive, there’s not too much of a ‘hemmed-in’ feeling. Instead, you just feel cosy and protected. Under the butterfly-style armrest in between the front seats there’s a huge storage bin, and along the centre console you’ll find cup holders (which can be heated and cooled, as required) and a space for wirelessly charging your smartphone. Annoyingly, if you’ve got a tall bottle in the cupholders, actually reaching in and getting your phone out can be tricky, but then of course you’re not allowed to touch your phone while driving… The door bins are roomy, and the glovebox is a good size too. The 7 Series comes with only one wheelbase measurement (whereas Audi and Mercedes, and Range Rover for that matter, offer short and long versions) but the BMW’s space between the wheels is the same as that of the long-wheelbase Mercedes. Rear seat passengers, then, get simply enormous amounts of room and stretching legs or feet out is no problem at all. It’s a hugely expensive option, but it’s definitely worth specifying the optional rear reclining seats — the one behind the front-seat passenger actually fully reclines, like that of a first class airliner seat, and is astonishingly comfortable. There’s no real centre rear seat as such — just a small gap between the outer two seats, so while there is a seatbelt, the chunky rear centre armrest and general lack of width means that anyone stuck in the middle is not going to be very happy. That bulky armrest has cupholders and some storage space, and even a wireless phone charging pad (although, annoyingly, that has to be switched on via the screen in the front). Visibility out is good, through those long side windows, and if the car has the big glass roof, then it’s a very light and airy space in the back. It’s worth noting, for those who regularly travel in the back, that rear seat passengers will definitely notice that the 7 Series is more firm in its suspension than the Audi or Mercedes alternatives, but the upside of that is the BMW is less floaty and probably less likely to induce travel sickness. At 525-litres, the boot of the 7 Series isn’t exceptionally massive, but it is big, it is square, it has a relatively low loading lip, and there is some under-floor storage to stash your charging cables. The good news is that you get the same boot space whether you choose the plug-in hybrid 7 Series or fully-electric i7 — that stands in sharp contrast to the Audi A8, whose boot shrinks to just 390-litres in the plug-in hybrid model as the batteries take up so much space. Think that’s bad? Then try the plug-in hybrid Mercedes S580e, whose batteries shrink the boot to just 325-litres. For reference, a Volkswagen Golf hatchback has a 380-litre boot. The 7 Series does lose out to the all-electric Mercedes EQS, though, which can manage 610-litres and which has a handy fastback boot, which makes it more versatile. The BMW’s boot is also not perfect — the actual space left by the boot lid when it’s open is somewhat awkward, and there are no folding back seats to allow you to load in bigger items. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories Daring design and lots of high-tech, but some screen controls are more fiddly than they ought to be. BMW has been very daring with the cabin of the 7 Series. Compared to the beautifully-made, but rather tame-looking, cabins of the Mercedes or Audi, the 7 Series cabin is a positive riot. It starts with the crystal-style light panel (it’s actually called the ‘BMW Interaction Bar’) that runs the full width of the dashboard, and into the doors. Although this is actually made of plastic, it’s meant to look like the same crystal glass that is also used for the gear selector toggle and the electric seat adjusters. Tacky? A little bit, especially once you start playing with the more lurid ambient lighting colours, but at least BMW Is trying to do something different. The light bar also pulses and changes colours according to some in-car functions. It’ll turn blue if you’re turning the cabin temperature down, or flash red if you activate the hazard warning lights. On top of the dashboard is a huge, sweeping, curved screen which BMW now uses in almost all of its models. It looks like one big screen, but it’s actually two screens under a common cover, giving the driver a 12.3-inch instrument panel and putting a 14.9-inch infotainment screen in the middle. As with many car makers, BMW has done away with as many physical buttons as it can do, putting most of the controls onto the screen. That works OK up to a point. BMW’s software is reasonably easy to navigate your way around, and the screen is fast and responsive, but it’s never quite as easy to use as straightforward buttons would be (see the issues, above, with just doing something as simple as selecting Sport mode). At least you do still get the physical iDrive rotary controller on the centre console (it’s now made of crystal too) which makes it easier and safer to control the screen while driving. Depending on how you specify it, the 7 Series can be an utter technical riot. Rear seat passengers get little iPhone-style screens built into the doors which control the rear seat climate, door blinds and more and higher-spec models get an extra tablet, which slots into the centre armrest. The star of the show, though, is the optional rear widescreen television, which stashes away in the roof when you don’t want it, and which flips down to reveal a 31-inch screen with 8K high-definition and built-in internet connection, as well as a slot to allow you to connect an Amazon Fire Stick for streaming films and television. It’s an astonishing piece of in-car equipment, and is far more spectacular than the usual iPad-like screens stuck to the back of front seats that most rivals offer. There’s only one issue, and that’s that the big screen is so wide and so relatively close to your face that it can feel a bit like sitting in the front row of the cinema. Other than that, you get all the usual tech refinements including wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connections for your phone, and plenty of USB sockets including some mounted high up in the backs of the front seats, making them easier to find for those sitting in the back. Other options include a massively powerful Bowers + Wilkins stereo system (complete with genuine metal covers for the speakers) while the back seats can be fitted with ‘exciters’ that pulse and vibrate according to the music you’re listening to, or the film you’re watching. On a more serious note, the 7 Series has excellent build quality with a combination of expensive-looking and feeling plastics mixed with high-end leather, wood, and aluminium trim. The crystal buttons might look a bit nouveau riche, but there’s no doubting the solidity of the way the 7 Series is put together. MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax Thanks to coming only in plug-in hybrid or fully-electric forms, the 7 Series boasts some impressive emissions figures. Obviously, the electric versions are zero-emissions at the point of use, but thanks to their relatively big batteries, the plug-in hybrids have low emissions too — starting from as little as 23g/km for the 750e, rising to 27g/km for the more powerful M760e. The plug-ins are surprisingly economical, though. While the quoted electric range of up to 49 miles will be, realistically, more like 30-35 miles in real-world conditions, even the powerful M760e plug-in is capable of reaching almost 40mpg when cruising with a flat main battery, which is truly impressive. However, they will only charge at a maximum of 7.4kW on AC power, and can’t be fast-charged at all. Annual VED road tax for either of the hybrids is going to work out at £590.They’ll also only cost between £40 and £80 a month, or thereabouts, in Benefit in Kind company car tax , while the hybrids will cost between £140 and £160 per month. Safety and security Safety and security Neither the 7 Series nor the i7 have been independently crash-tested by Euro NCAP , but the large iX electric SUV has been, and that shares most of its structure with the 7 Series — the iX scored five-stars, and a 91 per cent adult occupant protection rating, so we would expect the 7 Series and i7 to perform in a broadly similar manner. As standard, all 7 Series and i7 models come with BMW’s ‘Active Protection’ system which not only monitors for driver distraction and fatigue, but also winds up the windows, pre-tensions the seatbelts, and automatically adjusts the seats to a more protective position if it detects that a crash is inevitable. Adaptive LED headlights with automatic high-beam, and the adaptive air suspension are also standard, as are an emergency e-call phone system, tyre pressure monitors, automatic wipers, lane keeping steering, rear cross traffic alert, and a system that warns you if you’re about to open a door into the face of an oncoming cyclist. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems The current 7 Series and i7 are still relatively new models, but so far no major reliability issues have been unearthed. The JD Power quality survey rates the 7 Series at 80 points out of 100, which isn’t perfect, but which is certainly impressive and speaks to the car’s high quality. There is no diesel-engined 7 Series anymore, so there are at least no concerns about the old BMW issue of snapped diesel engine timing chains, and the 3.0-litre turbo petrol unit used in the hybrids is a well-proven engine, which has already seen service in the previous 7 Series and 5 Series , as well as the 8 Series."

The BMW M8 Gran Coupe is a larger, more practical version of the M8 Coupe that comes with the same 625hp engine, but gets a more practical four-door body with a roomier boot and four seats. So, if you want an M car, but have too many friends, BMW has your back. Audi and Porsche have also got your back, though, because the Audi RS7 and Porsche Panamera also provide the same blend of coupe styling with two rows of seats and monumental performance. To help you tell it apart from the standard BMW 8 Series Gran Coupe , it gets more aggressive bumpers, four large exhaust pipes, new alloy wheels and plenty of optional carbon fibre details. Inside, you get lashings of leather trim on the doors, dashboard and seats, and the same brilliant iDrive Professional infotainment system and digital driver’s display as in the 8 Series. The Gran Coupe is quite a bit longer than the 8 Series Coupe and the widest car that BMW currently makes, so space inside for four adults is good. Those in that front can stretch out, while only the very tall will complain about headroom in the rear. The Gran Coupe’s large rear central console makes carrying a middle passenger difficult, mind. Its boot is smaller and more awkwardly shape than alternative efforts too. It doesn’t have great access, there’s a large lip to lift bags over and it has ridged sides that don’t make efficient use of the space. We fitted six carry-on cases inside, but a Panamera or RS7 will fit more. Under the BMW M8 Gran Coupe’s bonnet, you’ll find a 625hp version of the twin-turbo V8 in the M850i. This unit comes with plenty of parts shared with the BMW M5 Competition, including a grippy four-wheel-drive system that’ll blast the M8 Gran Coupe from 0-62mph in around three seconds. Performance isn’t a problem and neither is going around corners, because the M8 feels far more nimble than it should be given its size in its most aggressive drive modes. Even so, if you really value a pure driving experience, there are better (smaller) M cars on offer. The Gran Coupe also feels firm all of the time, which does get a little tiring and goes against its large luxury feel. But the main issue we have with the M8 Gran Coupe is that for a staggering wad of cash less, the M850i version provides 95% of the thrills with 100% of the luxury, not to mention a healthy dose more comfort too.

https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/3-series,BMW 3 Series Review & Prices,"€60,378",9/10,new,"Is the BMW 3 Series a good car? Is the BMW 3 Series a good car? The BMW 3 Series is like Alan Shearer. No, it’s not from Newcastle, but like Shearer it has for generations been a reliable and impressive performer, able to out-shine European and world opposition at the highest level, and is still going strong even in its advancing years. While Audi might be re-inventing the A4 as the new A5 (rather confusingly) and Mercedes has brought out a new C-Class while BMW was just updating the 3 Series, this is still a car that looks and feels totally cutting edge, especially in how it drives. Though if you would also consider an electric car , the Tesla Model 3 feels more futuristic still. In terms of styling, the most recent round of updates for the 3 Series haven’t changed that much. There’s been some small nipping and tucking around the lights and grille, some new wheels and paint options, but the overall shape and style remains the same. That’s both good and bad — good in that, overall, the 3 Series is still a handsome thing. Bad in that it hasn’t addressed some design mis-steps, such as the way the 3 looks overly bulky around the rear wheelarches. Basic Sport models get chrome trim around the radiator grille, while M-Sport models look a little more glowering with blacked-out trim. It’s in the cabin that you’ll find the bigger changes. BMW has binned the (rather attractive) separate digital instruments and infotainment screen in favour of the big, curved, combined screen setup taken from other models such as the 4 Series and 5 Series . This means that the 3 Series now has the latest and most up to date infotainment software — which can update itself via over-the-air links — but even though the old iDrive click-wheel has been retained, there are some fiddly bits to find your way around on the screens, and the graphics don’t look quite as nice as they used to. Space in the cabin remains unchanged, which means you get just enough for four adults to sit in reasonable comfort, but there’s not the stretch-out space you’d find elsewhere. The boot is practical, especially in the Touring estate, but remember that the plug-in hybrid 330e — a hugely popular model with business user-choosers — loses quite a lot of that space to the battery, to the point where a basic VW Golf hatchback has a bigger boot. Not that you’ll care about boot space much when you’re sitting up in the driver’s seat. The BMW 3 Series has long been considered the best of its breed to drive, and that hasn’t changed, despite the fact it’s bigger and heavier now than it has ever been. While we have to wait to see what Audi has cooked up with the new A5 saloon, the 3 Series most definitely has the beating of the otherwise-impressive Mercedes C-Class when it comes to the driving experience. The engine range has shrunk somewhat in the past few years — your choice at the base of the BMW 3 Series lineup is now restricted to the petrol 320i or the plug-in hybrid 330e. Bye-bye diesel 320d — we shall miss your combo of easy-going performance and exceptional economy, though there are plenty of excellent used examples to be found. In fact, there are now no diesel 3 Series models at all, something of a shock when you remember how wildly successful they have been over the years. Mind you, the 330e looks like it might be settling into the 320d’s economy shoes, not least because a big battery upgrade now means that it can do as much as 62 miles on electric power alone, if you remember to charge up the battery (which can’t, alas, be fast-charged from public DC chargers). Of course, if it’s serious performance you want — but you don’t fancy the expense and insurance cost of stepping up to a full-on M3 — there’s the brilliant M340i with its 374hp, straight-six, 3.0-litre turbo engine. Whisper it, but that’s actually a more enjoyable car to drive even than the mighty M3 itself. If you want to bag yourself a great deal, check out Carwow’s BMW 3 Series deals . You can also get a great price on a used 3 Series as well as other used BMWs from our network of trusted dealers. Carwow’s Sell My Car service takes the pain out of moving your old motor on, too. How much is the BMW 3 Series? How much is the BMW 3 Series? As with almost all new cars, the 3 Series has seen its prices creep up and up of late, but the most basic four-door saloon model, in 320i Sport guise, is still more affordable than Audi’s new sleek-looking A5 saloon, and it’s considerably more affordable than a Mercedes C200 saloon. A 330e plug-in hybrid is also a good bit less than a Mercedes C300e plug-in, but Audi hasn’t yet released prices for the A5 plug-in. You could shop outside the premium class for an alternative, and if you do, don't ignore the new Skoda Superb , which isn’t anywhere near as desirable as a 3 Series nor anything like as good to drive, but it’s huge inside, well-built, and a bargain compared to the Beemer. It’s also worth considering a Tesla Model 3 as an all-electric alternative. The Tesla’s quality isn’t as good as that of the BMW, but you can get a rear-drive Model 3 with a 318-mile range for slightly less than the price of a basic 320i. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort The 3 Series remains supreme to drive and improved refinement levels have lifted it up to Mercedes levels, but it can be a bit uncomfortable over bumps In Sport trim, the 3 Series’ suspension is quite soft, so it rides well around town. That said, bear in mind that M-Sport models come with stiffer, lower suspension so they can be a bit more uncomfortable, especially on urban roads. Still, you can spec your sportier 3 Series with adaptive suspension, which when set to Comfort mode, does cope well with bumps. Even with standard M-Sport springs and dampers, it has exceptionally good suspension control, so that it recovers quickly and smoothly after hitting a bump, so even though it’s a bit jiggly on a rough road, it never feels flustered. It’s worth remembering that the 330e plug-in hybrid gets slightly stiffer suspension again, as it has to be tightened up to cope with the extra weight of the battery and hybrid system, but of course the upside of that is that you can cover 62 miles on electric power alone, and probably more than that if you’re just driving around town. The turning circle is only average, though, and the 3 Series isn’t quite as nippy in town as, say, a Mercedes C-Class. The steering is lovely — weighty but not heavy — but the brakes can be a little snatchy until you get used to the pedal feel. The eight-speed automatic gearbox is absolutely fantastic, though. When parking, the standard front and rear sensors, and the rear-facing camera, make life easier, although visibility out is hindered by thick rear door pillars (less of a problem for the Touring estate). Optionally, you can have a very clever Active Parking Plus system that includes a 3D surround-camera system, and steering that parks the car for you. It can even learn, and repeat, regularly used manoeuvres such as how to reverse onto your own driveway. The 3 Series is truly at home on the motorway, and it’s really quite refined (although the four-cylinder diesels do get noisy when you really put your foot down). Acceleration from 50-70mph is especially impressive in the 320i, but much better in the 330e thanks to its electric motor, so BMW clearly knows what its customers want and need, although you need to give the eight-speed automatic gearbox a second or two to kick-down. Any 3 Series makes for a pretty effortless way to cover big miles, especially since BMW improved the car’s overall refinement, lifting it up to Mercedes levels. Stick your 3 Series into Sport mode and you’ll get meatier steering feel, sharper gearbox and throttle responses, and if you’ve got the adaptive suspension fitted, stiffer shock absorbers - which help to reduce body roll through faster corners even more. With standard rear-wheel drive, the 3 Series just feels so engaging and agile, with super-sharp steering that’s very precise. You always know exactly what the 3 Series is doing, and so it builds a huge amount of confidence on a twisty road. It is genuinely good fun to drive too — BMW has really nailed it with this 3 Series. In fact, it might just be the only car you ever need. For maximum thrills, get the 374hp M340i with its 3.0-litre straight-six engine, but to be honest even a humble 184hp 320i provides more fun than most other cars on the road. Space and practicality Space and practicality As far as saloon cars go, the 3 Series is about as practical as it gets. There’s enough space in the back, and a decent boot, though it could be more versatile There’s very good storage space in the front of the 3 Series’ cabin, starting with big door bins that have a separate section for holding a bottle of water. There’s a pair of decent cup holders, sensibly located next to the gear selector, and they’re not too deep so if you’ve got a small cup of coffee, it’s not going to disappear down into them. That gear selector is now a small toggle switch, instead of the old ‘big sticking up thumb’ gear lever that you got before. It doesn’t open up any more storage space, but it makes the cabin in general feel more open and spacious. Another small storage tray can be found in front of the cupholders, as well as a big lid that covers that whole section up. You’ve got a decent storage box under the front-seat armrest, and another lidded cubby down by your right knee for ‘secret storage.’ The glove box is a bit mediocre though, as it’s quite shallow. Getting in and out of the back seats is easy, thanks to doors that open up wide, and it’s a nice touch that the seat padding extends all the way out to cover the wheel arch so you’re not bumping against hard metal. Space is very good for a car of this size, with impressive knee room and a place for your feet under the front seats. The rear seat bases are quite long, too, so the backs of your legs are better-supported on a long journey. Headroom is fine, but if you need to sit three people across the back seat, there’s a massive transmission tunnel to work around. The middle rear seat is actually reasonably roomy aside from that though. For child seats, there are ISOFIX points in the back, with neat flip-up covers for the anchor points, and there’s enough space to get a bulky rear-facing seat in without having to move the front passenger seat forward. The windows are a little on the high side, so the view out for kids isn’t that great, but they do get two USB-C sockets and a 12-volt connection. There are helpful seat-back nets for more storage, and cupholders in the flip-down armrest. In terms of boot space, the 3 Series is on par with any other four-door saloon of a similar size. It actually has 480 litres of space, which is the same as an Audi A4, quite a lot more than the 455 litres of the Mercedes C-Class and way ahead of the 330 litres you get from the Genesis G70 . Remember that the 3 Series Touring estate gets a bonus 20 litres bringing it to 500 litres overall (with 1,510 litres if you fold the back seats) but 330e models lose lots of space to the hybrid battery, leaving the 300e saloon with just 375 litres. The rear seats split-fold in a 40:20:40 ratio, so you can just fold down the narrow centre bit if you need to carry something long. The boot opening is a good size, but there is a bit of a load lip if you need to get something heavy in or out. There are helpful storage nets at the side of the boot though, as well as tie-down hooks and a 12-volt socket. There’s an optional electric bootlid, which seems spectacularly pointless on a saloon. Just lift it up yourself… Levers in the boot make it easy to unlock the back seats for folding, but they’re annoyingly not sprung, so you have to lean into the boot to push them down. They fold almost (but not quite entirely) flat, and there’s enough room to fit in a mountain bike, with wheels attached, when they’re folded. There’s also a folding centre-section of the rear seat to allow you to fit long, narrow stuff even when you’ve got people sitting in the back. With the seats up, there’s enough room for two large and two medium suitcases, AND a set of golf clubs or a baby buggy, which is very decent. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories The inside of the 3 Series really is what you might call classic BMW — even with the big new screens, it still feels logical and sensible, although it’s not quite as simple to use as it was The 3 Series now gets the same big, curved screen that we’ve already seen in the likes of the iX and the i4 , which sits on top of the dashboard, doing away with the old separate instrument binnacle and centre touchscreen. This brings it bang up to date and compete with the newer Mercedes C-Class It’s a very high-tech setup, with all-new graphics that thankfully do away with the old, slightly dark, BMW digital instrument panel. It’s a bit of a shame that you can’t customise the instrument panel layout as much as you can in the C-Class, and that some of the graphics look a bit ‘PlayStation’ at times, but for the most part it’s an impressive addition to the 3 Series’ cabin. There are actually two screens — one for the instruments and another for the infotainment. The infotainment has fairly sensible menu layouts, and you’ll find your way around it easily enough but it can be a little confusing at times. It’s also annoying that BMW has taken away the simple and easy-to-use physical buttons for the air conditioning system and put them on the screen, where you have to press a ‘button’ to get to a separate menu to adjust things. It’s a bit of a faff. You can control the infotainment system by touch, by voice, by using the old-style iDrive click-wheel controller down on the centre console, or by using the buttons on the steering wheel. It can get a bit bewildering at times. Up front, there’s a USB socket and a 12-volt connection in with the cupholders, and an optional wireless phone charger too. A USB-C socket can be found under the front-seat armrest. The overall layout of the controls is really good, with all of your driving controls grouped on the centre console next to the gear selector, but the movement of more and more controls to the big screen makes this new 3 Series slightly more frustrating to use than the old one. The driving position is good, and you can get the seat nice and low for a sporty feel, but there’s enough height adjustment that smaller drivers can still see out properly. The steering wheel has plenty of adjustment too, but the pedals are set annoyingly off to the right a bit — it feels like your feet are in the front wheel arch. MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax In theory, the champion of fuel economy in the 3 Series lineup is the plug-in hybrid 330e. With its ability to run on electric power alone, it can return some spectacular economy figures (as much as 353mpg according to efficiency tests) but to do that you’ll have to plug it in and charge it a lot to get anywhere near that. However, it’s worth plugging the 330e in, as a full charge of the battery gets you 62 all-electric miles, twice the range of the old 330e, and almost a match for the 68 miles of the Mercedes C-Class plug-in. On a longer journey, a 330e will return more like 40-45mpg — not bad, but at the same time not as good as the 60mpg you would have had from a carefully-driven diesel, which makes it a real shame for long-distance drivers you can no longer get one new. Go for the 374hp M340i and you’ll be lucky to get much better than 35mpg out of it… The 330e is unquestionably the emissions champ though, with CO2 emissions of just 19g/km for the rear-wheel drive version, or up to 38g/km for the four-wheel drive model. The next best is the 147g/km for a 320i, depending on which alloy wheels you’ve fitted. The M340i manages an expensive 177g/km. The 330e will cost nothing for the first year of tax for a private buyer, though the 320i isn’t hugely expensive. However, because the basic price of all 3 Series models is now more than £40,000 you’ll also have to pay the ‘pricey-car-surcharge’ in years two to six. For company car buyers, only the 330e makes proper sense, with Benefit-in-Kind costs of just £94 per month. A 320i will cost company car buyers £226 per month, while an M340i will set you back £362 per month… All 3 Series models conform to the latest Euro 6 emissions and RDE2 standards, so you’ll not get hit with ULEZ charges nor the first-year tax supplement. Safety and security Safety and security The 3 Series has a full five-star safety and crash test rating from the independent experts at Euro NCAP , with a 97% score for adult occupants, and an 87% score for both child occupants and vulnerable road users. As standard, all models get Active Guard Plus, which is an emergency automated braking system that can detect cyclists and pedestrians, and the bonnet pops up to cushion an impact if you were ever to hit someone. Plus, you get adaptive LED headlights, stability control, traction control, and tyre pressure monitors. The dynamic brake lights also light up brighter under heavy braking to warn drivers behind you. You get front driver and passenger airbags, a driver’s knee airbag, and front and rear side head airbags. Only the front seats get pelvis and chest airbags, though. For extra security, there are ISOFIX points in the rear seats, an airbag cutoff switch for the front passenger seat, plus built-in emergency calling if you have an accident. You can also specify high-intensity ‘Laser’ headlights that automatically dim for oncoming traffic, a head-up display that projects driving data onto the windscreen, and a Driving Assistant Professional, which helps to keep you in lane and a safe distance from the cars around you on the motorway. There’s also the option of a BMW ‘CarEye’ built-in dash camera which automatically records what happened in the event of an accident, and there’s the option of a built-in vehicle tracker. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems All BMWs come with a three-year, unlimited mileage warranty, and there are cost-options for extending that out beyond three years and up to 100,000 miles. There’s also an inclusive service plan for the 3 Series, which costs £1,004 up front, and which covers all your standard servicing costs for the first five years of ownership, or 62,000 miles. You can also get a pay-monthly inclusive service package for £25.99 per month. The 330e’s hybrid battery is covered for the first eight years or 100,000 miles. BMW also offers its own roadside assistance programme (you’ll need to get an individual quote for the cost), and also offers a specific insurance plan to cover cosmetic damage. Generally speaking, BMWs are well made, and the current 3 Series has been in production long enough for most bugs to be ironed out, but there have been reports of niggles — especially with the infotainment system — will the new big screen layout be more reliable?"
https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/ix3,BMW iX3 Review & Prices,"€78,004",6/10,new,"Is the BMW iX3 a good car? Is the BMW iX3 a good car? The BMW iX3 is the company’s electric SUVs and an alternative to the Audi e-tron, Mercedes EQC , Ford Mustang Mach-E and Skoda Enyaq . It’s the BMW equivalent of the Monsters Inc story. Until now, the company has used scary old petrol and diesel to generate power, but now they’ve found out that laugh-a-minute electricity actually works a whole lot better for everybody, and makes you smile, too. So the iX3 is new, but just doesn’t look it. Up front, there’s the usual BMW grille, but it’s all a clever ruse because it doesn’t have to cool an engine, so it has been sealed to help reduce drag and give the car’s range a small boost. A dimpled pattern breaks up what would otherwise be a big sheet of black plastic. The 20-inch wheels are unique to the BMW iX3, too. Their heavily sculpted design helps to smooth airflow along the side of the car, improving range, although they look exceptionally vulnerable to kerbing. Assorted blue highlights to designate the electric model dotted around the iX3 – most obviously on the rear bumper where you’d normally spot some exhaust pipes – finish off the styling changes. There are also blue highlights around the ‘grille’, the badges and the sills. Under the skin is a solitary 286hp electric motor that also generates 400Nm of torque and drives the rear wheels. There’s an 80kWh battery pack that should give a range of up to 285 miles – that’s according to the latest official testing procedure. That’s a bit more than key alternatives such as the Audi e-tron and Mercedes-Benz EQC, but a bit less than the Jaguar I-Pace . In the real world it will be a bit below that, especially in cold, wet conditions. The iX3 should be compatible with almost every kind of charging station or power outlet, including super-fast 150kW chargers, which can give an 80% recharge in just 34 minutes. This means you can add 60-ish miles of range in about 10 minutes. There aren’t many 150kW chargers in the UK, but the network is growing. Range: 286 - 290 miles Efficiency: 3.4-3.5 miles per kWh Battery size: 74kWh Max charge speed: 150kW / 250kW Charge time AC: 7hrs 30mins, 0-100%, 11kW Charge time DC: 34mins, 0-80%, 150kW Charge port location: Right rear Power outputs: 282hp Charging from less powerful outlets (such as a home wall-box charger or three-pin plug) will take longer – BMW reckons a full charge from empty will take around 12 hours. While electricity prices have risen lately, they’re not rising as fast as the cost of petrol or diesel, so an electric iX3 will still be much cheaper to run than a conventional X3. All electric cars feature brake regeneration – a system that uses the electric motor as an extra brake that can feed energy back to the batteries that would otherwise be lost as the car slows down. This always happens when you press the brake pedal, but the iX3 joins many of the latest electric cars by giving the system the ability to bring you to a stop when you lift off the accelerator pedal, too. It allows for one-pedal driving, which (once you’re used to it) is an extremely relaxing way of dealing with urban traffic. It’s not the fastest version of the X3, but it’s still pretty quick with a 0-60mph time of 6.8 seconds. Top speed is limited to 112mph, which helps to preserve range. It’s more than enough for UK drivers, anyway. The first thing you notice when you get out and about in your iX3 is how quiet it is. There’s no noise from the engine and transmission, so you only notice a little wind and road noise as your speed rises. Adaptive suspension is fitted to the iX3 as standard, so it’s pretty comfortable, although a Mercedes EQC still trumps it for out-and-out ride quality. However, the suspension stops the iX3’s body from rolling too much during cornering. The iX3 grips strongly, too, and its handling is doubtless helped by the fact that the batteries are stored in the floor, lowering the centre of gravity. Flicking the suspension into Sport model firm things up a lot, to the extent that it makes the ride too firm, but it certainly sharpens the handling and gives the iX3 a distinctly sporty feel. All iX3s are well equipped. The entry-level M Sport comes with a 12.3-inch digital driver’s display and 12.3-inch touchscreen infotainment system, wireless phone charging, electrically adjustable leather seats, adaptive suspension (which lets you choose between soft, comfortable settings and stiffer, sportier ones) and a panoramic glass roof. The top-spec M-Sport Pro car has a Harman Kardon audio system, a head-up display and an automatic parking system. If the BMW iX3 is an upmarket electric SUV that ticks all the right boxes for you, make sure you check out our BMW iX3 deals page to find out how much you could save when buying through carwow. How much is the BMW iX3? How much is the BMW iX3? The iX3 seems well-priced against other electric SUVs, for example the Mercedes-Benz EQC costs around £5,000 more in basic trim. The iX3 costs pretty much exactly the same as a Jaguar I-Pace, with similar overall range, so that’s fine too. The problems start to mount up when you compare it to a Tesla Model Y or an Audi Q4 e-tron. Now, theoretically these are smaller cars, but both have cabin space on a par with the iX3, and both can be bought for less cash, and with a longer range. Does the iX3 line up to Audi’s bigger, grander e-tron quattro SUV? Kind of, but that’s arguably closer to BMW’s pricier iX. It’s also worth noting that the Kia EV6 and Hyundai Ioniq 5 are both roomier inside than the iX3, but much cheaper. Think a Hyundai or Kia can’t compete with a BMW? Think again — both have more range, and both have gorgeous, high-tech cabins. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort Super-refined, and actually good fun to drive, but despite the SUV looks it’s rear-drive only Around town and at lower speeds, the iX3 is very, very relaxing and easy to drive. As with most electric cars, noise levels are kept well under control. By knocking the gear selector to the left, you can put the iX3 into ‘B’ mode which ramps up the regenerative braking, slowing you down without using the physical brakes, which is handy in city driving. In fact, B mode will actually bring the car to a complete stop without touching the brake pedal if you have enough space — proper ‘one-pedal’ driving. The turning circle is OK, nothing special but it’s fine, and the steering is nicely light so it’s pretty easy to manoeuvre. The suspension, with the adaptive dampers, rides bumps nicely but it’s a touch firm compared to the likes of the Mercedes EQC. It’s about the same as the Jag I-Pace, though. One annoying thing — the brakes often make an irritating squeaky-groan noise, like someone’s reclining in an old rocking chair. The refinement continues when you take the iX3 up onto the motorway; although you’ll start to notice a bit more tyre roar and wind noise, but it never gets really out of hand. The sheer grunt of the iX3’s single rear-wheel drive electric motor helps when you’re joining a fast-moving motorway as it rockets from 40mph up to 70mph, and the well-tuned suspension means it’ll cling on firmly on a long, curving on-ramp. The EQC and Audi e-tron are, again, a little bit quieter than the BMW, but there’s not a massive gap. The iX3 is really, properly quick. Other EVs with two-motor, four-wheel drive systems might be able to scamper to 62mph faster, but the BMW lives up to its on-paper 6.8secs time — in fact, it might even beat that as we were able to get to 60mph in just under 6.0secs. Speed is one thing, control is another, but the iX3 is all over that. The battery pack is mounted low down in the car’s floor, so its centre of gravity is actually lower than that of a standard diesel or petrol X3, meaning you can chuck it around with plenty of confidence. The steering has pretty good weight and feel, and that firms up if you put it in Sport mode, but the trouble is so too does the suspension, and then things just get a bit too bumpy. Better to leave it in Comfort mode, to be honest. It’s still engaging to drive even then, although it doesn’t quite have the hooligan tendencies of the Ford Mustang Mach-E. It also won’t slide and skid about, in spite of being rear-wheel drive — try to do that and it just kind of understeers like a big electric lump. Even so, it does get BMW’s new-ish traction control system, where the control module is mounted directly to the electric motor so that it can react faster and more accurately any time you start to lose traction. That said, you’re not going to be getting very far off-road with just rear-wheel drive and a ride-height that loses 2cm compared to the standard X3. Space and practicality Space and practicality Lots of space for people but the boot is slightly smaller than that of the regular X3 The iX3’s cabin is basically the same as that of the standard X3, so practicality levels are pretty good. In front of the gear selector, you’ll find two big cup holders, and a storage tray that also has the wireless phone charger. There’s another decently-sized storage area under the armrest between the front seats, and the door bins are pretty big too. The glovebox isn’t the biggest, but it’ll do. Space for people is fine too, although subjectively it doesn’t feel as roomy inside as EV SUV Audis, but it’s about on a par with the Merc EQC. If you want proper stretch-out space in your EV crossover, maybe think Hyundai Ioniq 5… The combination of a slim battery pack and scooped-out front seatbacks means that there’s plenty of space for knees, feet, and heads in the back seats. The seats in the back are also well-designed so you’re not sitting awkwardly with your knees perched up, so you’ll get fewer backaches on a long journey in the back of the iX3. The back seats recline too, so it’s easy to get very comfy. The centre rear seat is a little bit raised up compared to the others, but it’s not too bad and you should be able to get three people sitting comfortably across the back (especially if they’re teenagers). Behind the electric tailgate, the iX3 has a nice square boot with a flat floor, so there’s no load lip between the edge of the bumper and the boot floor. That makes loading heavy boxes and bags so much easier. You get handy storage areas at each side with nets for holding delicate items, and there’s a 12-volt socket for anything that needs to be charged. There are useful tie-down points in the floor, and a handle just inside the edge of the boot that allows you to fold the back seats down. When they’re folded, the boot expands from a standard 510 litres (up to the luggage cover) to 1,560 litres (if you load it to the roof). That is 40 litres less than what you get in a standard X3 though, and you lose the useful under-floor storage area too. There is a small under-floor storage space, which will generally be full of charging cables, but the space that would normally allow you to slot in the retractable luggage cover and so on has been taken up by the rear-mounted electric motor. Annoyingly, even though the motor is at the back and there’s now no engine up front, BMW hasn’t added a front-boot (froot?) to the iX3, so there’s no handy storage space under the bonnet. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories High quality, good comfort, but the infotainment isn’t as good as some others You know how we’ve been saying that the iX3 has a lot of the same bits and pieces as the standard petrol-and-diesel BMW X3 ? Yeah, well get ready for more of the same because… the iX3’s cabin is basically the same as that of the standard X3. Well, what did you expect? The only real differences are that the iX3 gets some little bits of metallic blue trim, which to be honest actually look a little bit cheap, but they do remind you that you’re driving an EV rather than a smelly old diesel. It’s a very comfortable cabin though, and we love the slim-rimmed steering wheel which is so much nicer to hold than the over-stuffed, over-padded wheel of some sportier BMW models. The infotainment system in the iX3 is the iDrive version 7.0, not the ritzier version 8.0 that you’ll find in the bigger iX electric SUV and the low-slung i4 electric four-door coupe. 8.0 gets a dramatic curved touchscreen that runs from in front of the driver half way across the dash. The iX3 makes do with the older system, which has separate 12.3-inch screens for the instruments and the infotainment. To be fair, both work fine — the instrument panel can be configured with different displays between the rev counter and speedo, and there’s an optional, and very useful, heads-up display which shines your speed and sat nav directions onto the windscreen. The central infotainment display is a touchscreen, but you can also use the old-school BMW iDrive click-wheel down on the centre console, which is possibly a bit safer to use when you’re on the move. The menu layout is fairly simple, and the fact that BMW has kept proper physical controls for the air conditioning makes things a bit easier and simpler. You do get wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connections, although these can be a bit hit-and-miss when it comes to connecting, so you might be better off just using a physical cable most of the time. There’s a clever feature in the sat nav in that it knows when you’re coming up to an area with the lower speed limit, and it can automatically start to slow the car down using the regenerative braking, topping up the battery a little and making sure you arrive at the new speed zone at the correct limit. It does feel a bit weird at first — as if the car has developed a mind of its own — but you can turn it off if you don’t like it. In general, it’s a good system but BWM’s own newer version 8.0 setup is better still, and we prefer — if only just — Mercedes’ MBUX infotainment system. Electric range, charging and tax Electric range, charging and tax You don’t get any options when it comes to the iX3’s battery and motor — there’s a single choice of an 80kWh (gross, the actual useable capacity is 74kWh) battery and a single rear-mounted electric motor developing 286hp. Now, BMW claims a range on one charge of up to 282 miles, which is competitive with the likes of Jaguar’s I-Pace and the Mercedes EQC, but slightly behind what you’ll get from a Tesla Model Y, or indeed the likes of the Kia EV6 or Hyundai Ioniq 5. During our testing, we managed a respectable 3.6 miles per kWh and got 281 miles from the battery. That's 91% of its claimed range, the joint-highest percentage in the test, tied with the Kia EV6. Its efficiency figure was decent but still behind the best-in-class on the day of 3.7 miles per kWh, achieved by the EV6 and Ford Mustang Mach-e. If you can find a public charger putting out 150kW, then the iX3 can add 237 miles of range in as little as 30 minutes, which is good. Plus, BMW is part of the IONITY high-speed charger consortium, so you’ll get access to those chargers at cheaper rates than pay-as-you-go customers. For slower AC charging, the iX3 can take in an 11kW charge which is handy when you’re using kerb-side or shopping centre chargers. Oh, and with zero-emissions you’ll be paying no road tax in your first year. Nothing. Zip. Nada. Safety and security Safety and security Euro NCAP, the nice helpful people who slam new cars into walls so that you don’t have to, hasn’t tested the iX3 itself, but the standard X3 got a full five-star safety rating when it was tested back in 2017. That included a 93% score for adult occupant protection, and 84% for child occupants, both of which are impressive. As standard, the iX3 comes with active radar guided cruise control which can slow you down to a stop in heavy traffic, steering that keeps you in your lane on a motorway, a speed limit assistant that reads road signs and gives you a warning to slow down if you need to and an active side collision protection system that stops you pulling out into the path of another car when you’re changing lanes. The iX3 comes as standard with LED headlights, but these can be optionally upgraded to BMW’s Laser Lights, which can throw a main-beam 600 metres up the road, and which have active elements to stop you dazzling other road users. M-Sport Pro models also come with the Parking Assistant Plus which not only has a surround-view camera system, but which can also back you into a parking space, taking care of the braking and all. The M-Sport Pro also uses the windscreen mounted camera that scans the road ahead for potential collisions as a traffic camera, recording video in the event of a crash. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems BMWs aren’t always as reliable as you might expect, sometimes suffering small niggling issues with electrics and infotainment systems. Generally speaking, the X3 is one of BMW’s better cars when it comes to quality and longevity, and the fact that the iX3 has fewer moving parts (electric motors are way, way simpler than petrol or diesel engines) should make for fewer faults going forward. All BMW i-badged electric models come with a three-year, unlimited mileage warranty and an extra eight-year 100,000-mile warranty for the battery. BMW iX3 FAQs BMW iX3 FAQs"
https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/x7,BMW X7 Review & Prices,"€121,744",9/10,new,"Is the BMW X7 a good car? Is the BMW X7 a good car? Let’s address the elephant in the room – oh, and this elephant also has a set of comedy gnashers on. Yes, the way the BMW X7 looks will not be to everybody’s taste, but if you like your large luxurious SUVs to be imposing, it doesn’t get much more so than the X7’s whopping great grille filling somebody’s rearview mirror. In fact, the BMW X7 is arguably more imposing than the upmarket SUVs it competes with, the Land Rover Discovery , Audi Q7 and Mercedes GLS . Even a full-fat Range Rover. Think of it as American sports announcer Michael Buffer at a headteacher’s conference. Inside, things are more restrained, but suitably high quality. You’ll find plenty of piano black, leather and metal surfaces, while adding a (pricey) full merino leather option brings leather lower down and a two-tone shade. Ultimately, you’ll struggle to find any scratchy plastics here and the X7 gives all its alternatives a run for their money inside. The dash is dominated by the curved twin-screen display that incorporates BMW’s latest iDrive infotainment system. It’s stunning to look at, but not quite as easy to use as the previous generation. There are a few functions that are now buried in menus rather than easily accessible with a single button press. It still has a rotary controller with menu shortcut buttons between the front seats, and you can choose to use that, the touchscreen or use voice commands. The second screen behind the steering wheel takes the place of conventional instruments. It’s clear, crisp and configurable, so you can have the information displayed that you want, including things like speed, fuel consumption, navigation info and your radio or media selection. Bluetooth, DAB radio and Apple CarPlay smartphone mirroring is all included, although not Android Auto . All-in-all, it’s better than anything from Audi or Land Rover , although the digital dash and infotainment in the Mercedes GLS is even better. The BMW X7 is a proper seven-seater as standard, which is to say, two adults will be able to sit in comfort in its rearmost seats on a long journey. A BMW X5 ’s optional third row is much tighter, for example. The X7’s front two rows are even more spacious and the driver is treated to a wide range of electric seat and wheel adjustment. In fact, the middle row can be adjusted and folded electrically, while the third row folds into the boot floor electrically too. Handy buttons in the boot allow you to fold the rear two rows all at the same time for ease. Even with all seven seats up, the X7 still offers 320 litres of boot space, which is about the same as a VW Polo. Fold the rearmost seats down and that grows to a huge 750 litres – that’ll handle pretty much anything a family can throw at it. And you get a fancy split tailgate. You have a choice between one diesel and two petrol engines when buying a BMW X7. The pick of the bunch is the X7 xDrive40d diesel because, with 352hp and an official fuel economy of 32.8-36.2mpg, it has all the power you’ll need, but will keep the bills sensible. The 530hp M60i petrol is much quicker, but also much more expensive in every way, while the 381hp 40i petrol is strong and smooth, but thirstier than the diesel. The BMW X7 is vast, so driving and parking it in town can be a little daunting. Still, it comes with front and rear sensors, multiple cameras for a 3D view of the car and a system that’ll park and even reverse for you. So, no excuses then. Out of town and on meandering country roads the X7 is one of the tidiest SUVs of its type to drive despite its size, but you’ll probably be more interested in just how comfortable its air suspension is over bumps and how quiet it is at a cruise on the motorway. There’s very little wind and road noise at all, and adding BMW’s Driving Assistant Professional optional package brings a system that will accelerate, brake and keep you in your lane for an even more relaxing drive. So, make peace with its looks, don’t get carried away with BMW’s options list and the X7 is a fine luxury seven-seat SUV. Remember, though, that it’s more expensive to buy than a Discovery or Q7, and that if you don’t need seven roomy seats, BMW’s cheaper X5 makes much more sense.

How much is the BMW X7? So, whichever way you cut it, the X7 is an expensive car. The diesel is both the cheapest to buy and run, so that’s where the sensible money goes. Then again, where’s the fun in being sensible? The petrol cars – especially the M60i – are great to drive. Even the entry-level Excellence spec comes loaded with standard kit, so there’s no need to spend more. The M Sport upgrades are largely cosmetic, although you do get uprated brakes. The M60i is a spec level of its own, and it’s very expensive. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort Air suspension makes for a comfortable ride, and all versions are quick, but the sheer size of the X7 means it’s not most at home in tight urban surroundings The elephantine looks are matched to elephantine dimensions, so this isn’t an easy car to drive in narrow city streets. Even if you are used to a big 4x4, the likes of the X7 or Merc GLS take up a whole postcode. You sit up high, though, which gives a good view out so it’s not too hard to judge where the car’s extremities are. If the third row of seats are upright the view behind you is not so good because the head restraints are in the way. It’s just as well the X7 comes with cameras to help when parking. Rear-wheel steering is optional on most versions, but standard on the M60i. It’s well worth paying for if you spend a lot of time in town, as it turns the rear wheels in the opposite direction to the fronts during low-speed manoeuvres to make the turning circle more manageable. Once you are used to the sheer size of the thing, you can enjoy the comfortable ride. Air suspension is standard and copes well with speed bumps and potholes. Motorways suit the big X7 better than town driving, especially if you pay the extra for the Technology Plus Pack, which includes the Driving Assistance Professional features. These take care of steering, accelerating and braking under the watchful eye of the driver to make long trips more relaxing. Even without this pack, the X7 is a superb tool for racking up high mileages. There’s very little engine or tyre noise, despite the colossal size of the wheels. You do hear some wind flutter, but nothing too intrusive. All three engines have more than enough performance for motorway driving. The diesel is the smart choice, as it will be more economical than either of the petrol models. Don’t buy the X7 expecting it to handle like a Porsche Cayenne . For a car of this size and weight, though, it’s enjoyable to drive on a twisty road. The M60i is the best of the bunch. The air suspension has a sportier set-up and a clever anti-roll system that keeps the car flat in the bends even when you’re hustling along. And it has all that power. It is a big old car, though, and the narrower the road the more you feel that the car’s bulk gets in the way of the fun. It’s at its best on open, sweeping roads rather than narrow back routes. Space and practicality Space and practicality Absolutely huge inside – even the third row is roomy Something would need to be seriously amiss for a 5.2-metre-long SUV to be anything less than spacious and practical. BMW has made full use of the X7’s dimensions – your first flat probably had less space. The driver has the best seat in the house. You sit up really high, and although the driving position is not quite as regal as a Range Rover’s, it’s not far off. You look down on other road users and can see over the top of smaller cars when you’re stuck in traffic. Even with the standard-fit panoramic sunroof, there’s lots of headroom for tall drivers, and with electric seat adjustment and memory you can fine-tune the driving position until it’s just how you like it. Comfort seats are standard, although sportier chairs are available as an option if you want more support when cornering. Legroom is equally generous, and if you’re at the other end of the height spectrum you can lift the seat high enough for a good view out. There’s plenty of storage, even though the handbook and air fresheners eat up most of the space in the glovebox. There are big door bins, and twin cupholders between the two front seats. You also get more storage space under the armrest. The X7 comes with seven seats as standard, although you can opt for a six-seat layout with two individual chairs in the second row if you prefer. Unlike some seven seaters, even the third row is reasonably spacious. Adults can be surprisingly comfortable unless they are very tall, and there’s more under-thigh support than you get in most third rows. There’s loads of room if you are sat in the middle row. The seats move back and forth electrically, so you can give those in the very back some of your legroom. There’s plenty to start with, so you can afford to be generous. The width of the car means you can seat three in the second row without anyone feeling hemmed in. As standard, there are separate temperature controls for either side of the cabin. Another advantage of being absolutely bloomin’ huge is the boot space the X7 offers, even with all seven seats in place. The 320-litre capacity is easily enough for a weekly shop. Lower the back seats and that jumps to 750 litres, which is absolutely huge. We’re talking room for a family’s holiday bags, even if your tribe never travel light. For comparison, a Mercedes GLS has 355 litres in seven-seat mode, rising to 890 with the rearmost two folded and a BMW X5 has up to 650 litres in five-seat form, and a Land Rover Discovery has 258 litres with all seven seats up, but that goes up to 1137 with the back two folded. The X7’s third row can be folded too, making an enormous space for tip runs, although the X7 seems too posh for carrying garden rubbish. You won’t need to leave the luggage cover behind, as there’s room to stash it under the floor. The folding tailgate is another handy feature, so you have somewhere to perch when taking wellies off after a walk in the country. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories Superbly made with an impressive but complicated infotainment system The outside of the X7 is not going to please everyone, but the interior is less controversial. This is an extremely stylish and well-made machine – it’s more of a luxury car on stilts than a conventional SUV. The dashboard is dominated by the twin-screen display, which BMW has fitted to the X7 since its mid-life facelift. The two screens sit side by side so at first glance they look like one display, curving over the top of the dashboard. With punchy colours and crisp graphics it’s an eye-catching set up. The display in front of the driver can be configured to prioritise different information, and in the M60i it features ‘M’ colours to remind you that you’re sat in the super-fast range-topper. The infotainment is taken care of by the second screen. Again, it looks stunning, and BMW’s iDrive rotary controller remains a clever way to manage a complex system. However, in trying to keep the dash design clean and minimal, more functions are now buried in a touchscreen menu, rather than easily accessible through buttons on the dashboard or steering wheel. Although the latest set-up looks amazing, we think the previous-generation was easier to use. Take the climate control. You have to push a button to pull up the climate control menu, which is a bit of a faff. Even more annoyingly, whereas before you could adjust the distance setting for the adaptive cruise control using a button on the steering wheel, you now need to go through a series of on-screen menus, which is distracting while you are driving. Once you’ve found the settings you want, just sit back and enjoy the quality of the cabin. There are high-class materials wherever you look. Even the entry-spec Excellence cars have merino leather upholstery and Sensatec (an artificial leather) on the dash. MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax Since being facelifted, the X7 has come with a mild hybrid system to take some strain off the engine and improve fuel economy and emissions. There’s a limit to what a 48-volt starter-generator can achieve, though – every X7 is a heavy and powerful car. The obvious choice if you want to keep fuel bills sensible is to pick the xDrive40d diesel. It returns 32.8-36.2mpg, which is reasonable for a car of this size and performance. The xDrive 40i petrol is a lot thirstier, returning 26.6-29.4mpg. Unsurprisingly, the 530hp drinks like a rugby prop forward, with an official economy of 21.9-23.2mpg. Use all that performance and you’ll be lucky to get anywhere near that. There’s no plug-in hybrid or fully electric X7, although the pure-electric BMW iX should be on your shortlist if you want a big 4x4 but plan to turn your back on fossil fuels. For company car drivers , every version of the X7 sits in the top 37% tax bracket as emissions are so high. Even the diesel emits 205-225g/km of carbon dioxide. For private buyers, all X7 models cost well over the £40,000 barrier so attract a £390 annual surcharge for five years once the first year’s Vehicle Excise Duty runs out, as well as ranking high on the scale for first year road tax. Safety and security Safety and security The X7 comes with lots of safety kit as standard. BMW’s Attentiveness Assistant will warn if it thinks you are getting tired, and autonomous emergency braking will slow the car if you’re not paying attention. You get enough airbags to raise a sunken ship, and a sophisticated stability control system. More driver aids can be added to the standard spec with the Technology Plus Pack, although this is very expensive. The crash-test boffins at Euro NCAP have not tested the X7, although the smaller X5 SUV scored the maximum five stars when tested in 2018. Security kit includes an alarm. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems BMW tends to sit in the middle of owner satisfaction and reliability surveys, although some models perform better than others. This is a complex and highly sophisticated car, so there’s plenty that could go wrong. However, we’re not hearing any horror stories about the X7. Like other BMW models, the X7 comes with a three-year warranty which should protect against any unexpected bills. For cast-iron reliability from a large SUV, we’d consider a Lexus RX."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/i5,BMW i5 Review & Prices,"€103,931",9/10,new,"Is the BMW i5 a good car? Is the BMW i5 a good car? The BMW i5 is a bit like an alcohol-free pilsner. You still enjoy the refreshing taste of German lager, but it’s better for you – or in this case the planet. You see, the new i5 is the all-electric version of the latest BMW 5 Series. So you can choose a traditional pilsner if you can live with an internal-combustion hangover, or pick the EV if you want to wake up feeling refreshed and virtuous in the morning. If you plan to stick with a conventionally powered BMW for a while longer, have a read of our review of the 5 Series . Here we’re focusing on the all-electric i5, and spoiler alert, it's good. The two models look broadly similar from the outside. With a smaller grille than some recent BMWs, the styling isn’t as divisive as other current Beemers. It’s a bit more understated, but it's certainly not a looker – though we have a feeling that the looks will grow on us as we become more used to the design. A slow-burner, maybe. There are two power outputs to choose from. The less powerful is the i5 eDrive40, which has one 340hp motor powering the rear wheels. Step up to the M60 for two electric motors, one for the front wheels and one for the rears. Being four-wheel drive has to be a good thing when the car has 601hp. The regular eDrive40 is quick, with a 0-62mph time of six seconds. The M60 reaches 62mph in a kidney-bruising 3.8 seconds. Both models have the same battery pack, with an 81.2 kWh usable capacity. In the less powerful, lighter model, that gives an official range of up to 357 miles, dropping to a maximum of 315 miles for the heavier range-topper. That compares with 376 miles for a Mercedes EQE 350, one of the alternatives that could be on your shortlist if you are looking for an upmarket electric saloon. Will you be able to travel that far in the real world? Well, the way you drive will make a big difference. When Mat drove the M60 in Portugal the range was closer to 200 miles, but car reviewers aren’t renowned for driving gently. Assume that’s a worst-case scenario, and the official numbers are a best case. Plenty of electric cars are fast in a straight line, but BMWs are supposed to be fun around corners as well. The i5 corners with poise, especially cars with adaptive sports suspension and active anti-roll bars. The trouble is, the i5 is heavier than the regular 5 Series saloon, weighing as much as a big 4x4 . The M60 is especially heavy, which is a shame as the car doesn’t feel as light on its feet as we’d hope. Get carried away and the front tyres push wide surprisingly early. Drive more steadily and the i5 is remarkably comfortable and super-quiet, with only a murmur of wind and road noise. Inside, the cabin is a high-tech banquet for the eyes, with a huge twin-screen display and an exceptional standard of finish. Even lower down the dash and doors there’s no sign of penny-pinching. Only the brittle action of the indicator stalks feels less than premium. There’s plenty of space front and rear, too, although the big transmission tunnel that exists for the internal-combustion-engined 5 Series gets in the way if there are three passengers in the back. The car is packed with clever tech, although frustratingly perhaps the smartest technology of all isn’t available in the UK. The optional upgrade for the adaptive cruise control available in some markets will change lanes for you. All the driver needs to do is look in their mirrors to check that it’s safe, and the car’s sensors can tell that you’ve looked to the side and will swap lanes. Where legal, the driver can even take their hands off the wheel. The eye activation feature is launching initially in Germany, the USA and Canada. A UK launch date for the automated lane-changing function has not been confirmed. So, clever, quick, and very good to drive – if not quite great compared with BMW’s greatest hits of the past. Next to other electric saloons, though, the i5 is pretty much as good as it gets, and if you need a bit more practicality, a BMW i5 Touring is coming later this year.

How much is the BMW i5? The i5 is a lot more expensive to buy than a petrol-powered 5 Series. On the other hand, the EV will be much cheaper to run, and for company car drivers the tax incentives for running an electric car make picking the i5 over the regular 5 an easy choice. Obvious alternatives to the i5 are few, the most likely being the Mercedes-Benz EQE. The entry-level EQE 300 Mercedes costs less than the most affordable i5, but it’s a lot less powerful. Then EQE 350 is closer to the i5 in terms of power and pace, and costs a bit more. You might also be considering the Porsche Taycan , which is pricier than the i5. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort Super-fast and comfortable, but feels a bit heavy when the road goes twisty Even a hardened EV-sceptic could be converted by the i5 around town. It really is a great way to get from one side of the city to another. Performance is a given with either the eDrive40 or the M60. Both cars will leap into any gap in traffic. But it’s not the way the i5 accelerates that makes it so well suited to urban driving, it’s how quiet and comfortable the car is. Motor noise is almost non-existent, you just waft along in near silence. And of course, there’s no jolt when the gearbox changes ratio, as there’s just one forward gear. It’s such a smooth and relaxing experience it’s hard to be annoyed, even if someone cuts you up in heavy traffic. In some electric cars the brakes can be grabby and a little unpredictable, but the i5’s brakes are easy to apply smoothly. Your passengers will think you’ve retrained as a chauffeur. Although it’s a big car, decent all-round visibility makes for easy manoeuvres and parking. Any i5 makes a great motorway car. It’s super-quiet, so much so that you’ll need to keep a close eye on your speed. Even on big alloy wheels, road noise is kept in check and there’s no more than a flutter of wind noise. The ride is very well judged if your car comes with adaptive suspension, taut and controlled but far from harsh in the more comfortable setting. The only downside to long drives in the i5 is that recharging isn’t as quick and easy as topping up a fuel tank, but the same is true of any electric car. The i5 is a satisfying machine to drive when the traffic clears and the road starts to twist and turn. It’s certainly more fun than a Mercedes EQE. The trouble is, the i5 doesn’t reward keen drivers the way the old 5 Series did. It’s a very heavy car, especially the M60 with the extra weight of a second motor and four-wheel drive. Don’t get the idea that the i5 drives like a tank – far from it. This is one of the most enjoyable electric cars around. But compared with, say, the 550i from the previous generation, the i5 is less agile and more prone to gently push the front tyres wide. In between the bends, the i40 is fast and the M60 ferocious. Space and practicality Space and practicality It’s roomy and well made, but the i5 has less boot space than a petrol 5 Series As soon as you step inside the cabin, the quality is obvious. It’s spacious too, with plenty of room up front for tall drivers. Whichever spec you choose, the driver’s seat moves electrically. Adjustable lumbar support is included, which is good news if you suffer from back pain. There’s a wide range of height adjustment, so you can sit low to the floor for a sporty driving position or lift the seat up for a better view. The steering wheel moves in and out and up and down over a broad range, so we can’t see many drivers failing to be comfortable. The standard seats have plenty of side support to hold you in place while cornering without being too narrow or restrictive – just what you want in a sports saloon. Sitting comfortably? Good. Then look around, and you’ll find there’s plenty of storage. The door bins are a healthy size, large enough to cope with a flask or a big bottle of water. There’s more storage under the driver’s armrest, which opens to either side so rear-seat passengers can reach inside as well as those in the front. There’s a 12-volt socket in there, should you need to power a device that doesn’t use USB charging. There are two USB-C ports between the front seats which are more likely to be in demand than the old-fashioned 12-volt socket. There’s also a wireless charging pad to do away with the need for cables completely. The glovebox is big enough to be useful for more than just gloves, and it’s lined with felt so whatever you put inside won’t rattle around. Head and legroom are plentiful, no surprise there when BMW has made the i5 longer, wider and taller than the old 5 Series, with an extra 20mm between the front and rear wheels. The back of the cabin isn’t without its quirks, though. It’s odd that there are no map pockets on the back of the front seats, and the raised floor to accommodate the batteries means your legs are pushed up, giving less under-thigh support. It’s not uncomfortable, but it could be better. Plus there’s a big hump in the floor to house the transmission of internal-combustion-engined models. It really gets in the way when travelling with three in the back. The Mercedes EQE has a flat floor and is more accommodating of a trio of rear-seat passengers. If you want lots of luggage room you may prefer the upcoming i5 Touring (BMW-speak for estate ). But the i5 saloon’s boot will be big enough for many with a capacity of 490 litres. That’s a few litres down compared with the petrol 5 Series but offers more room for bags than a Mercedes EQE. There’s not much of a load lip to lift items over and the opening is quite large by saloon standards. The rear bench can be folded down in three parts if you need more space, although you’ll need to reach a long way inside to give the seat backs a shove. How about powered folding, BMW? Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories High quality and loads of tech, although it can take some getting used to the raft of menus and controls on the touchscreen system BMW’s exterior styling tends to divide opinion. The interiors are less controversial, but no less striking. The i5’s cabin is superb, both in the standard of finish and the technology on show. The twin screens grab you first. We say two screens, although to look at you’d think they were one as if you’d accidentally loaded a wide screen TV in the front instead of the boot. Directly ahead of the driver is the Information Display, measuring a whopping 12.3 inches across. Next door is the Control Display, which is even bigger at 14.9 inches. The smaller screen handles the essentials, such as speed and charge level. It can be tailored to show different information. The graphics are sharp, modern and colourful. If anything, the larger touchscreen is even more impressive, with a high-resolution display and a near-immediate response to the touch. It’s so big, though, that you may need telescopic arms to reach icons on the far side. It’s better to use the smart-looking iDrive rotary controller, which is less distracting on the move. Or try voice commands to save taking your hands from the wheel at all. BMW says the Operating System 8.5 is easier to use than the earlier 8.0. Perhaps so, but there’s still an awful lot going on so there’s a learning curve to getting the most from it. Some new functions are welcome additions, such as the facility to watch YouTube videos while stationary or play video games using your smartphone as a display. Don’t dismiss those features as gimmicks – they’ll come in handy if you need to recharge on a long journey. Although whether playing ‘Go Kart Go’ makes a proper rest from driving is a moot point. Proper buttons are few in number, but BMW has used physical controls on the steering wheel rather than the touch-sensitive pads favoured by Mercedes. That’s a sensible decision, as it’s too easy to brush the palm of your hand against the Merc’s touchpad while turning the wheel. Electric range, charging and tax Electric range, charging and tax Being an electric car, the i5 has no exhaust emissions. That doesn’t mean there’s no pollution associated with the car’s production or use, but the greener the electricity used to charge the batteries, the greener the car. The lighter, single-motored eDrive40 is the more efficient model, with official consumption of 3.3-3.9 miles per kWh depending on spec, and wheel choice in particular. That drops to 3.0-3.4 miles per kWh for the M60 xDrive. Being more efficient means a longer range of up to 357 miles for the eDrive40, compared with up to 315 miles for the more powerful version. The cost of recharging will vary hugely, but a dedicated EV tariff with overnight charging at home will keep running costs to a minimum . For charging mid-journey, the i5 is compatible with DC charging at up to 205kW for a range increase of up to 97 miles in 10 minutes. For company car drivers, there are big tax incentives to encourage the take up of electric cars. Between now and the end of the 2024/25 tax year, the Benefit-in-Kind tax rate is just 2%. That means teeny-tiny tax bills, even when running a premium-priced executive car like the i5. There are tax benefits to running an electric car for private buyers, too. Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) costs nothing in the first year on the road, or in subsequent years until April 2025. From then on electric car drivers will have to pay some VED, although at a much lower level than petrol or diesel cars. Safety and security Safety and security The latest 5 Series and its electric i5 brother have not yet been tested by the safety experts at Euro NCAP . However, the previous generation 5 Series scored five stars. In the past couple of years BMW has earned five stars three times and four stars twice, so anything less for the i5 would be a surprise. Although kitted out with lots of safety features as standard, if you want to geek-out on the very best in driver aids you’ll need the Tech Pack Plus. This includes Distance Control with Stop & Go function and Steering and Lane Control Assistant. What you don’t get in the UK – for now at least – is Active Lane Change Assistant. This will prompt the driver to change lanes, which the driver approves by simply looking in the side mirror. Pity us poor drivers in the UK who need to steer from one lane to the other for ourselves. There’s no confirmation as to when the Active Lane Change Assistant function will be added to UK cars. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems German cars are often thought of as reliable, but the reality isn’t quite so straightforward. BMW tends to finish in the midfield in reliability and ownership satisfaction surveys rather than at the top alongside the likes of Lexus. Some models fare better than others, though, and the previous 5 Series has a solid reputation for durability. That bodes well for the new i5. What’s more, electric cars tend to be more reliable than petrols and diesels with fewer moving parts to go wrong. If problems occur there’s a three-year, unlimited-mileage warranty to fall back on, and an eight-year, 100,000-mile warranty for the battery."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/4-series,BMW 4 Series Review & Prices,"€63,224",9/10,new,"Is the BMW 4 Series a good car? Is the BMW 4 Series a good car? The BMW 4 Series is an upmarket coupe that seats four and is designed to be more stylish and fun to drive than the BMW 3 Series saloon on which it’s based. It’s also more fun than its main alternatives, the Audi A5 and Mercedes C-Class Coupe . The two-door 4 Series Coupe sits in a family of 4 Series models, along with the convertible and five-door Gran Coupe models, while the BMW i4 is the electric version of the regular 4 Series Coupe, with the coupe and convertible getting updates in 2024 . But in terms of styling, if the German coupes were in an orchestra, the Audi and Mercedes would be tickling the triangle while the BMW tries its best on the tuba – that grille makes the most noise. Some will like it and some really won’t. Still, beyond that, the 4 Series is a good looking car. Its aggressive creases, sporty body kit and sloping roofline make it a sort of half-price BMW 8 Series . Inside, it’s not as in-your-face as a C-Class in terms of design, but it’s classier and the levels of quality are better than in both Mercedes and Audi. In Mercedes’ larger cars its infotainment system narrowly beats BMW’s for visual drama and the way it works, but in the 4 Series and C-Class (where Mercedes fits its older systems), it’s the BMW that takes the win. The BMW’s looks better, works better and comes with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto . Praise be. Audi’s system comes a close third on all fronts. The 4 Series has seating for four people and those in the front seats will have all the space they need. The driver gets a good amount of adjustment, but it’s disappointing that lumbar adjustment – good for staying comfortable on long drives – isn’t standard and only comes as part of a very expensive pack. Grrr. The rear seats are fine for legroom, even for adults, but they’ll struggle with head room if they are anywhere close to six foot. Getting in and out of the back is a struggle too, because there are no rear doors – but hey, it’s a coupe. Still, the 4 Series’ boot is a generous 440 litres, which is only slightly smaller than an A5’s and some way bigger than the C-Class Coupe’s. There’s lots of engine choice, and there isn’t a bad one. There are 2.0-litre and 3.0-litre petrol and diesels, ranging from 184hp to 374hp, but the majority of people will find the 184hp 420i 2.0-litre petrol a great choice. Do more motorway miles? The 190hp 420d 2.0-litre diesel will cruise more efficiently. If you want maximum punch, the M440d diesel and M440i petrol both have powerful six-cylinder engines with startling performance. Then there’s the high-performance BMW M4 , which we have reviewed separately. Handily, all 4 Series models are huge fun to drive. They’re lower and stiffer than a BMW 3 Series , and turn into corners with more agility than an A5 or C-Class Coupe. The xDrive all-wheel drive system is available with the 420d and standard on the M440 models for added security in slippery conditions, plus BMW offers things like upgraded brakes, a sports differential and adaptive suspension to really spice things up. The M models get this as standard. That agility does mean the 4 Series feels harder over bumps in town, even in its most comfortable driving mode, but otherwise, its standard parking sensors and rear camera make light work of parking. On the motorway, the suspension feels less abrupt and the 4 Series cruises quietly, but like the lumbar support, BMW’s clever adaptive cruise control with lane-keep steering assist costs a fortune to add as part of a pack. More grrr. Despite these minor setbacks, we think the 4 Series is the best of its breed. See how much you could save on a new BMW 4 Series with carwow , or check out our latest used BMWs . And if you need to sell your car , we can help with that too! How much is the BMW 4 Series? How much is the BMW 4 Series? The executive coupe arena is a popular one with a number of useful models vying for business. Aside from the 4 Series, two of the most sought-after models are the Audi A5 Coupe and the Mercedes C-Class Coupe – both priced from around the same level as the BMW. Clearly there’s not much in it when it comes to cost and this trio all offer a similar level of specification across their ranges. The trims run from Sport to M Sport and xDrive M Sport. Expect to pay around an extra £1,400 for the 420 M Sport over the base model and additional £3,000 for the more powerful engine. The range-topping xDrive model is currently priced at getting on for £55,000. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort The BMW 4 Series comes into its own at higher speeds, but is not the most comfortable in town The majority of the time spent with the 4 Series is likely to be in town, where the car’s suspension still feels quite firm, even in Comfort mode. It’s noticeable over bumps and, while it’s not awful, it’s enough to possibly get on your nerves after a while. What is a positive is the automatic gearbox, which is smooth, seamless and works effortlessly up and down the gears. That’s an important attribute in town, where a lot of the driving is likely to be stop-start and between 10-30mph most of the time. Visibility is OK from the driver’s seat looking forwards, with the front pillars slim enough to prevent them from creating a blindspot. Out of the back window, due to the overall shape of the vehicle, it’s a slightly different matter. The window is relatively narrow anyway but, when you factor in the headrests and wide wide rear pillars, not much can be seen out of the rear. Thankfully the 360-degree camera and parking sensors come into their own here to help out when reversing into tight spaces or pulling out into traffic. There is also an automated parking system available as an option, which will be a useful addition for lots of drivers. When cruising at higher speeds, the 4 Series is a lot more comfortable, compared with the urban environment. The suspension feels planted and all of those bumps that are felt in town suddenly become far less noticeable when pressing on. All of the engines have plenty of power, which means accelerating and overtaking is done with ease, making manoeuvres much safer to carry out on the motorways. The automatic gearbox helps here, too, with changes that are both smooth and very responsive when you put your foot down. Cruising at speed is relaxing because the cabin stays relatively quiet. There’s minimal wind and tyre noise, although there would be a bit less noise with different tyres, instead of BMW’s runflats. Within the ‘Sport’ driving modes, there are a range of options to play with in the 4 Series: Standard; Plus; Individual and Configure Individual, for the ultimate in personalisation. In Sports Plus mode, the suspension is in its firmest setting to stop the car leaning when going into corners. That setup provides a very sporty feel and drivers will be able to get a lot of enjoyment travelling through B-roads and country lanes. The 4 Series feels a bit sharper than the 3 Series, but that’s no surprise, given the former is designed to be the sportier model in the BMW small(er) car range. Space and practicality Space and practicality There is plenty of space and storage options in the 4 Series, however the Audi A5 Coupe has a larger boot The 4 Series takes its lead from the 3 Series with the interior, which means the seating position is good and can be adjusted with ease thanks to the electronic adjustments and underthigh support. The steering wheel moves manually, but in all directions, so it is easy to get right, or to reposition if someone else is getting behind the wheel. Drivers sit quite low down to create a more sports car feel, but should that not work for you, there’s a lot of upward movement possible. Storage is very good in the 4 Series – there is a nice spot for a mobile phone, and next to that area is a USB port and a 12V socket to power electronic devices. The cupholders located here are a good size and will hold small or medium bottles. Anything larger can be stowed in the door bins, which are pretty large and will also accommodate big items with relative ease. There’s more storage in the central front section behind the gear lever and infotainment control panel, plus another USB port and a decent-sized space for wallet, keys, packets of sweets, or whatever other items you might like or need to carry around. The glovebox is an average size, but the felt lining – helping prevent things moving around when stored away – maintains the quality feel of the rest of the interior. To the right hand side of the steering column there’s another storage box that will hold keys or other small items. The Coupe design means getting into the back seats can be a bit of a challenge. Thankfully the front seats slide forwards plenty and with ease, which makes life a little simpler. The new 4 Series has a longer space between the front and rear wheels than previous cars, which means there is more room inside the new model. As a result, legroom is really good, unlike the headroom. Any average sized adult may have to slide down the seat a bit, which will impact their own comfort. However, this is made a bit more difficult because the rear seats are quite upright, so you’ll end up sitting uncomfortably. Not ideal for long journeys. There’s an armrest, with covered cupholders as well as a ski hatch for through-loading. The BMW also has ISOFIX points, complete with covers that actually stay in place, so you are less likely to lose them or have trouble rescuing them from the floor under the seats in front. Rear passengers get their own climate controls, as well as USB ports. There is also another storage area on the sides of the car, enough to carry a can of drink. The boot on the 4 Series has been measured at 440 litres, which is just shy of that found in an Audi A5 Coupe (455 litres). However, the BMW beats the Mercedes C-Class Coupe, where the boot space is just 380 litres. So, it’s a decent-sized boot and is also square, which makes life easier when loading and packing before a long journey. If, however, you’re looking for a BMW with more room in the boot, then go for a 3 Series Touring. There are some useful netting on the sides and, usefully the rear seats can be released via levers mounted at the top of the boot. As a result, there is a nice flat floor, although the top boot line means that space is a bit restricted, which might rule out being able to transport large boxes easily and safely. Practicality-wise there are a few hooks and another 12V socket. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories The quality level of the materials is good in the 4 Series and the infotainment is very intuitive, but the driver’s display is quite dark and can sometimes be difficult to read The fact that the interior of the 4 Series is very much like a 3 Series is certainly not a negative. There are lots of soft touch materials and everything around the cabin feels solid and very well put together. There are a number of reasons that the 3 Series is the benchmark in its class and the interior is one of them. The infotainment system comprises two large screens – one in the centre of the car, the other behind the steering wheel. On the former, the 4 Series package uses the latest version of BMW’s iDrive technology, which can be controlled either through the touchscreen or the large central dial located near the gear level. There is also the option of using the pad on the wheel to write letters – perfect for when using the navigation systems – or draw shapes. Because the dial is in the centre of the car, this feature might prove a bit tricky for UK drivers, unless you’re left-handed, in which case it's on the ‘right’ side (even though it’s on your left…). There are voice commands that are activated by calling an instruction or pressing a button. There’s also gesture control, which divides people because of either its effectiveness or the fact that it springs into life when you don't want or expect it to – to change screen or control the volume. The 4 Series’ infotainment system is also compatible with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, which function wirelessly. Using the connected technologies can be clearer and quicker than the inbuilt system, although that is still impressive and very user-friendly. Meanwhile, the driver’s display is not as impressive, partly because of the rev counter that runs backwards, but also because it’s quite dark and not very pleasing to look at. Unlike in an Audi A5, you can’t change the views and the lack of personalisation marks the BMW down a bit. MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax A full complement of petrol and diesel engines are used in the 4 Series to suit a range of drivers The petrol engine range starts with the 420i, which uses a 2.0-litre engine with 184hp and returns an official average of 44mpg. Next up is the 430i, which uses the same sized engine but has 258hp and is almost as efficient at 42mpg, and finally the range-topping M440i with its 374hp six-cylinder 3.0-litre and an official 36mpg. For those looking for diesel power, the base engine is a 190hp 2.0-litre in the 420d, the most economical with an official 60mpg figure. Next up is the 430d, which uses a 3.0-litre engine with 286hp to return up to 52mpg, and an engine of the same size, but with 340hp and 48mpg, the M440d finishes the range. There’s no manual gearbox in the 4 Series, which might be a deal-breaker for some people who like to be more in control behind the wheel, although these are becoming increasingly scarce. Safety and security Safety and security When it was tested by Euro NCAP in 2019, the BMW 4 Series scored a maximum five stars. Particularly impressive was the adult occupant protection, which scored a whopping 97%. Protection for vulnerable road users was also high – at 93% – while child occupant safety was figured at 83%. For frontal crash protection, the BMW offers driver and passenger airbags as standard and knee airbag for the driver. There are side airbags for driver and all passengers, while those in the front also have chest and pelvis airbags. Other safety equipment include active bonnet, autonomous emergency braking for cyclists and pedestrians and lane assist technology. Security-wise, all models come with a Thatcham 1 alarm system, as well as an engine immobiliser. There’s central locking all round for the doors, fuel filler cap and luggage compartment. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems The 4 Series is covered by a three-year, unlimited mileage warranty, which is pretty much the industry standard, although some premium brands put a stingier 60,000-mile limit on their offerings. Other manufacturers will offer more – such as Kia and Hyundai – but BMW has so far resisted any calls to go beyond the 36 months. The coupe has been the subject of a few recalls in recent years involving various items such as brake discs and the exhaust gas recirculation cooler. BMW generally performs well in reliability surveys in the automotive industry, as you might expect for such a popular brand. However, in the odd case after it was first launched, the car struggled to impress."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/m5,BMW M5 Review & Prices,"€141,880",7/10,new,"Is the BMW M5 a good car? Is the BMW M5 a good car? Few car nameplates are as illustrious as ‘M5’ - not just a cracking bit of motorway, but BMW’s flagship 5 Series model since 1984. The latest BMW M5 (known as the ‘G90’ generation) marks a big step forwards as it’s the first time the M5 has used a plug-in hybrid powertrain. It’s like putting solar panels on your eight-bedroomed mansion - you’re not actually making that much difference to the planet, but you are unlocking numerous benefits for yourself and showing off how eco you are to the rest of the world. At the same time, you may well upset the purists who think a heat pump and underfloor heating is sacrilegious compared to a good old oil-fired Aga and some cast-iron radiators. There’s nothing backward-thinking about the new M5, though it does still have a distinctly old-school heart - underneath the batteries and motors of the plug-in hybrid system sits a 4.4-litre V8 petrol engine. This produces a beefy 585hp on its own, but combined with the whole system it produces an official 727hp (more on this later) and 1,000Nm of torque. That’s enough to give the M5 tremendous performance, despite its vast weight - at over 2,400kg, it’s heavier than a Range Rover Sport . A totally reworked suspension system with a hugely configurable set of adaptive dampers, four-wheel drive and rear-wheel steering all help to manage this weight, though. If you’re considering a BMW M5, you’ve probably got your eyes on quite a few - all hugely powerful - alternatives. For the first time in a while, you can choose from a BMW M5 as either a saloon or a Touring (estate) model - widening its appeal, and giving it even more natural alternatives. The most obvious is the Audi RS6 , though Mercedes hasn’t yet launched its halo E-Class model yet, so only the less powerful E 53 is available. It too is a plug-in hybrid, though. Other alternatives are numerous. There are luxury limos like the Porsche Panamera , but fans of practical performance are more than ever opting for fast SUVs these days - like BMW’s own X5 M Competition or the Range Rover Sport SV. There are even credible fully electric alternatives worth considering now, too, such as the Porsche Taycan , Audi RS e-tron GT , Mercedes EQE 53 or even the Tesla Model S Plaid . Outside of the engine and performance upgrades, the new M5 is very similar to the regular 5 Series - it’s even available as a Touring model for those who want a bit of extra boot space. You can tell it apart thanks to its chunky makeover, though, with wide wheel arches, new air intakes and quad exhausts at the rear. Inside, you get M-specific seats and upholstery, plus some bespoke touches to the infotainment and driver screen, but the 5 Series’ practical interior remains largely unchanged. Like the regular 5 Series plug-in hybrid, too, the M5 can be run on purely electric power, giving you the potential of some seriously low running costs - provided you can keep your foot off the loud pedal. It’s even quite a cost-effective company car, too. In the meantime, you can check out the best BMW M5 deals on Carwow, or look for other great BMW deals here. Shop for a used BMW M5 for sale , or take a look at other used BMWs for sale . And remember, Carwow can even help you sell your old car when the time comes for car-changing. How much does the BMW M5 cost? How much does the BMW M5 cost? The BMW M5 starts at more than £111,000, which isn’t bad value - no, really. An Audi RS6 is a few thousand pounds more expensive, and though the Mercedes-AMG E 53 does undercut it by a significant margin, that’s strictly speaking a car from another performance class. The Porsche Panamera Turbo E-Hybrid is far pricier, as are any fully-electric alternatives with comparable performance. You do need to put a few options on the M5 to get the best out of it, however. Adaptive cruise control being an optional extra on a car costing more than £100,000 stings in particular, and the particularly keen drivers will want to pay around £10,000 for both the carbon ceramic brakes and the lifting of the top speed restriction from 155mph to 190mph. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort Surprisingly pliant and comfortable in regular daily driving, but all that weight does impact overall fun factor The M5 is hardly any more difficult to drive in town than the regular 5 Series, and that’s very high praise. Visibility is good and the driving position is very comfortable, but what’s most impressive is that the adaptive dampers can be set to be so pliant it hardly feels as though you’re driving an M car at all. Driving through town’s even easier when you have a fully charged battery, as the M5 is a proper plug-in hybrid - BMW claims it can do over 40 miles on a charge (though you’re more likely to see around 25-30 in the real world). That’s still ample for a cross-town commute in serene silence, and you can stay on electric power all the way up to motorway speeds too. Obviously with more than 700hp to play with, the BMW M5 makes mincemeat of any motorway journey - it’s totally at home on a derestricted autobahn, after all. You’ll have no problem overtaking with impunity, or getting up to speed in the blink of an eye. It’s a shame that adaptive cruise control is an optional extra - it comes as part of the Driving Assistant Professional pack, which is about as autonomous as cars get in the UK right now. It’ll even change lanes for you. The adaptive dampers once more keep the M5 superbly comfortable, and it’s very quiet when you have it in one of the less lairy driving modes. As ever, the duality of the M5 is that it can be a serene and practical daily driver at the same time as being able to embarrass many a supercar on a twisting back road. Though BMW claims the M5 produces 725hp, we tested it on professional equipment and measured a staggering 774hp, so it’s no wonder that when you put your foot down the acceleration is ferocious - 0-62mph takes just 3.5 seconds. Better yet, the electric motor actually fills in all the gaps in the engine’s power delivery, which means you get relentless acceleration right up to the top of the rev range rather than it coming in fits and spurts. It also completely eliminates any lag you might feel from the turbocharger, too, so the M5 picks up instantly as soon as you put your foot down. It even sounds great when you rev it - not always a given with modern performance cars. A word of praise has to go to the brakes, too, which have amazing stopping power - even moreso if you opt for the optional carbon-ceramic brake package. However, the pressing issue is the M5’s weight. At nearly 2.5 tonnes, it’s actually heavier than a Range Rover Sport - part of that is down to the plug-in hybrid system, but just generally this is a very heavy car. While the M5’s myriad computer systems and trick suspension do a brilliant job of hiding that weight from the driver they also add an extra layer in between you and the driving experience and make it feel just a little bit remote. That means that while it’s fast, corners incredibly flat and can put the power down out of corners shockingly well - it’ll even go a bit sideways if you configure the systems right - it just doesn’t feel as much fun as some alternatives. An Audi RS6 or Porsche Panamera give you a greater feeling of connection to the car, as does BMW’s own smaller M3 . The other issue is the sheer number of settings you get to play around with. Forget your normal family hatchback which may have ‘Sport’ and ‘Eco’ modes - on the M5, you have myriad settings for the drivetrain, suspension, steering, four-wheel drive and brake systems. On top of that, you have to choose how you’d like the plug-in hybrid system to deliver its power and manage its battery charge. It’s a trifle overwhelming and feels like you’re ticking boxes before you get a chance to do any actual driving. Space and practicality Space and practicality Reasonable space inside and unchanged from the regular 5 Series - but you’ll want the Touring model for ultimate practicality There’s not much to say about the M5’s practicality - it’s almost identical to the regular 5 Series. The difference up front comes from the sports seats, which are big, comfortable and supportive even if you’re not as whippet-thin as a racing driver. There’s loads of adjustment in both the seat and steering wheel for drivers of all heights, though you can’t sit quite as low as you could in the previous M5 thanks to the battery pack being underneath you. Storage up front is good, with big door bins, a pair of cupholders in the centre, and a large storage bin under the armrest. There’s also a pair of wireless phone charging pads, to make the most of the car’s wireless smartphone connectivity. There’s not quite as much room in the back compared to the Audi RS6 or Mercedes E-Class, but it’s still plenty spacious enough for adults. Three can even sit across the rear bench - for short journeys, anyway - as the wide body affords them plenty of shoulder room. There aren’t any map pockets in the front seatbacks, but there are large door bins, a small storage cubby in the centre and a flip-down armrest with two cupholders. There are also USB-C charging ports on the back of both front seats, and you can option a system to provide a built-in smartphone mount, coat-hanger or folding table for rear-seat occupants. With 466 litres of space, the M5’s boot is a little smaller than the regular 5 Series, which has 520 litres. That’s still massive compared to the measly 360 litres of a Mercedes-AMG E 53, though, and beats out the 403-litre Porsche Panamera E-Hybrid too. If you want more room, the M5 Touring has a 500-litre boot plus the benefit of that larger opening and squarer roofline for carrying larger items. It’s worth noting that this is only the same size as the M3 Touring’s boot, however, and the regular M3 saloon has 480 litres of space - more than the M5. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories Comfortable and well-built but a little less luxurious than previous M5 models Again, there are few changes here from the regular 5 Series to the M5, and most of them are focused on the driver. You do get the aforementioned sports seats, which are a great upgrade, but you also get a new, sportier steering wheel. This has a flat bottom for the first time in the M5’s history, as well as a red stripe at the 12’o’clock position. There are also a pair of paddle shifters - plastic, sadly, rather than the carbon-fibre of the previous model - and two ‘M’ buttons which allow you to call up preconfigured driving modes with one click. You get the same two massive screens, a 12.3-inch one for driver information and a 14.9-inch one for infotainment. These are crystal clear and responsive but can be difficult to navigate around simply because there are so many settings to choose from. You can at least use the rotary selector on the centre console to avoid using the touchscreen on the move, though a set of proper physical climate controls would be better. Build quality is good but materials feel a little less luxurious than they used to. In some places, BMW has used artificial instead of real leather, and plastic instead of carbon fibre. The big strips of ambient lighting also contribute to an overall more plasticky feel than the old M5. MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax As a plug-in hybrid, the BMW M5 has the potential to be extremely fuel-efficient. However, it’s also a performance car, which means it has the potential to be extremely thirsty, too. Your reality will probably lie somewhere in the middle. If you regularly charge up and make full use of the M5’s electric range, you’ll see impressive economy, but that’s not really what this car is about. During a week with the vehicle we averaged 22.6mpg, which isn’t too bad and is about what you’d have expected from the last M5. Where this M5 plays its trump card is that CO2 emissions are low, regardless of how much fuel you end up using. That means a more affordable first year road tax bill, and, crucially, it falls into the 8% benefit-in-kind tax bracket for company car users . If you’re a high-earning executive, the M5 could prove a cost-effective company car, attracting about a third of the yearly tax bill that the previous model did. Safety and security Safety and security The M5 takes its crash safety rating from the regular 5 Series, which scored the full five stars in Euro NCAP testing . Impressive scores of 89% for adult occupants and 85% for child occupants give further weight to this car’s ‘family-friendly supercar’ persona. It’s a shame that some of the safety kit is an optional extra - adaptive cruise control in particular - but you do get lane-keeping aids and automatic parking as standard, plus a full suite of sensors and cameras to help you avoid kerbing those pricey alloys. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems A car as powerful and as complicated as the M5 isn’t going to be the most reliable thing in the world, and BMW sells too few to get an accurate picture of its reliability data. It shouldn’t in theory be any less reliable than the regular 5 Series, and does come with a three-year, unlimited-mileage warranty - that’s better than key alternatives, at least. Keeping your M5 religiously serviced, and making sure you don’t hoon it too hard on track will be essential to its longevity. BMW M5 FAQs BMW M5 FAQs"
https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/x5m,BMW X5 M Review and Prices,"€117,626",8/10,new,"Putting the engine from the fabulous high-performance M5 saloon into a big 4X4 is the sort of thing you might speculate about with your mates down the pub. But BMW has actually gone and done it, and this is the result, the BMW X5 M. It rivals other high-performance SUVs, like the Porsche Cayenne Turbo, Range Rover Sport SVR and Mercedes GLE63. But, it immediately has the bragging rights, as it’s the quickest of the lot. In fact, its twin-turbo 4.4-litre V8 has an incredible 567hp and 553Ib ft of torque, which is enough to propel this 2.3-tonne brute from 0-62mph in just 4.2 seconds. That’s sportscar performance in anyone’s book, yet this car is also a luxurious five-seat SUV. The price is equally shocking, but happily this expensive car comes with lots of equipment as standard, including sat-nav, adaptive dampers (that let you stiffen the suspension), and plenty of safety equipment. The cabin is awash with airbags, and you also get active cruise-control with automatic braking, automatic headlights, tyre pressure monitoring, a head-up display, adaptive LED headlights and high-beam assist. You also get a bespoke bodykit that includes aggressive exterior styling and unique dials. In other words, the looks are every bit as brutal as the performance it’s capable of. Yet, the beauty of the car is that it can be whatever you want it to be. The standard Adaptive M suspension has separate buttons for altering the steering weight, gearbox ferocity and throttle response to allow you to tailor the X5 M’s behaviour to the conditions. With everything dialled down, this is a civilised and practical day-to-day vehicle. However, choose the hooligan settings and it’s an entirely different matter entirely. It’s probably just as well that the top speed of the X5 M is limited to 155mph, because I dread to think just how fast it could go if it wasn’t If there is a downside, it’s that the BMW X5 M could get away with being a good bit less powerful, simply because few drivers could ever push this thing to anywhere near its limits. The handling of the standard X5 already does a great job of defying the laws of physics, but the X5 M takes it to another level entirely – although it’s still not quite as sharp as a genuine sports car through the bends. Oh, and there is one other possible downside: its fuel economy. Even the official figures reckon it’ll only manage 25.4mpg, so quite what that will translate into in the real world is best left to your imagination. Then again, if good fuel consumption figures were a priority, you wouldn’t be looking at the X5 M in the first place. Instead, this is an expensive SUV that is as luxurious as it is quick. It comes with Merino leather upholstery, while the graphics on the infotainment system are some of the clearest you can find on any system at any price. The BMW X5 M is also as practical as any X5, and nobody sat inside this behemoth is going to complain about a lack of leg or head room. Last, but not least, although the boot isn’t as big as you’ll find in the Mercedes GLE, it’ll still be more than enough for most people. Likewise, the boot isn’t the biggest in this sort of vehicle, but the X5 M has 650 litres of boot space, which should be enough for most families. And, if it’s not, it’s expandable to 1,870 litres if you fold the back seats down. This is the kind of thing that starts to build a case for buying the X5 M over a sports car with similar levels of performance. Just try getting five people and their luggage into something like a Jaguar F-Type, for example. For all that, it’s hard to make a case for the X5 M on purely financial terms. It’s big, brash, in-your-face and very expensive, but if you can afford one, you won’t give two hoots about the price ticket or how much it costs to keep it on the road."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/x5,BMW X5 Review & Prices,"€111,300",10/10,new,"Is the BMW X5 a good car? Is the BMW X5 a good car? There aren’t many cars that can do what the BMW X5 can do: it’s like a roomy, comfortable hot hatch on stilts. It’s genuinely enjoyable to drive, much more so than alternatives such as the Audi Q7 and Mercedes GLE . If you want to get something closer, you’ll need to head to a Porsche Cayenne , but that’s a bit like a 100-metre sprinter at a marathon – it isn’t quite as comfortable or practical for families over long distances - which helped the BMW X5 to win the Adventurer's Choice category of the 2025 Carwow Car of the Year Awards . The BMW X5 has most cars very much licked on the luxury front, though. Everywhere you prod there are luxurious materials and soft-touch plastic, from the top of the dashboard to the door tops. Sure, the overall design is slightly more conservative than that of a Mercedes GLE, but for some, that’ll be a good thing, and an update in 2023 brought a much more modern design to close the gap. You get BMW's excellent twin-screen setup on the dashboard. The curved displays look suitably modern, with the one on the right displaying all the relevant driving information and the one on the left for your infotainment. It's a touchscreen and really quick to respond to your inputs, but the menus are quite complicated to find your way around. Another important factor in a large luxury SUV is space and the BMW X5 offers plenty of it. Those in the front will have no complaints and the driver gets a supportive seat with full electric adjustment and a memory function. There’s plenty of space in the back seats, as well – two tall adults will sit comfortably behind those in the front, while a third won’t be sounding off on a long journey either. That spaciousness continues to the boot, with the X5 having 650 litres, which is a good chunk less than you get in an Audi Q7 and Porsche Cayenne, though the BMW is a bit more spacious than the Mercedes GLE. There are four engines to choose from. The plug-in hybrid will be the best option for those who can charge regularly, and it also has the lowest tax rate for company car buyers. There's a sporty petrol if running costs aren't a concern, but most people will find one of the diesels offers the best all-round experience. In town, the BMW X5, despite its size, isn’t daunting to manoeuvre thanks to good visibility for the driver through its tall wide windows and standard front and rear parking sensors. In fact, BMW includes its Parking Assistant, which will steer the car into a space for you and you can add rear-wheel steering as an option for better low-speed manoeuvrability. It’s a comfortable experience, too; the X5’s optional adaptive air suspension does a good job of soaking up ruts, potholes and broken Tarmac in its most comfortable setting. That said, the M Competition’s firmer suspension (in the name of going around corners more quickly) isn’t as comfy when the going gets rough. On twisty country roads, the BMW X5 steers with precision and on its standard suspension handles well – particularly in its firmer ‘sport’ setting. The M Competition’s still-firmer suspension props the X5 up even more effectively through bends and the range-topper is more agile to drive. But, calm things down to a cruise on the motorway, and all the engines are quiet, while wind and road noise are kept to a minimum. You do hear more road noise in the M50i and M Competition with their huge alloys and super-wide tyres, though.

This is an upmarket SUV from a premium brand, so it’s never going to be cheap. Prices start at just under £70,000, which is a bit more than an equivalent Audi Q7 or Volkswagen Touareg , and considerably more than the Genesis GV80 and Volvo XC90 . However, the Porsche Cayenne starts around £73,000 and the Mercedes GLE at £77,000. Prices climb to almost £130,000 if you go for the M Competition . Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort Quick, agile, comfortable – the X5 delivers in every way. A bit of tyre noise at high speed is the only criticism The X5 is a very big machine for town driving, but it’s not intimidating. You sit up high with a good view out, and although the rear windscreen is small the view over your shoulder isn’t too bad. Front and rear parking sensors are standard on xLine models, so there’s no excuse for any parking scrapes. You can pay extra for the BMW Parking Assistant system, which will reverse the car into a space for you, but in our experience it's not very good. The X5 comes with a smooth-shifting automatic gearbox, which makes for easy and unflustered driving in city traffic. Even the least powerful X5 is a quick car, so you can nip into any gaps. For town driving, the pick of the range has to be the plug-in hybrid 50e. This will go 66 miles on battery power alone, according to BMW’s figures. That’s a lot further than most cars of this kind, and even if you struggle to match that in real-world conditions most urban journeys can be completed without burning a drop of petrol. Every X5 makes an excellent motorway car. Strong performance is a given when even the least powerful diesel can hit 60mph in 6.1 seconds. What’s more important is the way the X5 behaves once up to speed. Engine noise stays in the background, and there’s not much in the way of wind or road noise either. Maybe there’s a bit of a rumble from the tyres but it’s not enough to be irritating. Air suspension is an optional extra worth going for, because with the car set to ‘comfort’ it delivers a silky but controlled ride that should keep car sickness at bay. Combine that with a roomy and luxurious cabin and the X5 is a pleasure to travel in on long journeys. This is where the X5 really scores over other big SUVs. It is a hoot to drive on a twisty country road. Switch to ‘sport’ mode and there’s more weight to the steering, and sharper responses from the gearbox and throttle. The suspension firms up too to reduce body lean in bends. It’s the mode to choose for maximum fun with remarkable grip and poise for a car of this size. The standard models are rewarding to drive, but the M60i and M Competition take things to another level. These deliver near-supercar levels of performance and handling, although the trade off is a less forgiving and comfortable ride. For most of us, the less expensive models are more than exciting enough. Space and practicality Space and practicality Plenty of room for five (or seven) to travel in luxury and comfort, it’s just a shame that getting seven seats is a cost option Slide into the driver’s seat and you’ll find you sit up high with a clear view of the road ahead. Even on the base model the seat adjusts electrically and has a memory function to store your ideal driving position. There’s enough movement to the seat and wheel for folk of all shapes and sizes to find a sound and supportive driving position. There’s a digital display in place of conventional dials in front of the driver. It can be configured to show different information. Being able to display a map right in your eyeline is especially useful. You want plenty of storage space? You get it. The door bins are absolutely huge, and there’s lots of space beneath the driver’s armrest. There are twin cupholders at the base of the centre console. Everything you see or touch has a quality look and feel. Yes, this is an expensive car, but when you sit behind the wheel there’s no doubt this BMW is a premium machine. The X5 seats five as standard, but seven seats are a cost option (unless you choose the 45e PHEV, which is only available as a five-seater). Go for the extra row and you won’t find as much space as in a Land Rover Discovery , but kids should be happy enough. Adults can be squeezed in for short trips but won’t look forward to long journeys. The second row of seats is much roomier. There’s enough width to the cabin for three to travel in comfort without too much rubbing of elbows. If we're being picky, it's a shame these seats don't recline like in an Audi Q7. If you often travel with children rather than adults, the ISOFIX mounts have flip-up covers which keep things neat when they aren’t being used. Wide-opening rear doors mean lifting a bulky child seat into the cabin shouldn’t be too much of a struggle. With the optional third-row seats in place, there’s enough boot space for a weekly shop rather than a family holiday. In the five-seat X5 or with the third row lowered, the boot is huge. The capacity is 650 litres, which means give or take a few litres there’s as much room for bags in the back of the X5 as you’ll find in a large estate car . The exception is the plug-in hybrid, which has a lower 500-litre capacity. That’s still a reasonable size, though. It's worth noting that most alternatives offer more capacity, though. The Mercedes GLE has less space at 630 litres, but the Audi Q7 (740 litres), Porsche Cayenne (772 litres) and Volkswagen Touareg (810 litres) offer more. The X5 has a split tailgate, which means the lower portion folds down rather than up. It makes for a useful seat if you are changing in or out of wellies, for example. Removing the parcel shelf is easy, and in most models there’s space to store it under the floor. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories Clever infotainment and a superb standard of finish, but remember the connected services tech is only free for the first three years You pay big bucks for the X5, but you can see where the money goes when you sit inside. This is a beautifully made car. You get a vegan-friendly leather alternative as standard, but you can opt for leather if you prefer, although the fake stuff does a more than passable impression of the real thing. Prod the dashboard and doors and you’ll find the materials are soft to the touch, and everything feels made to last. The quality of the cabin really is exceptionally high. Some will prefer the more minimal look of the Volvo XC90’s interior, but the updated interior design means that the BMW X5's interior looks much more simple and modern than before. The curved displays are the central feature and they work really well for the most part. It can be a bit tricky to find your way through the complex menu settings though, and it's a shame you have to control the climate settings through the screen, even if they are always present at the bottom of the main display. The screen itself is crisp and clear – you really can’t fault the display. What’s more, it’s compatible with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto , so you don't have to mess around with BMW's own system for the most part anyway. Every X5 comes with a suite of connected services, with the long-winded name of BMW ConnectedDrive Online Services. This includes the virtual personal assistant who listens to you bark orders, and over-air software and map updates. A three-year subscription is included, after which you need to pay. MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax Of the four engines on offer, the plug-in hybrid is a no-brainer for those looking for a company car . It uses a 3.0-litre petrol engine and a battery-powered electric motor to provide a healthy 489hp, but because its CO2 emissions are so low it's in a cheap benefit-in-kind tax band. And the excellent 66-mile electric-only range means that your running costs will be super-low if you can keep the battery topped up. If running costs are less of a concern than outright performance, the M60i is your best bet. It uses a 4.4-litre V8 engine that makes 530hp, which is sports car power. You're looking at fuel economy of just 24.4mpg, though, and its high emissions mean it's in one of the highest first-year Vehicle Excise Duty bands. Most people will be best-served by one of the two diesels. There's a 298hp 30d model and a 352hp 40d. We tested the 30d and found it to be more than powerful enough, and we actually saw better economy than the official figures at 39mpg. Don't be scared off by diesel, because it's actually great in big, heavy SUVs such as the X5. Safety and security Safety and security The X5 is a very safe car, with a five-star rating from the safety experts at Euro NCAP . It scored 89% for protecting adult occupants, 86% for children, 75% for pedestrian protection and 75% for its safety assistance systems. Standard safety kit includes active cruise control , which maintains a safe distance to the vehicle in front, as well a speed limit info display and tyre-pressure sensors to warn the driver if one of the tyres is deflating. Active Guard Plus is also standard, which will apply the brakes in an emergency if the driver fails to do so, and this system includes a lane departure warning feature. All X5s have an alarm and immobiliser, as well as Legal Emergency Call for summoning help after a collision, even if the driver is unconscious. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems This generation of X5 is still quite a new car, so there’s not an awful lot of hard data as to its reliability. The previous model tended to achieve mid-field respectability in reliability surveys, which is often the case for BMW. So we wouldn’t expect too much trouble, but if you really want to go through your motoring life with no unscheduled trips to the dealer, then no luxury brand builds more dependable cars than Lexus ."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/m3,BMW M3 Review & Prices,"€109,346",9/10,new,"Is the BMW M3 a good car? Is the BMW M3 a good car? The BMW M3 is a high-performance saloon alternative to the Audi RS4 , Mercedes-AMG C 63 and Alfa Romeo Giulia Quadrifoglio . It’s the original and still considered the best by many, loved for packing so much pace and excitement into a sensible, family friendly body. The latest generation has more power and luxury than ever, but that might not matter to you one jot if you take one look at it and don’t like what you see... There’s more to the outlandish styling of the BMW M3 than just the ‘kidney’ (maybe lungs would be more appropriate) grille. Huge intakes sit either side of the bottom of the front bumper, while down the side swollen wheel arches make it stand out from a regular 3 Series . In fact, the only bit of bodywork shared with the standard car is the boot lid — though here it has a spoiler tacked on top. You’ll see a quad-exit exhaust sat below a chunky diffuser, and happily, those huge tailpipes are real. You have the option between two alloy wheel designs as well, with the front pair 19 inches and the rear 20 inches in size. You can also choose to have lots of the exterior details clad in carbon fibre, although this is a pricey option. You’re not going to mistake the BMW M3 for a run-of-the-mill 3 Series inside, either. It’s covered with M-coloured stitching, M-badges everywhere and if that wasn’t enough, it’s like somebody spilt a large mug of carbon fibre all over the place. A thick model-specific steering wheel features, as well as standard electrically-adjustable sports seats that come with illuminated M logos, though you can opt for figure-hugging carbon fibre bucket seats if you want a feel more akin to a racing car. This version of the BMW M3 is a bit longer than the old car as well, so there’s more room in the back. Legroom back there is pretty good, and there’s more headroom here than the equivalent M4 as a result of the saloon body style. You could easily use this as a family car. You get a fantastic new infotainment system on a 14.9-inch screen, it’s intuitive and dead easy to use, plus there’s support for Android Auto in addition to Apple CarPlay . Both can be connected wirelessly, as well. In front of you, there’s a 12.3-inch digital drivers display for key driving info, and this has some customisation to it too, including racy-looking M-specific displays. It’s not the most configurable or exciting-looking instrument display in the business, however. There’s a reasonable amount of boot space in the BMW M3, with 480 litres. That’s identical to the outgoing car, though those after a bit more room will be happy to know there's also an M3 Touring available in an estate body style. If you’re buying a BMW M3 though, you’re likely most interested in its performance — and this latest version has bags of it. Its 3.0-litre twin-turbocharged straight-six engine is good for 510bhp and 650Nm of torque in Competition form (which is all you can get in the UK), sent to the rear wheels through an eight-speed automatic gearbox. It fires the M3 from 0-60mph in 3.9 seconds and on to a 155mph limited top speed. You can get that raised to 180mph either as a standalone option or as part of a package that also includes carbon-ceramic brakes, but it’ll cost you £8,000. Gulp. Another option you can get on the M3 for the first time ever in the UK is an xDrive version. This brings in the same switchable four-wheel drive system as you’ll find on the M5, allowing you to have the security of all-weather traction mixed with the ability to switch back into rear-wheel drive for some hooliganism. When you’re driving it hard, the M3 doesn’t feel quite as spiky and unpredictable as the old car — largely in part because of impressive levels of grip all-round. It feels sharper than the likes of the Audi RS4, yet not as intimidating as the outgoing version. It’s even less spiky in the four-wheel drive version, which rivals the Audi for storming all weather, all season pace. This is more than just a brutal performance car though and does the normal stuff pretty well. Switch everything into Comfort mode and you can cruise along pretty pleasantly enjoying lighter steering, though the suspension still has a pretty firm edge to it at low speed. As you probably would with your other half’s surprise tattoo, you can probably look past the looks and appreciate the BMW M3 for the impressive performance car it is. You might even grow to like the styling, too. Want one? Check out our BMW M3 deals page to get the best price, or browse the latest used M3s available from a network of trusted dealers. You can also browse other used BMWs , and carwow can even help you sell your car online . How much is the BMW M3? How much is the BMW M3? It’s not only the power, size and weight of the new BMW M3 that has increased; its price has also seen a hike. It costs more than the Alfa Romeo Quadrifoglio and Audi RS4 in ‘base’ rear-wheel drive trim and can breach the £100,000 mark once you add all-wheel-drive, carbon ceramic brakes and a host of other aesthetic and luxury features. That said, it’s already very well specced as standard and is arguably the most talented sports saloon in its class, and, optioning up any of its alternatives results in similarly inflated pricing. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort The BMW M3 is fantastic to drive on a twisty road, but it's pretty uncomfortable over bumps in town Being based on a family-friendly saloon car pays dividends when it comes to daily usability, and while its dimensions have grown, the new M3 is still perfectly suited to pottering around town. The suspension can be unyielding over bumps at low speeds, but you have an unobstructed view out from the multi-adjustable driver’s seat and the gearbox, brakes and steering all feel light and accurate. The BMW M3 comes with the Parking Assistant package as standard, providing help when parallel or reverse parking, through a multitude of sensors and an impressively detailed rear-view camera. The M3’s bumpy slow-speed ride quality smooths out as the speeds rise and it cruises along just as serenely as a regular 3 Series, unless of course you mash your foot to the floor when its sporty engine and exhaust note permeate the cabin. The large tyres can transmit some road noise into the cabin, but it's still impressively refined and very comfortable. Weighing 150kg more than the outgoing M3 may have you thinking that the new model would lose its composure when it came to twisty roads, but you’d be wrong. Thanks to a very well sorted chassis the rear-wheel-drive M3 exhibits very precise and sharp handling characteristics that can be further fine-tuned using the configurable M mode. The switchable xDrive all-wheel-drive model adds additional grip in slippery conditions giving you the sort of all-weather performance that was once the sole preserve of Audi ’s top RS models. The optional Carbon Ceramic brakes offer fade-free braking performance, and you can even have your drifting skills assessed by the onboard computer – at the safety of a race track of course. Space and practicality Space and practicality The M3 saloon may be a thrilling sports car, but it easily seats four and has plenty of space for luggage, too. Five adults would be a squeeze though Storage space for the two occupants up front is generous, with a pair of cupholders in front of the gear lever and a space for your mobile phone that also provides wireless charging. Two wide and deep door pockets will take additional cups and water bottles. The centre armrest opens up to reveal a deep storage area, making up for the rather puny glovebox, which is a bit too shallow. The standard electric driver’s seat is supportive with plenty of adjustment to suit most shapes, and for even more support you can opt for the M carbon bucket seats which hold you in place like a vice grip once you hoist yourself over the substantial side bolsters. We’d save the money and stick with the standard sports seats if you aren’t planning to regularly attend track days. Thanks to decent leg and headroom, three adults can fit in the rear. Although, the two outer seats offer sculpted backrests making them more suitable for long trips, and an empty centre rear seat means that its backrest can be folded down to be used as an armrest and a receptacle for a pair of coffee cups. Easily accessible ISOFIX anchor points are situated in the two outside seats, and the door pockets are big enough for even large water bottles. With 480 litres of boot space, the M3 will take just as much luggage as a regular 3 Series and matches the Alfa Romeo Quadrifoglio as well. The Audi RS4 Avant takes 15 litres more but is available solely as an estate and is more comparable to the M3 Touring. The new Mercedes C-Class offers 455 litres, but the AMG C 63 has a bit less because the hybrid system's batteries are stored beneath the boot. An electric bootlid is available as part of the Comfort Pack package and the Extended Storage package which incorporates bag hooks, side nets and a 12V power socket is fitted as standard. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories The latest wide screen infotainment system and plenty of sporty ‘M’ design touches typify the M3’s cabin. Just beware as it’s not hard to push the price up by dabbling in the options list The M3’s interior is typically well built with great quality materials and some sporty touches that help separate it from the rest of the 3 Series range. These include the optional M Carbon bucket seats, M-specific steering wheel with its two red ‘M’ buttons and a model specific gear. You can further customise the interior with a selection of two-tone leather upholstery and Carbon Fibre trim. The updated 12.3-inch driver display is fully customisable and offers M-specific visuals but can be a bit confusing to read at first glance. The new 14.9-inch infotainment touchscreen is a revelation though; it doesn’t look quite as impressive as Mercedes ’ large portrait display but is arguably more intuitive to use and offers all the connectivity and features you could possibly want or need. The navigation system is much improved, but you can still use Google Maps or other third-party apps thanks to standard Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. You can use the iDrive control, voice commands, touchscreen or even hand gestures to access the various functions. We found ourselves using the touchscreen while stationary and the controller when on the move. An optional Drive Recorder can take a video of the exterior environment to be played inside the car or exported to an external device. USB and USB-C sockets are provided up front, with wireless connectivity and charging for mobile phones and the obligatory 12-Volt socket between the cupholders. MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax The M3 is offered solely in top Competition guise in the UK, that means that its twin-turbocharged 3.0-litre six-cylinder engine develops 510bhp and rockets the rear-wheel-drive model to 62mph in 3.9 seconds. That’s on par with the Alfa Quadrifoglio and quicker than the Audi RS4’s 4.1-second effort. If you opt for the xDrive all-wheel-drive version, then the 0-62mph time drops to what was a class-leading 3.5 seconds. The new Mercedes-AMG C 63 S promises to complete the same sprint in 3.4 seconds thanks to its 680hp hybrid engine. While the 155mph limited top speed is unlikely to be troubled on British roads, you can increase your bragging points by adding the M Driver’s Pack which increases the top speed to 180mph, and it also includes an M Intensive Training BMW Driving Experience course. For what it’s worth, the rear-wheel-drive M3 officially manages 28.8mpg in combined driving, roughly matching the Alfa and Audi. Making liberal use of the performance on offer will quickly see this figure tumble. The Benefit-In-Kind tax rate is 37% and the official CO2 emissions figures range between 223-230g/km depending on wheel and drivetrain choice. Safety and security Safety and security The BMW M3 has not undergone a Euro NCAP test but the 3 Series on which it is based scored a full five-star rating. The 97% score for adult occupant safety is particularly impressive. The M3 should fare even better when it comes to safety as it comes standard with LED headlights as well as advanced parking and driver aids that are only optional on most lower-spec 3 Series models. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems The BMW M3 is offered with a three-year, unlimited mileage warranty with an option to extend it up to a maximum of 100,000-miles. Service plans and roadside assistance programmes are also offered by BMW. The current M3 is relatively new to the market so its long-term reliability is yet to be established. There have been two recalls so far, one for an incorrectly tightened seatbelt assembly and the other for a driveshaft component that may not be sufficiently durable."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/5-series,BMW 5 Series Review & Prices,"€82,023",9/10,new,"Is the BMW 5 Series a good car? Is the BMW 5 Series a good car? Think of an all-rounder, and two things are likely to spring to mind. First will be a Swiss army knife – the global icon for ‘a thing that does everything’ – and the next could well be the BMW 5 Series. Since debuting five decades ago, this posh German saloon has proven time and again that it can offer comfort, bags of practicality, the latest technology and serious performance. It’s a similar story with its two key alternatives – if you’re considering a 5 Series you should also take a look at the Mercedes E-Class and Audi A6 . Or perhaps the Lexus ES if you want a left-field option. The latest 5 Series clearly takes hints from BMW’s recent bold design direction as seen on the likes of the 2 Series Coupe and XM , albeit a little more subdued. That said, its styling is rather challenging, lacking the elegance of its predecessors. There are odd, incohesive lines around the headlights and front bumper, a front grille that seemingly mimics beaver teeth and the rear end looks like the designers couldn’t agree on what to do so gave up halfway through the process. It’s a different story inside, with BMW’s latest infotainment system present and correct, combining a 12.3-inch digital drivers’ display with a 14.9-inch central screen. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are included as standard, and operate wirelessly. The overall design is pretty good and although some of the physical buttons have disappeared, forcing you to use the touchscreen more, there are high quality materials and solid build quality to make up for it. Artificial leather upholstery comes as standard, though you can opt for the real stuff, as well as a part-Alcantara choice if you’d prefer. So you get all the good tech, but if practicality is key, you might be a touch disappointed. Petrol-powered versions of the new 5 Series promise 520 litres of boot capacity, which is less than the Mercedes E-Class and Audi A6, though not by much. On the plus side, unlike those two cars the BMW’s boot doesn’t lose capacity in the plug-in hybrid version. A Touring estate version will arrive later if you need the extra room. The BMW 5 Series is available with one petrol engine, offering 208hp, and a pair of plug-in hybrid versions with up to 489hp. Notably, there’s no diesel version, which is a sign of the times given that this model is typically popular with those who rack up serious motorway mileage. It’s goodbye to diesel, but hello to electric for the first time in a 5 Series. The i5 – reviewed separately here – will do up to 361 miles on a charge, but is quite a bit more expensive than the petrol-powered model. As you might expect, the BMW 5 Series is a comfortable and refined motorway cruiser. There’s a little bit of wind and road noise but overall it’s a relaxing way to rack up miles. However, BMWs usually excel at also being great fun on a twisty road, but the latest 5 Series is a bit disappointing in this regard. The steering is numb and doesn’t give much feedback about how much grip the tyres have, while the car just generally lacks the eagerness to turn into a corner that made old versions so much fun to drive. An Audi A6 is, surprisingly, more fun here… Regardless, this is a great all-rounder and just a fraction better overall than the Mercedes E-Class and Audi A6. Want one? Check out the latest BMW 5 Series deals available through Carwow. You can also see how much you could save on a used 5 Series from our network of trusted dealers, as well as other used BMWs . You can sell your car through Carwow, too. How much is the BMW 5 Series? How much is the BMW 5 Series? The BMW 5 Series starts at just over £50,000 for the petrol-powered 520i. This quickly rises to almost £60,000 for the 530e plug-in hybrid, or over £76,000 for the more powerful 550e. All start with the M Sport trim, but for an extra £3,000 can be upgraded to M Sport Pro, bringing larger 20-inch alloy wheels, gloss black styling touches, and an illuminated front grille surround. To give you some context, that’s marginally more affordable than the Mercedes E-Class, which starts at £55,000 but in its most powerful, top-spec, plug-in hybrid guise will set you back over £85,000. The Audi A6 is generally cheaper, starting around £45,000 and rising to nearly £70,000, but it is showing its age now. It’s worth noting that the all-electric BMW i5 starts around the same price as the 550e plug-in hybrid, making the electric version particularly enticing for company car buyers who will see ultra-low benefit-in kind rates. In M60 trim the i5 starts at just under £100,000 though, which feels like a lot of money for a 5 Series… Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort The BMW 5 Series is quiet and refined for long motorway drives, but not as fun as you would expect a BMW to be in the corners The BMW 5 Series is pretty easy to drive around town because the steering is light and there’s good visibility all around. It can feel pretty big on particularly tight streets, but you do get a 360-degree camera as standard to help you judge the car’s extremities. The 520i isn’t particularly powerful, but it’s got enough grunt for pootling around town, and the gearbox is quick-witted enough to let you take advantage of gaps in traffic. However, one of the plug-in hybrids will be better-suited here because you can glide around silently on electric power. Comfort is impressive, too. It doesn’t glide across surfaces with the refinement of the E-Class, but there’s really not much in it. You just feel a few sharper bumps such as potholes more than you would in the Mercedes. While there’s a hint of sportiness in the way you feel the odd lump and bump in the road at slower speeds, it’s not as noticeable at motorway speeds. There’s a small amount of wind and tyre noise, but you’d have to be incredibly picky to complain about it. Again, the Mercedes E-Class feels a bit more luxurious on a long drive, but the difference isn’t huge. Rather disappointingly, you only get regular cruise control as standard, with adaptive cruise control being part of the Technology Plus Pack, which also adds a head-up display to help you keep your eyes on the road ahead. BMW has a reputation for making comfy, upmarket cars that are also great fun when you find yourself on a twisty stretch of Tarmac. However, the latest 5 Series lets the side down a bit. For a start, the steering is rather numb, so you don’t get much feedback about how much grip you have. Related to this, the car doesn’t feel particularly keen to turn in unless you really chuck it about, but even then you don’t have much confidence in the car holding onto the road. The 520i lacks the power to accelerate quickly out of corners, too. The result is that, while the car is composed on a twisty road – the body doesn’t wobble about when you turn and the suspension soaks up bumps nicely – it never puts a big smile on your face. Surprisingly, an Audi A6 is actually more enjoyable. Audis have a reputation for being safe and reliable more than fun, but the A6 is more responsive to your steering inputs and feels more agile in turns than the 5 Series. Quattro models have excellent all-wheel drive grip, too. Space and practicality Space and practicality Passengers will find the 5 Series roomy inside, but there’s not as much storage as alternatives Drop into the front seats of the BMW 5 Series and you’ll find it’s plenty spacious enough, and there’s a lot of adjustability in the driver’s seat and steering wheel to get comfortable, even for taller drivers. Storage up front is decent, with door bins that are big enough for a large bottle of water, while in the middle is a pair of cupholders and a wireless phone charging pad for two phones beneath the dashboard. The armrest has some extra space inside, and it has a split opening so the driver or passenger can easily access it. Useful storage, then – but there are more and bigger cubby holes in both the Audi A6 and Mercedes E-Class. You can plug two phones directly into the car with two USB-C slots up front, and there’s a 12V socket, too. Space in the back is really good, with loads of legroom and headroom. However, while you can fit your feet under the seat in front, there’s not a huge amount of space down there. At least the wide body means you can fit three across the back a bit more easily than in the A6 and E-Class, while the middle-seat passenger has a comfy cushion, too. Storage is again only so-so. It’s odd that there are no map pockets in the back of the front seats, and the door bins are okay – you can comfortably fit a couple of small water bottles inside. There’s another small storage compartment between the front seats, and there are two cupholders in the centre armrest. A useful addition is a USB-C slot in the back of each of the front seats, so there’s no arguing over who gets to charge their iPad… At 520 litres, the BMW 5 Series has a pretty big boot, though it is the smallest out of its key alternatives, with the Mercedes E-Class getting 540 litres and the Audi A6 having 530 litres. There’s not a great deal in it then, and all should have enough space for most people. Where the BMW does have an advantage is that there’s no space penalty for the plug-in hybrid, which has the same 520-litre capacity. The Audi and Mercedes both drop to a measly 360 litres in hybrid form. There’s no load lip to lift heavy items over and the space is a useful square shape so it’s not too tricky to pack lots of items in. However, the saloon body style means the opening isn’t particularly big, so bulky items can be rather awkward to fit inside. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories Well-built with quality materials throughout, though the infotainment isn’t the easiest to use While the exterior design might be rather challenging, no such complaint can be thrown at the interior. It’s dominated by that huge curved twin-screen setup that sits on the dashboard, which has allowed most of the physical buttons to be removed and their functions inserted into the infotainment screen. That’s not ideal, because although the likes of the climate settings are always visible at the bottom of the display, it’s not as intuitive to use on the move as a bank of physical switches. It’s a similar story with the rest of the infotainment setup. The main screen is huge at 14.9 inches, with crystal clear graphics and it’s very quick to respond to your touch, but there are so many settings and menus it can be difficult to navigate your way around them. At least there’s a rotary dial beside you that can make it easier to change settings while you drive. It’s not quite as visually impressive as the optional triple-screen setup in a Mercedes E-Class, but largely works a bit better. For example, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connect seamlessly and use up the whole screen, unlike in the Mercedes. Furthermore, your phone maps also show in the 12.3-inch digital instrument display that’s behind the wheel, which is an excellent feature you don’t see very often. Away from the tech, the 5 Series interior is generally high quality, with squishy plastics in all the important places and a feeling of solidity. It maybe doesn’t quite have the pizazz of the E-Class, and like that car there are a few bits that feel rather cheap considering the price. However, both feel plush and high-tech compared with the ageing Audi A6. MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax The BMW 5 Series range opens with the 520i, which uses a 208hp petrol engine and sees fuel economy of up to 48.7mpg in official tests. If you’re looking for the most affordable all-rounder as a private buyer, it’s probably your best bet. However, there’s also a pair of plug-in hybrid engines, both of which are available with either rear-wheel drive or all-wheel drive. The 530e makes 299hp, while the pricier 550e makes a healthy 489hp. If economy is your focus then go for the 530e, largely because it has less power so should be a bit more efficient. It also has a slightly longer electric-only range of up to 63 miles, compared with the 550e’s 56 miles. Having impressive electric range contributes to wild fuel economy figures of up to 470mpg in official tests, but you will only hit these sorts of numbers if you keep the battery regularly topped up and do shorter journeys. Something like 60mpg is probably more realistic, but we’ll put this to the test soon… For company car buyers who want a combustion-engined 5 Series, these hybrids will be your best bet thanks to the lower Benefit-in-Kind rate than the petrol. However, as an electric car, the i5 has a rock bottom company car tax rate that makes it all the more appealing. Hybrids also have lower car tax than petrols, while electric cars pay no Vehicle Excise Duty at all. Safety and security Safety and security The BMW 5 Series scored the full five stars in Euro NCAP safety testing, with impressive scores across the board. It was rated 89% for adult occupant protection, 85% for child occupants, 86% for vulnerable road users, and 78% for its safety tech. Standard assistance kit includes cruise control, lane-keeping and a system that will park the car for you. You can also pay extra for the Technology Plus Pack, which includes adaptive cruise control with a stop and go function in slow-moving traffic, as well as a warning to help avoid cyclists and pedestrians. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems This generation of BMW 5 Series isn’t old enough to get a clear picture of its reliability. BMW doesn’t have a brilliant reputation for reliability, though it’s far from the worst, and the outgoing 5 Series was known for largely avoiding issues. All new BMWs come with a three-year, unlimited mileage warranty. However, if reliability is a key concern, Lexus has a fantastic reputation, and its warranty can be extended up to 10 years with annual servicing."

The BMW 1 Series is a posh family hatchback with a high-quality cabin and loads of cutting-edge tech. You may also be considering the Audi A3 or Mercedes A-Class if you’re shopping for a premium hatchback, and the 1 Series was updated in 2024 with a new look and an updated cabin. The 1 Series has always been the go-to if you want a premium hatchback with a sporty edge. It’s a bit like choosing a pair of Yeezys over some Dr. Marten loafers. There are very few small cars which feel as posh inside as the BMW 1 Series, and this was only improved during the 2024 update. All the materials feel soft and yielding and everything is really solid. Quality in here is much better than it is in a Mercedes A-Class. The tech you get inside is also really impressive. All cars get a huge curved display atop the dashboard comprising a 10.7-inch touchscreen and a 10.3-inch digital driver’s display, and it’s all very responsive and easy to use. As is the case in most BMWs the driving position is spot on. There’s loads of adjustment in the seats and steering wheel for all drivers big and small to get comfortable. Once you’re ready to go, there are also plenty of cubby holes for you to empty your pockets into. Moving to the rear seats, the space on offer is best described as adequate. If you’re only carrying two people back there then they’ll have enough legroom, however headroom could be a struggle for taller adults. Getting three people back there is also a tight squeeze, and a Volkswagen Golf is more adept at carrying rear passengers. Boot space is also down on some of this car's key competitors. In the basic petrol model you get significantly less space than an Audi A3 or Honda Civic have to offer, however the BMW’s load area is a nice square shape and there isn’t much of a lip to haul items over. As for engines, there are just three on offer and they’re all petrol-powered. Entry-level models get a 1.5-litre three-cylinder with 170hp, then there’s a 2.0-litre with 218hp or the range-topping M135 hot hatchback with 300hp and all-wheel drive. Once you’ve loaded the car up and hit the road, the first thing you’ll notice is that even the entry-level petrol model has a hot hatch feel to it. The steering is responsive and it’s great fun to thread down a country road, though the performance-focused M135 isn't as exciting as the Volkswagen Golf R, even if there's no denying it's fast in a straight line. The sportiness does come at the expense of comfort though, because even the normal 1 Series is a bit firmer than an Audi A3. This is especially apparent around town, where the car jitters around over potholes and broken surfaces. Still, at least the steering is nice and light and you get decent all-round visibility. Things settle down on the motorway, where the cabin feels nice and hushed. There’s just a hint of tyre roar disturbing the peace, but the 1 Series is a relaxing car for covering long distances. So the BMW 1 Series is great to drive, packed with tech and really well-made. Some alternatives are more comfortable though, and quite a lot of features are pricey options. Check out the latest BMW 1 Series deals if you fancy this as your next car and want to save some cash, or browse offers on other BMW models . You can also take a look at used 1 Series’ available now, and don’t forget that you can also sell your current car through Carwow for a great price. How much is the BMW 1 Series? How much is the BMW 1 Series? The BMW 1 Series starts from roughly the same price as a Mercedes A-Class, and it’s a touch more expensive than an Audi A3. However, costs begin to mount up once you start ticking boxes on the options list. All cars come with a 10.7-inch touchscreen, a digital driver’s display, LED lights and 17-inch alloy wheels as standard. If you step up to the M Sport model you then get 18-inch alloys, more aggressive styling, adaptive suspension and sports seats. If you want keyless entry, that’ll either cost you £520 or you can get it as part of a £1,500 technology pack which also includes adaptive LED headlights and power-folding mirrors. Automatic air conditioning is also a £480 option, which feels a bit mean on a car this premium. Adaptive cruise control will also set you back £1,700, something you’ll want if you do a lot of motorway miles and a feature that a Honda Civic gets as standard. Once you get to the range-topping M135 model it looks very expensive indeed, especially as the interior doesn't feel quite posh enough for the price, and you're still missing some kit you'd expect for the money. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort Even in basic form the 1 Series feels like a hot hatch to drive, however it’s not as comfortable as some alternatives Around town the 1 Series is pretty easy to drive. All cars get an automatic gearbox as standard so stop-start traffic isn’t too much of an issue, although it can be a little slow to respond when you put your foot down unless you’re in sport mode, which is annoying if you’re trying to nip out at a junction. The suspension is also quite firm and jittery at low speeds, with large potholes sending a thud through the cabin. An Audi A3 is more comfortable for bumbling around town. It’s easy to manoeuvre though thanks to the light steering and decent visibility, with just an over-the-shoulder blind spot causing problems while parking. This is easily remedied with the standard-fit reversing camera, although if you want the really handy 360-degree camera system you’ll have to pay £2,750 for the Technology Plus Pack. You may want to go for that pack if you struggle with parking though, because it also includes an automatic parking feature which will get you both into and out of tight spaces, as well as a reversing assistant which can retrace your steps backwards to get you out of a tricky situation. At higher speeds that firm suspension smooths out nicely, and it’s a relaxing car to cover long distances in. There’s very little wind noise entering the cabin, although there is a bit more tyre roar than you get in a Volkswagen Golf. Adaptive cruise control is a pretty pricey option if you want to take the sting out of a long drive, however it’s well worth it if you spend a lot of time on the motorway. It’ll steer to keep you in lane and maintain a safe distance from the car in front of you. It’s on a winding back road that the BMW 1 Series really shines. It may not be rear-wheel drive like 1 Series of old, but it’s still great fun to chuck around corners. That firm suspension does a great job of eliminating body roll, and the steering is really responsive as well. The Audi A3 is still more comfortable if you just want to relax and waft home, but the BMW can settle down nicely when you don’t feel like being a hooligan. Despite this, the M135 model isn't actually as much fun to drive as alternatives such as the Honda Civic Type R and Volkswagen Golf R . It's fast and perfectly capable of going round corners quickly, but the brakes are too squidgy, the steering gives little feedback about what the front tyres are doing and the gearbox is a bit slow to respond. You just don't get the urge to have fun on a twisty road, which sort of defeats the object of this model. Space and practicality Space and practicality There’s loads of interior storage in the 1 Series, but the rear seats are a bit tight and the boot isn’t massive There’s loads of space up front in the BMW 1 Series, and all drivers will be able to find their ideal driving position because there’s plenty of adjustment in the seats and the steering wheel. You also get an abundance of cubbies to keep your bits and bobs out of harm's way. The door bins will easily swallow a large bottle with room to spare, and you get a decent-sized glove box. There are a couple of cupholders in front of the gear selector and there’s even more storage under the armrest. Charging your various devices is no bother either. All cars get two USB-C ports up front and a 12 volt socket, and a wireless charging pad can also be added as an option. Moving to the rear seats the 1 Series is fairly average. Kneeroom is decent, however headroom could prove to be a bit tight for taller adults. It’s a squeeze to get three in the back as well because of the way the roof curves in at the sides. The boxier VW Golf is better for carrying three. Fitting a baby seat is easy though. The doors open wide enough to get it in without too much faff, and the ISOFIX anchors are really easy to access. There’s just about enough room for a rear-facing seat as well without pushing the front chairs forward. Storage in the back seats is good as well. You get a couple of cup holders in the centre armrest and door bins which will fit a large bottle. Rear passengers won’t be fighting over charging points either thanks to the two USB-C ports. The amount of boot space you get in the 1 Series changes drastically depending on what engine you go for. The standard 1.5-litre and 2.0-litre petrol are mild hybrids, and so there are batteries under the boot floor which means you get 300 litres of space. The M135 on the other hand doesn’t have the electrical gubbins to contend with, and as such it gets 380 litres of space. With 300 litres on offer the 1 Series is 80 litres down on an Audi A3 and it has 50 litres less than a Mercedes A-Class. If maximum boot space is a priority for you, then the Skoda Octavia has 640 litres on offer. With the seats folded you get 1,135 litres to play with in the mild hybrid models, or 1,200 litres in the M135. You can get through loading thanks to a 40:20:40 folding rear seat, and they lie almost flat so loading heavy stuff towards the front is easy. You also get a couple of bag hooks to stop your shopping from rolling around. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories The 1 Series has one of the most premium-feeling cabins in its class and technology is great, however some of the controls are a bit fiddly The BMW 1 Series has an interior which feels like it’s from a much larger car thanks to the excellent build quality and posh-feeling materials. Everything feels properly solid and there are plenty of soft touch plastics around the place. You can also get some funky-looking ambient lighting which livens things up a bit. The overall design may not be as interesting as a Mercedes A-Class, but the BMW blows that car out of the water when it comes to build quality. All cars get a 10.7-inch touchscreen infotainment system as standard, and it’s pretty easy to use. Some of the menus are a tad confusing, but the screen itself is bright and responsive and you’ll probably just use the standard-fit Apple CarPlay or Android Auto most of the time. It’s a shame that BMW has done away with the swivel wheel in the centre console, because that was much easier to use on the move than prodding around at the screen. You do get voice commands though which work well. The standard-fit 10.3-inch digital driver’s display is also very good, with plenty of options to customise it as you want and it’s really easy to read at a glance. As part of the 2024 update, the 1 Series also now does without physical climate controls. This is a shame because the ones you use through the touchscreen are much trickier to operate on the move. On the whole though, the 1 Series has one of the best interiors in this class. MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax The engine lineup for the 1 Series is very simple, because there are just three to choose from. All of them are petrol powered, there are no diesels on offer, and there’s no manual gearbox option anymore either. Check out an Audi A3 if you want a posh hatch with a third pedal. The entry-level car has a 1.5-litre three-cylinder engine with 170hp, and it’ll be more than sufficient for most people’s needs. It’ll do 0-60mph in 7.8 seconds so it feels nippy enough, and it’ll return up to 52mpg. There’s also a 2.0-litre model with 218hp which does 0-60mph in 6.3 seconds, and has a claimed economy of 48mpg. Of those two engines the basic 1.5-litre unit is your best bet for the added economy, but if you want proper hot hatch thrills then you’ll need the M135. That car has a 300hp 2.0-litre engine with all-wheel drive, and it’ll do 0-60mph in 4.9 seconds. The M135 will cost you a lot more in road tax for the first year than the other two models, with a bill of £1,095 compared to £220 for the 1.5 and £270 for the 2.0-litre. With no plug-in hybrid or electric models on offer here, company car buyers may want to look elsewhere to get lower benefit in kind rates . Something like a Cupra Born may be a better bet. Safety and security Safety and security The BMW 1 Series scored the maximum five stars when Euro NCAP tested it back in 2019, however the updated 2024 model hasn’t been put through its paces. This doesn’t matter too much though because the car’s basic structure is the same as before, so you can rest assured that it’ll protect you and your family well if the worst should happen. To prevent an accident from happening in the first place, all cars come with autonomous emergency braking, a reversing camera and rear parking sensors. Adaptive cruise control is an expensive option to add, but it does make motorway cruising less stressful. The 360-degree camera and parking assist options are also worth going for to keep you safe from those pesky curbs and bollards. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems The previous generation 1 Series was rated highly for reliability in numerous surveys during its production run, and the new model has continued this trend and has regularly outscored other compact premium offerings in its class. It comes with a three-year unlimited mileage warranty, which can be extended for up to 100,000 miles after the initial three-year period. There are three levels of cover from fully comprehensive to a basic driveline option which covers the main engine and driveline components for work up to £5,000. You also get a 12-year anti-corrosion warranty as standard. BMW 1 Series FAQ BMW 1 Series FAQ"
https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/m4-convertible,BMW M4 Convertible Review & Prices,"€115,982",8/10,new,"Is the BMW M4 Convertible a good car? Is the BMW M4 Convertible a good car? The BMW M4 Competition Convertible is kind of a car without many alternative options at the moment. With Mercedes still to produce a proper AMG version of the new CLE convertible , and Audi just taking the RS5 out of production, the M4 is the only way you can take four people and luggage out for a high-speed run, and not have to buy a Porsche or Ferrari . It’s kind of like a four-wheeled Barry Manilow — big nose, big talent, and designed for the California lifestyle. Yes, that nose is still there, although we’re kind of starting to warm to it after a few years of familiarity. The huge ‘kidney’ grilles (if those are the kidneys, what must the pancreas look like?) aren’t what you’d call elegant, but in the right colour (please, not Sao Paulo yellow…) they don’t seem to look quite so bad these days. Aside from the nose, you can tell the M4 Competition apart from a regular BMW 4 Series Convertible thanks to the extra little vents on the front wheel arches, and the big diffuser poking out from beneath the boot, with four massive exhaust pipes (which, thankfully, are real pipes and not stuck-on fakes). As standard, the alloy wheels are ‘staggered’ meaning that they’re 19-inch rims up front, and 20-inch wheels down the back. You can choose from six different wheel designs, two of which are no-cost options. If you’re going to buy a BMW M4 Competition Convertible, you’d better like carbon-fibre as it’s pretty much everywhere on the inside. There’s acres of the stuff on the dashboard, the centre console and the doors. Other M-specific touches are a thicker three-spoke steering wheel with a butter-soft leather rim, a bright-red starter button, and the handy little M1 and M2 driving mode memory buttons on the steering wheel. The standard sports front seats are great, and while you can spec carbon-fibre backed racing-style bucket seats, you probably shouldn’t — they’re rock hard, and come with a hard slab of carbon fibre right at the edge of the seat base which is in a very, er, delicate position. The back seats are pretty small, and while the M4 Coupe actually has reasonably practical space in the back, the room turned over to the convertible top means that here in the Convertible, the back seats are more upright and more cramped. That roof is a proper fabric one — much nicer than the heavy folding-metal roof on the previous M4 model — and it retracts in just 18 seconds, which you can do at speeds of up to 31mph. The dashboard of the M4 Competition Convertible is dominated by the big, sweeping digital screen — actually two screens in one mounting, a 12.3-inch instrument panel for the driver, and a 14.9-inch touchscreen infotainment system. That bigger screen comes with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto , but while the on-screen menus look good and are reasonably easy to find your way around, we’d love a few more physical buttons. Boot space is only OK. Compared to the useful 440 litres offered by the M4 Coupe, the Convertible has only 300 litres when the roof is folded away, although you do get a little more when the roof is up. It’s still not what you’d call massively spacious, though. The M4 Convertible is massively fast, though. The twin-turbo 3.0-litre straight-six petrol engine develops a whopping 530hp, which is enough to fling it to 62mph in just 3.7 seconds. The top speed is, in theory, limited to 155mph, but if you tick the options box for the M-Driver pack (which includes a complimentary training session with BMW M-Sport) then that can be raised to 173mph. Handy if you’re popping to Germany for a holiday… Standard four-wheel drive means that the M4 Convertible is a true all-weather device, and feels secure and planted even in the most treacherous conditions. It does mean that it feels a fraction less lively than the old rear-wheel drive model, but there is a two-wheel drive mode deep in the on-screen settings menu. BMW has stiffened up the structure a bit to cope with the loss of the steel roof, but it’s definitely not quite as sharp as the Coupe. That said, the M4 Competition Convertible is still a smooth enough car to be able to use as a daily driver, and if you switch it all into Comfort mode, then it’s actually quite refined. In fact, it’s so talented a car — with all that summer-time headroom and fresh air — that you might even grow to like the looks, too. If you do, check out the latest BMW M4 Convertible deals to see how much you could save. You can check out our latest deals on other BMW models here, or find a used BMW for sale here. And remember that Carwow can even help you sell your old car when the time comes. How much is the BMW M4 Convertible? How much is the BMW M4 Convertible? Given that it doesn’t have any true direct alternatives right now, the M4 Competition Convertible is… just kinda priced, really. It would be more expensive than an Audi RS5 Convertible but that’s not in production anymore, while the incoming Mercedes CLE 63 AMG is likely to be a pricier car by a good margin. The M4 Competition also finds itself sandwiched roughly half-way in price terms between a Porsche Boxster 4.0 GTS and a 911 Carrera Cabriolet . Neither have the power nor speed of the BMW, but both are more engaging to drive. The M4 is well-equipped, but it’s irritating to note that things like automatic high-beam headlights and keyless access are on the options list. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort The BMW M4 Convertible is massively entertaining to drive, but still usable daily - the loss of the roof means it’s not as much fun as the Coupe, though The BMW M4 Competition Convertible comes as standard with adaptive suspension, and adjustable weighting for the steering. So, when you set everything to the softest mode, it’s actually a reasonably comfortable car to drive around town. OK, so there’s still an underlying sense of firmness, and those big low-profile tyres will smack hard into a speed bump if you’re not paying attention, but it’s not too trying. That’s the point of a BMW M-car — performance with usability. Things become problematic when there’s not much room to manoeuvre. The M4 doesn’t have great steering lock, so it needs to make big, wide turns which isn’t ideal. There’s a very good surround-view camera system, which does help, but the poor rear visibility when you’ve got the convertible roof up is deeply unhelpful. Sharply angled junctions end up being pure guesswork, as it can be really hard to see over your right shoulder. 530hp means that the BMW M4 Competition Convertible gets up to fast-flowing motorway speeds with the merest flex of your right foot. In fact, it’s so fast through the gears that you’ll need to be wary that you don’t overstep the speeding line too much. Once you’re cruising, the standard sports front seats are very comfortable for a long journey (much more so than the optional carbon-backed bucket seats) and the radar cruise control and lane-keeping steering can help to take the strain off the driver. There’s an optional Driving Assistant option, which ramps up the abilities of those two systems if you’re a regular long-haul driver. On concrete sections of motorway, those big tyres will drum up a fair amount of roar, and of course the convertible roof means that there’s a bit more wind noise than you’d get in the Coupe — even if the soft roof is beautifully lined and drum-tight waterproof. The suspension is never anything other than firm, but it would take a really rough patch of motorway to make it uncomfortable, while the four-wheel drive keeps everything nice and stable. As long as you don’t mind the lofty fuel consumption figure, the M4 Convertible is actually quite a good long-haul companion. Are twisty roads where the M4 Competition Convertible was born to be? Maybe so, but the fact is that the loss of the roof — and the bit of body stiffness that goes with it — means that the Convertible is noticeably softer-edged and a little less precise to drive than the Coupe. If it’s precision that you want, go for the M4 Coupe or even the smaller, slightly lighter M2 instead. The M4 Convertible is more about getting the roof down on a sunny day, and listening to the sweet sounds of that straight-six engine as it powers you from corner to corner. It’s a lovely way to get about the place, but perhaps not the best solution for the truly keen driver. The standard xDrive four-wheel drive means that traditional British B-roads with traditional British cow pats and traditional British rain are no enemies to the M4 Convertible, and even with that 530hp on tap, you can easily put all that power to the road. Sport mode stiffens up the suspension and steering, but actually for our tight, twisty, and bumpy roads Comfort mode is better for the suspension, with Sport for the steering and gearbox. Thankfully the near-enough endless driving modes menu on that big screen means you can set things up just as you like them, and then save your favourite settings to the handy little M1 and M2 buttons on the steering wheel. You can even alter how fast and sharp the gear changes in the eight-speed automatic gearbox are, which is just as well as they can feel a bit lazy at times. Actually, it’s a shame that we Brits don’t get the option of an M4 with a six-speed manual gearbox — that would be ideal. True, a Porsche 911 Carrera Cabriolet would be more fun on a twisty road such as this, and its engine sounds even better, but then it’s also significantly more expensive and actually slower than the BMW. Space and practicality Space and practicality No shortage of room in the front - but the back seats are for occasional use only Even tall drivers will get easily comfy in the front of the M4 Competition Convertible. Those big front seats are excellent, and both supportive when you’re cornering hard, yet squishy-comfy when you want to sit back and relax. The driving position has plenty of adjustment although the seat doesn’t quite feel perfectly lined up with the steering wheel. There’s decent storage space too, with good-sized cupholders in front of the gear shifter under a big carbon-fibre (of course) hinged cover. There’s a wireless mobile phone charger in there too. The door bins are fine, and there’s a storage space — a slightly shallow one — under the front seat armrest. Space in the back of the M4 Competition Convertible is not very good. The backrest of the rear seats is more upright — damn near vertical — than it is in the Coupe, to make space for the roof folding mechanism, so that means anyone sitting in the back is going to be sitting bolt-upright. There are only two seats in the back, separated by a leather hump with an inset storage tray. Legroom isn’t terrible, especially if those in the front are prepared to budge up a bit, but the rear seats feel claustrophobic when the roof is up. The M4 Coupe’s boot is really quite big — 440 litres, even if it is a bit shallow — but the Convertible loses quite a bit of space to the roof and its folding mechanism. With the roof up, there’s 385 litres of space to play with, or about as much as you’d find in a VW Golf hatchback. With the roof down, though, there’s less space as there’s a moving panel into which the fabric of the roof rests when it’s tucked away. That cuts your boots space to a mere 300 litres. There is at least a load-through hatch for long, slim items. The M4 Convertible’s cabin looks expensive but the touchscreen can be fiddly The M4 Competition Convertible uses — as is M-car tradition — basically the same cabin as the regular 4 Series. That’s good, because the 4 Series’ cabin is a nice thing, but BMW goes to some lengths to make sure you never forget that you are in the full-on M-car. There are M logos almost everywhere you care to look, and multi-coloured stitching — in the classic red, purple, and blue of BMW M — on the seatbelts. Even the front seats get a light-up M-logo on the backrest, while the bright red engine start button hammers home the M-ness of it all. The standard high-backed bucket front seats are something close to glorious in how comfortable they are, even on a very long journey. They’re the perfect halfway house between a tightly-embracing racing seat and your sofa at home. There are more hip-hugging carbon-backed bucket seats available, but these are tighter, harder, and make it tricky to get in and out so deep are their side bolsters. They also have a massive chunk of carbon trim in a delicate spot between your legs. Ouch. The digital dashboard works mostly well, although the on-screen menus in the big screen can be fiddly at times, and some more physical buttons wouldn’t go astray. It’s annoying that BMW binned the physical air conditioning controls in favour of on-screen buttons, but left the space in the dash where the old buttons used to be… There’s a myriad of M-specific graphics and screens, and some shortcut buttons on the centre console that allow you to quickly access things like Sport mode and switch the exhaust loudness on and off. MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax The M4 Competition Convertible goes one mile less on a gallon of fuel than the Coupe — 27mpg versus 28 mpg. That’s according to the official WLTP economy and emissions test, but of course that’s going to vary quite a bit according to how you drive. It’s far from impossible to tickle 30mpg or even slightly better out of an M4 Convertible on a gently-driven cross-country run. Drive it as an M-car is meant to be driven however, and you’ll quickly be doing worse than 20mpg. Single-digit fuel consumption is possible if you’re on a track day… CO2 emissions of 231g/km put the M4 Competition into the second-highest road tax bracket of £2,340 plus the £410 levy for having a price above £40,000. BIK costs for business users start at £549 per month. Safety and security Safety and security The BMW M4 Competition Convertible hasn’t been tested on its own by Euro NCAP, but the regular 4 Series Coupe gets a maximum five-out-of-five stars, with a very impressive 97 per cent rating for adult occupant protection, 83 per cent for child occupant protection, 93 per cent for vulnerable road users (an exceptional score), and 72 per cent for its electronic safety systems. Annoyingly, if you want your M4 Convertible to be as safe as possible, you’ll have to spend considerably more than standard, as the likes of the uprated Driving Assistant safety pack, and adaptive LED headlights are only available as part of a £2,675 option pack. The M4 Competition comes with an alarm and an immobiliser, but fitting a tracking device to a car as desirable as this would definitely be advisable. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems There just aren’t enough M4s on the road — Coupes or Convertibles — to get a good feel for how reliable this specific model is. In general, BMW has a good reputation for quality and reliability, and there’s the fact that M-models get a little more specialist attention as they come down the production line, as befits a flagship model. That said, the M4 Competition Convertible is a high-end, high-performance machine, so it will need suitable, regular maintenance and will get through expensive items such as its sporty tyres and brake pads pretty quickly. BMW finished a reasonable 14th — just above mid-table — in the most recent Auto Express Driver Power survey, which is a good result, but which does put it one place behind Alfa Romeo(!) two places behind Lexus, and four behind Jaguar. Reliability was OK, according to owners (better than Mercedes’ anyway) although some 21 per cent of owners reported problems with their cars. BMW M4 Convertible FAQs BMW M4 Convertible FAQs"
https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/2-series-convertible,BMW 2 Series Convertible Review and Prices,"€39,672",7/10,new,"The convertible BMW 2 Series is a great-looking and fun-to-drive open-top, with all the style and panache of alternatives like the Audi A3 Cabriolet. It may have expensive additional extras and cramped back seats, but there’s no doubt that you’ll have fun with this car when you’re behind the wheel. At the front, there’s the usual BMW scowling headlights and iconic ‘kidney’ grille. The grooved doors lend a sporty look to the sides, while the rear is angular and modern, completed by that singular chrome exhaust pipe. Things take a turn for the worst when you put the roof up, though. The soft top looks uneven against the smooth lines of the rest of the body – it’s a bit like doodling a beanie hat onto the Mona Lisa. The interior of the Convertible is mostly good, too, taking many cues from the regular BMW 2 Series Coupe. The build quality is magnificent all-around, with everything feeling well-put-together, while the dashboard is intuitively laid out. However, space in the rear seats is limited, to the point where a full-sized adult would struggle to squeeze into the back. However, if you’re in the market for a sporty, performance-orientated convertible such as this, the back seats probably aren’t high on your list of priorities. If you just treat the 2 Series like a two-seater for yourself and one passenger, you won’t find any problems. I had a lot of fun with this car. It drives well (even though the regular 2 Series is a little better) and looks amazing. The top-of-the-range trims can get pretty costly, though. The 2 Series Convertible’s infotainment is your standard BMW fare, using the firm’s iDrive system. You get a 6.5-inch digital screen with satnav, automatic emergency services alerts and a DAB-, CD player- and MP3-compatible radio. Other features found on every model include automatic air conditioning, automatic headlights and a Bluetooth hands-free system. Forking out an extra £1,000 for the Sport trim will give you sports seats and let you select driving modes, adjusting the steering and suspension for Sport, Comfort and Eco functions. The M Sport trim goes even further by improving the suspension, enlarging the wheels and reupholstering the steering wheel. The top-spec M240i’s biggest change is swapping the standard engine for a turbocharged, six-cylinder petrol, armed with 340hp and a 0-62mph time of five seconds – but you pay an awful lot for the improved performance. Both petrol and diesel engines are available, with the latter being more economical, yet also noisier, cramping the otherwise sporty image of the 2 Series Convertible. Driving the convertible 2 Series is a good time all-around. From the steering to the gear changes – whether manual or automatic – to the suspension, everything feels smooth, fluid and unintrusive. While the stiffer 2 Series Coupe still feels slightly better to drive, the Convertible doesn’t give too much away and feels more agile than an Audi A3 Cabriolet. And while the car’s folding roof might not be beautiful to behold, it does do its job well. It can shift position in less than twenty seconds and still works in speeds of up to 31mph. So, if you’re on the hunt for a sleek, cool convertible that drives and handles well, the BMW 2 Series is well worth looking at. Make sure to check out our deals pages for the best prices."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/x6,BMW X6 Review & Prices,"€116,815",9/10,new,"Is the BMW X6 a good car? Is the BMW X6 a good car? The BMW X6 is a bit like Snapchat. When it first appeared, people wondered what the point was. Does anybody need a car that’s part SUV, part coupe? But like Snapchat, the X6 has defied the naysayers to prove quite popular. This large coupe-style SUV has strong engines and seating for five. It’s a sleeker version of the BMW X5 and an alternative to the similarly-styled Mercedes GLE Coupe and Porsche Cayenne Coupe . The X6 has been updated for 2024 but you still get the classic, chunky proportions that you expect from an off-roader, with a rakishly angled roof that echoes the sleek lines of a sports car . As is the trend in recent BMWs, the trademark ‘kidney’ grille is now enormous. It’s also available with illumination, to make it even more, er, eye-catching. Inside the look and feel is very BMW X5, which is a good thing. It has an interesting design but functional button layout and everything feels extremely well put together. It also means you get BMW’s latest twin-screen infotainment system, which looks amazing although some functions are harder to use than before the latest update. There are good and bad points to the X6’s space and practicality. Okay, so you’ll seat four adults just fine inside, but the X6 loses some rear headroom in the name of style compared with the X5, plus its middle seat is quite uncomfortable. The boot is smaller than an X5’s (and the Mercedes ’ or Porsche ’s) and a more awkward shape thanks to its sloping roofline. You’re paying a premium over the X5 for this, remember. There’s a choice of petrol and diesel engines, but the highlight of the range is the performance-focused M60i. This twin-turbo V8 petrol has 530hp and a 0-62mph time of 4.3 seconds. The X6M Competition gives you more power (625hp) for a 0-62mph time of 3.9 seconds. That’s staggering pace for a car of this size and weight, but it is even more expensive to run than the M60i and requires more compromise to comfort. Even the entry-level engines are extremely strong, and given the diesel is the cheapest and most fuel-efficient of the range it makes the most sense. Whichever engine you choose, the X6 feels bulky but comfortable in town and more agile than it has any right to be on a country road given its size. On the motorway, it’s supremely comfy and quiet with the latest driver assistance tech available. The BMW X6 is a mixed bag, then. It’s superb to drive, has a lovely cabin and an eye-candy infotainment system. You’re better off just spending less money on the more practical X5, though, unless you really prefer the X6’s styling and don’t need the space. If that’s the case, you should check out the latest BMW X6 deals on Carwow to see how much money you can save. You can also browse the latest used BMW X6 stock, as well as other used BMWs . When the time comes, you can sell your current car through Carwow , too. How much is the BMW X6? How much is the BMW X6? The X6 costs more than the equivalent X5, which is all but indistinguishable to drive and much more practical than the X6. As for similar cars, the Mercedes-Benz GLE Coupe starts from a higher price than the X6, while the Audi Q8 range is also slightly more money when comparing entry-level models. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort Staggering performance, great handling and surprising comfort, but visibility isn’t great for town driving The high driving position ought to give a good view out. The trouble is the huge pillars front and rear restrict your view. It doesn’t help that there’s no wiper for the rear windscreen, so you can’t see very well out of the rear-view mirror on a wet day. A clever automated parking system should take the strain out of finding a space for such a big car with iffy visibility, but in practice it’s not as clever as it’s cracked up to be. You’ll probably rely on the car’s sensors and cameras instead. Although care is needed to pilot the X6 through city streets, the turning circle is reasonable by super-tanker SUV standards. It shrinks a little further if you have an X6 fitted with rear-axle steering. Whichever model you go for, the X6 is quite firm over bumps but not bum-numbingly so – you can take the kids to school without bouncing their phones from their hands. Every X6 has more than enough performance for nipping into gaps in traffic, so you don’t have to worry about going for the entry-level engines if you’re tempted by their better economy figures. You’ll be up to the legal maximum in no time in any X6 – or well beyond it if you aren’t paying attention. These are all very fast cars. For UK roads with a 70mph limit, there’s no sensible reason to look beyond the entry-level engines – the diesel in particular makes the smartest choice for long-distance driving. It will go much further between fuel stops than the thirstier V8 petrols. Comfort improves at speed, with an excellent balance between soaking up bumps without becoming too wobbly like some luxury SUVs. Stick to the ‘comfort’ setting to keep the suspension supple. There’s not much road or suspension noise on the motorway. Although there is a little bit of wind noise from around the door mirrors, it’s not enough to really disturb the peace. Big SUVs should not be this much fun on a country road. The X6 puts similarly sporty 4x4s in the shade with its agility, poise, and balance. For maximum fun between the corners, the M60i and X6M Competition are mind-bendingly fast, so it’s just as well the brakes are strong enough to cope. In truth, every version of the X6 will please keen drivers, although the V8 cars are that bit more special. We found it best to set the adaptive suspension to comfort, even with the other settings at their sportiest. That way you can enjoy rapid gearn changes and weighty steering with suspension that’s forgiving enough to cope with British B-roads. Space and practicality Space and practicality Comfortable in the front, but there are compromises in the back and the boot The X6’s driving position is super-comfy. Whether you are popping to the shops or driving halfway across the country, you should step out of the BMW without any aches or pains. There’s plenty of adjustment to the seat and wheel, so people of most shapes and sizes should be able to dial-in their ideal position. Electric adjustment of the driver’s seat is standard, as is heating. There’s a decent-sized cubby under the armrest. The lid is split in two, opening on both sides which makes it easier for someone sitting in the back to reach in if they need to. There’s a USB port inside, too. Ahead of the arm rest, you’ll find twin cupholders. On some versions they are heated for your morning coffee and chilled for a cold drink on your way home. Big door bins have plenty of room for a large flask, although you may find the cupholders are big enough. Even the insides of the door bins are made of top-notch materials, underlining the sense of luxury in the X6’s cabin. There’s lots of legroom in the back. Headroom isn’t too bad either, although there’s more in the X5 with its more conventional roofline. It’s annoying that the bases of the front seats are so close to the floor, which makes it hard to slide your feet underneath. The floor itself is higher than you’d expect, pushing your knees up and giving less under-thigh support. The middle seat is definitely the least comfortable. It’s more of a perch than a chair you sink into. We’ve found the back seats in the Audi Q8 to be more comfy. On the other hand, fitting child seats using the supplied ISOFIX mounts is very easy, thanks in part to the wide-opening rear doors. If you want to load all the way to the roof, then the sloping shape of the X6 does eat into the available space. Then again, when loading to the parcel shelf there’s a healthy 580-litre capacity. That’s some way off the 655 litres in a Mercedes GLE Coupe, mind you. There’s a load lip to lift items over, which is a bit of pain given the boot floor is so high off the ground. With the optional air suspension fitted, the back of the car can be lowered to make this less of a problem. You can fold the back seats down to make more space, although it’s odd that there are no remote release levers by the tailgate, so you have to reach in or walk around. There’s only a slight slope to the floor with the back seats lowered. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories Superb quality and stunning infotainment, but there are a few usability frustrations Before the 2024 update, the X6 was a pretty special car inside, and changes to the cabin have given it even more visual appeal. The first thing to strike you is the twin-screen display. There’s one driver’s display and one infotainment screen, but BMW has cleverly designed them to seem like one big screen. If the high-end TV in your living room looks this good, you must have spent serious money. The next thing is the sheer quality of the cabin. It’s almost impossible to find any surface that doesn’t look or feel upmarket. Even areas which most manufacturers neglect, such as the side of the transmission tunnel, are high quality. The headlining feels soft and expensive too. Is it normal to start rubbing the headlining? Probably not, but if that’s your thing you won’t be disappointed. The cabin is stylish as well as beautifully made, with BMW’s usual driver-focus but with a high-tech look which makes the pre-update car’s cabin seem dated. It’s not just that the materials are posh, they seem to have been screwed together to last for years and years to come. This is one solidly built car. And yet… somewhere along the way some ease of use has been lost. You used to be able to adjust the distance to the car in front while using the adaptive cruise using buttons on the steering wheel. Now you have to wade through the touchscreen’s convoluted menus – not something you want to be doing at 70mph on the motorway. The infotainment may look amazing, but it now includes the air conditioning controls. These were easier to use when there were separate physical buttons. So, the cabin is stunning, and the twin-screens have huge showroom appeal. But in the quest for a clean and uncluttered design, BMW has made the car less easy to use. MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax The X6 is not the car to choose if you want rock-bottom emissions. Although some engines use mild-hybrid assistance to improve economy and reduce emissions, there are many SUVs with the greener credentials and lower tax bills. For long-distance economy, there’s little need to look beyond the excellent 30d. This returns 39.8mpg according to the official figures and emits 187g/km of carbon dioxide. Even though it’s the most efficient model in the range, it’s still in the 37% band for benefit-in-kind tax – that’s as high as they go. The more powerful 40d emits 191-199g/km depending on the exact spec, while the 40i emits 195-202g/km. If you are seriously considering the M60i or X6M Competition, then you probably aren’t too worried about fuel bills or company car tax. The M Competition is the thirstiest of the lot, returning 22.2mpg and emitting 288g/km. If you use the performance, don’t be surprised to see fuel economy in the teens. Every X6 is a country mile beyond the £40,000 Vehicle Excise Duty threshold. For private buyers, that means you have to pay extra in years two to six. That’s no different from the X6’s alternatives, so it’s unlikely to sway your decision one way or the other. Safety and security Safety and security The safety experts at Euro NCAP haven’t tested the X6 specifically, but it’s really an X5 dressed for a night out. So, it’s fair to expect it to protect occupants just as well as that model in a crash. The X5 scored the full five stars when tested in 2018. It earned an 89% rating for adult occupant protection, 85% for child occupants, 86% for pedestrian protection and 78% for its safety assistance systems. Driver assistance features include the Driving Assistant Professional package, which has some extra features on top of the regular adaptive cruise control such as the ability to let the car take control in stop-start traffic. You also get self-parking tech, but it isn’t as clever as you’d hope. There’s also a Trailer Assistant for easier manoeuvres while pulling a caravan or horsebox. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems BMW tends to be in the middle of the pack when it comes to owner satisfaction and reliability surveys. There’s quite some variation between different models. The X6 is too niche to appear in many studies, but the X5 generally performs pretty well. There are reports of some issues with the bodywork, but otherwise the car is generally robust. We’d expect much the same of the similar X6. If you want zero issues with your luxury SUV, though, take a closer look at the Lexus RX ."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/m3-touring,BMW M3 Touring Review & Prices,"€127,507",9/10,new,"Is the BMW M3 Touring a good car? Is the BMW M3 Touring a good car? The BMW M3 Touring is a car almost perfectly designed for petrolheads. It’s fast, it’s fun, it’s an estate car , and it’s not really all that practical for day to day life. It’s kind of like trying to do the weekly shop by driving a go-kart around the aisles of your local Tesco — fun at first, but you soon start to realise it’s not all that sensible. There are some other options in the hot estate class, too, such as the now-sadly-departed Audi RS4 Avant and the Mercedes-AMG C63 Estate and the much smaller, but still rapid CLA AMG 45 Shooting Brake . There’s also some internal competition from the BMW M340i Touring , which is slower, but rather more affordable and useable without sacrificing too much fun. Look at the M3 Touring from the square-on at the front, and you won’t see any difference compared to the M3 saloon . There are the same massive nostril grilles (which were once incredibly ugly but which now seem to be mellowing a bit) and the same deep front bumper and air intakes. A 2024 update brought with it some minor tweaks under the skin, but the only discernible changes are the narrower LED running lights, flat-bottom steering wheel and the latest generation iDrive infotainment system - complete with its curved screen setup. Down the sides, while the estate bodywork is clearly lifted from the standard BMW 3 Series Touring, the M3 Touring has clearly been hitting the gym to bulk up those wheel arches, and there’s a massive rear diffuser with four exhaust tips around the back. You can slather lots of the outside with carbon fibre if your chequebook runs deep enough. The Touring shares all of its mechanical bits with the M3 Competition saloon , so there’s the same 3.0-litre twin-turbo straight-six petrol engine, which has recently been upgraded to 530hp as standard (up from 510hp before), with standard xDrive all-wheel drive. If you’re feeling a bit fruitier, you could go for the M3 Touring CS, introduced after the 2024 update. It gets another 20hp, bringing it to 550hp, along with tweaked suspension, gold alloy wheels and those iconic CS yellow LED headlight details - as well as a very flash carbon fibre bonnet. As with the saloon, four-wheel drive is now standard, with the old rear-wheel drive model having been dropped. The four-wheel drive system does have a sneaky cheat switch though, which allows you to lock it into rear-drive mode for tyre-shredding skids, but maybe leave that setting for when you’re on a race track, eh? Either way, you can’t do that with an Audi RS4. The M3 Touring’s suspension comes with adaptive suspension dampers, so when you set those to the softest setting, it’s actually fairly comfortable in day to day driving, with just a bit more stiffness over bumps than a standard 3 Series. The view out, especially over the shoulder, is good and there are plenty of parking sensors and cameras to make in-town manoeuvres that bit easier. Inside, the M3 Touring is basically the same as the saloon, so you get the same big sweep of digital dashboard with its massive screens, and the same very high quality construction. There’s lashings and lashings of carbon fibre, and you can have the same carbon-backed bucket seats as you can get in the saloon. These clamp you in place like a racing seat, but they’re not quite as comfy on a long drive as the standard chairs. The big curved screen has impressive software, but BMW has been steadily stripping out physical buttons from the 3 Series’ interior, so there are no longer any proper air conditioning switches, and that makes things more annoying to use than they should be. A Mercedes C-Class has a cabin and screen that’s easier to get used to. Space in the back seats is good, and basically the same as that of the saloon model, just with a little bit more light coming in through the extra window. The reason for buying the Touring over the M3 saloon is, of course, the boot space which is 500 litres, 20 litres more than you get in the saloon, and five litres more than in the old Audi RS4 Avant. The M3 Touring also keeps the classic separate opening tailgate glass, sadly dropped by the new M5 Touring , which is really handy. You can check out the latest deals on a new BMW M3 Touring now, or have a look at used M3 Tourings – or other used BMW stock – from our network of trusted dealers. And don't forget you can sell you car online through Carwow too. How much is the BMW M3 Touring? How much is the BMW M3 Touring? The M3 Touring is actually kinda reasonably priced, if a car that costs slightly more than £90,000 can be described as such. With the sad demise of the Audi RS4 Avant (and no sign of a new RS5 Avant on the horizon just yet) the only real competition that the M3 Touring faces is from Mercedes. The comparable C63 S estate has way more power than the M3 (680hp) but it costs almost £10,000 more too, and it actually has only a four-cylinder engine with the rest of the power and torque coming from a plug-in hybrid system. That compromises the C63 in terms of sound, but also in terms of boot space. A better bet might actually be the outgoing CLA 45 AMG Shooting brake, which is a smaller car, but still has a big boot, is searingly fast, and yet much more affordable than the M3 Touring. You could also, of course, consider a nearly-new Audi RS4 Avant, but at this price level, a lightly-used V8-engine RS6 Avant also comes into play… Just also remember that the M3 Touring’s starting price is just that — there’s a long and ruinous options list to go through too. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort The stiffer suspension is surprisingly comfortable around town, but tyre noise at 70mph could become annoying over long distances With a practical performance car, you want it to be relatively easy to live with in day-to-day driving to make the most of what it offers. What’s the point in a fast estate if the ride is so bone-shakingly stiff you can’t bear to take it to the local IKEA? Fortunately, the M3 Touring does a good job of smoothing out bumps in the road. Sure, it’s not as comfortable as the regular model, but nor does it skip across the surface like a stone on water. There are different suspension modes, and we’d recommend sticking to comfort, otherwise every speed bump and pothole will make you wince. Just remember that the CS model is even stiffer again, but actually its ride comfort hasn’t suffered all that much. You can raise the seat high, even with the figure-hugging carbon bucket seat, so visibility is good looking forward. It’s pretty clear out the back, too, even if the rear window looks like it’s in a different postcode. The M3 Touring’s wide body kit makes it a little more intimidating to drive in narrow spaces, and those 20-inch rear, 19-inch front, alloy wheels are a constant source of kerb-strike anxiety. However, the suite of sensors will warn you if you’re getting too close, making busy streets easier to navigate. It's on the motorway where the M3 Touring loses a few marks. Tyre noise is pretty intrusive in the M3 saloon, but it’s worse still in the Touring. Perhaps it’s because there’s more space for it to echo around? Both the Audi RS4 and RS6 are a much better option for those who will do a lot of long distance driving as they’re a bit more comfort-focused. If you’re committed to a fast BMW estate, the aforementioned M340i Touring will also appeal thanks to its increased refinement. That being said, the M3 Touring’s seats are very comfortable. Even the optional carbon bucket seats we tested should keep you free of back pain and a numb backside, even if their primary purpose is gripping your sides in corners. The standard seats have a little more ‘give’ for the huskier driver… Despite being a heavy old beast – at 1,825kg much lighter than the hefty new M5 hybrid, but still weighty by any standards – the M3 Touring is at home on a twisty road. It hides its heft incredibly well, with the direct steering making it easy to place in a turn. It genuinely feels like a sports car. Just one you could move house in. Don’t be tempted to switch to the Sport/Sport+ suspension settings here, though. Comfort mode is firm enough to offer that sports car feel on UK roads while also having enough slack to deal with bumps in the road. The Tarmac needs to be race track smooth to take advantage of the stiffer settings. If you can stump up for the carbon pack – a £7,000 extra, see what we mean about options driving the price up? – then those bucket seats are a boon when in maximum attack mode. You can adjust the side bolsters until they give you a metaphorical bear hug during hard cornering, so you have confidence to make the most of the M3 Touring’s performance. Space and practicality Space and practicality The rear seats are more spacious than those in the saloon, but the boot doesn’t have the jump in capacity you might hope for There’s plenty of adjustability for the driver, with the seats and steering wheel offering lots of movement so you can find a great driving position. The steering wheel gets two M mode switches that allow you to load two different setups, for example one for fast road driving and another for the track. As standard you get carbon fibre lashed all over the place to give off a proper race car feel, while M logos are dotted around to remind you you’re in something a bit special, just in case all that carbon hadn’t caught your eye. The rear seats are comfortable to sit in and there’s loads of room for adults. There’s more headroom than the saloon, so if you regularly carry passengers that could be another tick in the Touring’s box. Legroom is also decent, but if you get the carbon bucket seats it’s even more spacious, which is a good head-over-heart excuse to go for that option. They’re also lovely to look at, making long journeys in the back a bit more bearable. The key selling point for the M3 Touring is its extra load-lugging ability. Truth be told, the 500-litre boot capacity is maybe not as much of a jump as you might expect from the saloon’s 480 litres, but the opening is much more square, making it easier to load large items. The rear seats can be dropped using handy electric switches, opening the boot to reveal 1,510 litres of space – so much better than the paltry 320 litres (seats up) and 1,335 litres (seats down) offered by the hybrid Mercedes C63. With the seats folded down there’s no lip, so if you’re loading flat pack furniture in the back it’s easy to push it through to the front seats. Careful if you’ve got the carbon buckets, though, as they could be easy to damage if heavy items bang up against them while you’re driving around. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories The large, curved screens look fantastic, but the system isn’t as easy to use as that in the old car If you're sat in the front, the M3 Touring is no different to the saloon. That means you get the huge, curving infotainment and instrument displays with their extra M-specific screens and settings. These screens are made up of a 14.9-inch infotainment screen and a 12.3-inch driver’s display. The screens are crystal clear and the menu design is ultra-modern, but they’re not quite as intuitive to use as the old system especially now that there are no physical climate control buttons. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are included as standard, so they’re your best bet for audio and navigation. The M Drive Professional apps are a neat addition. They allow you to record lap times and compare them with previous efforts. There’s also a drift analyser that scores your sideways efforts out of five stars. MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax The 3.0-litre petrol engine has an official fuel economy figure of 27.4mpg, which is actually pretty respectable for a big, heavy car with 530hp. During testing we saw about 21mpg, which isn’t quite as good, but then it is hard to resist being heavy with the throttle pedal in a car that goes this well. CO2 emissions sit at up to 235g/km. The M3 Touring CS is slightly worse off, with fuel economy of 26.9mpg (officially) and CO2 emissions of 238g/km, but neither will make much of a difference to your overall costs. The M3 Touring falls into one of the higher first-year Vehicle Excise Duty bands because of its high emissions — £4,680 — while its purchase price means it also faces the over-£40,000 premium between years two and six after registration — and extra £425. If you’re a company car buyer, you’re looking at BIK costs of around £540 a month for the M3 Touring, and up to £750 a month for the M3 Touring CS. Safety and security Safety and security There’s the usual suite of driver assistance systems present and correct here, such as lane departure warning , lane change warning and rear collision prevention, which use cameras around the car to spot trouble and avoid or mitigate any incidents. Disappointingly, although this is an £90-odd-thousand car to start with, you only get regular cruise control as standard. Adaptive cruise is an optional extra that comes as part of the Technology Plus Pack, which also brings a dashcam and parking assistant. The M3 Touring nor regular 3 Series Touring have been crash tested by Euro NCAP , but the saloon version scored five-out-of-five with a huge 97% rating for adult occupants. Its 87% score for both child occupant protection and vulnerable road users is also impressive. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems There are no common reliability issues with the BMW M3, with most owners noting that recurring problems with the previous generation’s engine appear to have largely been addressed for the latest model. However, it’s worth noting that although it’s based on a popular, more affordable model, the M3 Touring is a performance car, so if anything goes wrong it will likely cost a good chunk more to replace than your average 3 Series. The M3 Touring comes with a three-year, unlimited mileage new car warranty that includes roadside assistance. For an extra £1,620 you can get BMW Service Inclusive, which covers your servicing for the first four years. This uses BMW technicians and genuine parts that are (mostly) covered for two years. BMW will also cover the cost of any MOT failures during the term of the agreement. The BMW 3 Series range, as a whole, finished in 18th position in the most recent Driver Power survey , but its rating for quality and reliability was only middling. BMW came 14th out of 32 brands, with 21.4% of owners reporting problems with their cars. BMW M3 Touring FAQs BMW M3 Touring FAQs"
https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/2-series-gran-coupe,BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe Review & Prices,"€49,208",7/10,new,"Is the BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe a good car? Is the BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe a good car? This is the BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe – a small family car that’s based on the 1 Series hatchback, but shares its name with the 2 Series Coupe . It gets swoopy coupe looks but four doors for added practicality. Confused yet? Like a teenager picking a baffling variety of GCSE subjects, the 2 Series Gran Coupe doesn’t know what it wants to be. Not that that means it’s the only small, four-door saloon -shaped family car out there. You might also consider the Audi A3 Saloon and Mercedes A-Class Saloon , for example. The BMW is arguably the least handsome of that trio, though. The styling has been updated with sharper headlights and a new-look grille, but it still has slightly awkward proportions, like a bigger car’s design has been draped over a small car and it doesn’t quite fit properly. Like a toddler wearing his dad’s suit. Inside there can be no such complaints. You get the twin-screen setup found in bigger, pricier BMWs, and it runs the latest operating software, so you get snappy responses and sharp displays. Temperature controls are now in the screen too, which is annoying, but it’s one of the easier-to-use examples of this setup. The driving position is excellent if you’re after a sporty feel. You sit low to the ground but visibility is still pretty good, and you’re surrounded by quality materials. A Mercedes A-Class Saloon’s cabin is a bit more visually stimulating, but the BMW is classier and feels much posher. Practicality is a bit less impressive. Space is okay in the front – it’s not exactly roomy, yet not claustrophobic as you might expect of a car of this size – but those in the back will find headroom limited, and bulky child seats will be a squeeze. Meanwhile, the boot is smaller than the A-Class Saloon and A3 Saloon. You have a choice of two petrol engines in the regular 2 Series Gran Coupe – the 220 has 170hp and front-wheel drive, while the 223 gets 218hp and all-wheel drive. There’s also the sportier M235, which bumps power up to 300hp. On the road the 2 Series Gran Coupe is easy to drive – while its small dimensions mean it’s not hugely practical, it does make it much less intimidating to drive than bigger family cars, and means you can enjoy narrow, twisty roads without worrying about whether you actually fit between the lines. The suspension is on the sporty side of comfortable, so you do feel bumps in the road but you don’t feel like you need a chiropractor on speed dial. Meanwhile, at motorway speeds it’s quiet and refined, so there’s no need to worry about taking this small car on a long trip. There’s a lot to like about the BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe – the thing is, if you’ve got a young family and want a BMW saloon, the 3 Series does everything better. If budget is an issue, you might want to consider a used BMW 3 Series instead. If this pint-sized saloon suits your needs, check out the latest BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe deals available through Carwow. You can also browse used 2 Series Gran Coupes , as well as other used BMWs from our network of trusted dealers. When it’s time to sell your current car , Carwow can help with that, too. How much is the BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe? How much is the BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe? Compared with the obvious alternatives – the Audi A3 Saloon and Mercedes A-Class Saloon – the BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe is a bit more expensive. The Audi starts around £30,000, the BMW around £35,000, and the Mercedes splits the difference. Although it’s the least practical, it does just about look and feel the poshest, which goes some way to justify the extra cash. That said, there are other roomier saloons available at this price if you’re not too worried about the badge on the bonnet – the Skoda Octavia , and even the bigger Superb , are both a similar price, and much better suited to family life. And if you’re looking at well-specced Gran Coupes, you’re knocking on the door of entry-level BMW 3 Series money. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort The BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe is refined on a motorway, but while it’s capable on a twisty road, it’s not huge fun The BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe is well-suited to city life because it feels so small from the driver’s seat, so you’re not too worried about width restrictors or nipping down car-lined streets. The down side is that you sit low, which feels nice and sporty, but you lack the commanding view you get from an SUV . Visibility is pretty good for a small saloon, though. We’ve only driven the performance-focused M235, but even in its comfiest setting the suspension is quite stiff. An Audi A3 Saloon is a bit more gentle over rough surfaces. Otherwise the engine and gearbox work well enough, with the latter rarely too flummoxed in everyday driving, meaning you always have power on tap to nip out at a busy roundabout. Hit motorway speeds and the BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe settles down nicely. You notice harsher bumps, but nothing so rough as to put you off, and impressive small car refinement means you can talk to your passenger without raising your voice. Wind and tyre noise are kept to a minimum. Adaptive cruise control is included as standard, but you can upgrade this for a cost to include automatic speed adjustment based on the speed limit, and a system that can nudge the steering to keep you centred in your lane. The ingredients are all there for the BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe to be great fun to drive down your favourite country road – and indeed it’s impressively capable. There’s loads of grip, little body roll and the suspension soaks up bumps nicely. Again, we’ve only tested the M235 so far, and the sporty drive modes and upgraded suspension help you navigate tight turns at pace, the well-judged steering making it easy to place the car on the road. And yet… perhaps it’s because it’s so tempting to hold BMW to higher standards because of the old Ultimate Driving Machine adage, perhaps it’s the engine, which is powerful but lacks character. It just doesn’t quite sparkle in the same way the Audi S3 Saloon does. That said, it’s likely that base model vs base model, the BMW will nick it – we’ll update this review once we’ve had a chance to compare. Space and practicality Space and practicality Space is decent up front, but the rear seats are tight and the boot is quite small Space up front is good enough. You’re aware you’re quite close to your passenger, and the dashboard rather surrounds you, but it’s in no way claustrophobic and even taller drivers will be able to get a comfortable driving position. The door bins are quite small, but there’s a useful cutout for a larger bottle. There are a couple of cup holders between the seats and a deep space beneath the armrest – not exceptional, but adequate practicality for a car of this size. Things are much tighter in the back seats. With a six-footer behind another six-footer, headroom and kneeroom is tight – fine for short journeys, but your passengers will want to rotate places on a road trip. Fitting three across the back is basically impossible – it’s a squeeze width-ways, plus the middle seat is raised and uncomfortable to sit in, with nowhere to put your knees. There’s limited storage, with small door bins – though again the cutout for a bottle is useful – and no pockets in the seatbacks in front. Finding the ISOFIX mounting points for a child seat is easy, but you might find it tricky to fit a bulky seat, plus the doors are small and the car is low to the ground, which makes it trickier to get the child in the seat than it is in an SUV that sits higher off the ground. Boot space isn’t fantastic – at 360 litres, you get less capacity than the Mercedes A-Class Saloon (395 litres) and the Audi A3 Saloon (425 litres). All three have the same issue, though, which is a small boot opening. If you regularly carry larger items this could be a problem, so consider a hatchback like the BMW 1 Series instead. Still, if you go for the 2 Series Gran Coupe, the bumper is low and you get a flat floor, which can be helpful when lifting heavy items in. The rear seats fold 40/20/40 too, so you can push long luggage through while carrying people in the back seats. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories Generally looks and feels quality with excellent technology, though some of the ambient lighting is tacky The BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe’s interior is its real highlight. It looks and feels much posher than the Mercedes A-Class Saloon’s cabin, and just about beats the Audi A3 Saloon too. Your eye is first caught by the twin-screen setup on top of the dashboard. On the left is the infotainment touchscreen, and ahead of the driver is the instrument display. Both are clear and easy to read, with sharp, modern graphics. The touchscreen is quick to respond to your inputs, with the only complaint being that BMW’s menus can be quite overwhelming and illogical to navigate. The dashboard design is clean and sophisticated, with little in the way of physical buttons. The climate controls have been moved to the screen, which isn’t as intuitive but is implemented better than most other manufacturers have, so it’s not too distracting. The only complaint here is the ambient lighting. Although the way it’s integrated into the trim is undoubtedly clever, it can look a bit tacky, particularly in red, white and blue to denote BMW’s M Division colour theme, as it was in our test car. Still, whether you like that or not is down to personal preference. What’s not is the fact that the 2 Series Gran Coupe largely impresses in terms of material quality. It’s possible to find cheap materials, but even these look posh, so you only shatter the illusion if you go poking and prodding about. MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax You have a choice of two petrol engines in the regular 2 Series Gran Coupe, as well as a more powerful version in the sportier M235 model. The range kicks off with the 220, which has 170hp and front-wheel drive. This should be the most economical, recording up to 53.3mpg in official tests. Step up to the 223 and you get 218hp and all-wheel drive, with reduced fuel economy of 47.9mpg. The go-faster M235 also has all-wheel drive, but power is bumped up to 300hp. Again though, this has a knock-on effect on fuel economy, which is recorded at up to 37.7mpg officially. A lack of full hybrid models means the 2 Series Gran Coupe isn’t a particularly good company car option, because all have a relatively high Benefit-in-Kind rating. First-year Vehicle Excise Duty costs are quite low for private buyers of the 220 and 223, but the M235 commands quite a high rate because of its high emissions. It also incurs the extra charge in years two to six because the starting price is over £40,000. Safety & security Safety & security The BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe has not yet been put through safety tests by the experts at Euro NCAP , and nor has the 1 Series with which it shares much of its makeup. You get plenty of assistance kit, including front collision and lane departure warning. Adaptive cruise control is standard-fit, as is a system that will park the car for you. Optional upgrades include more advanced cruise control tech that effectively steers the car for you. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems BMW scored a mid-table finish in the Driver Power owner satisfaction survey. Reliability isn’t fantastic and repair costs can be pricey, but owners love the build quality and driving experience. All BMWs come with a three-year, unlimited mileage warranty. If your car is nearing the end of this and it has been properly serviced in line with the manufacturer recommendations, you can buy an extended warranty.

https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/xm,BMW XM Review & Prices,"€166,889",6/10,new,"Is the BMW XM a good car? Is the BMW XM a good car? If you’re after a high-performance SUV , you’re currently spoilt for choice. Porsche, Lamborghini, and even Tesla have produced performance SUVs, but BMW’s M division was yet to have a proper go – until now. This is the BMW XM. Soon to be tussling with the Ferrari Purosangue , Lamborghini Urus Performante, Porsche Cayenne Turbo GT and Tesla Model X Plaid , the BMW XM is the first M Division -only car since the 70s (Yes there are other M-labelled SUVs – like the X5 M and X6 M – but the XM is an M-exclusive model) and it’s again jumping on current trends – this time it’s big, brash SUVs. It’s like deciding which bubble tea flavour to go for – all have different characteristics and suit different people. Where the XM certainly divides opinion is how it looks. It’s not a pretty car, to be blunt, with BMW doubling down on the huge kidney grilles, which now come with lights on the inside. You also get split headlights at the front, while you get a squarer design down the side. You can choose between 21-, 22- and 23-inch alloys – with the larger ones likely to fill the arches better – while the blocky design continues at the rear. You get thin taillights, quad tailpipes, a rear diffuser and BMW logos etched into the rear, all adding to the sporty nature. The cabin is much less controversial. It’s tidy, modern and features a sweeping screen holding both the driver’s display and infotainment touchscreen. You can get tasteful all-black or less tasteful two-tone upholstery to adorn the cabin alongside many other M features to make it even more obvious that it’s a special model – like the steering wheel-mounted M buttons and M-specific gear lever. With its square body shape and measuring 5.1m long, there’s loads of head and legroom, making it good for those wanting to carry passengers for the day-to-day family commute or for a fun countryside blast. The boot is 527 litres, which compared to its main rivals is about average. The Tesla Model X Plaid has over 1,100 litres with five seats in place, while the BMW also falls behind the Porsche Cayenne Turbo GT (549 litres) and Lamborghini Urus Performante (616 litres). It only beats the Ferrari Purosangue , which has a 473-litre boot. From launch, the plug-in hybrid XM will come with a 4.4-litre twin-turbocharged V8 paired with an electric motor developing 653hp and 800Nm of torque. The sprint from 0-60mph takes just 4.3 seconds and it can reach a limited top speed of 155mph. That limiter can be raised to 168mph. But if you want BMW’s most powerful road car ever in its punchiest form, you’ll want to wait for the Label Red version. It uses the same setup, but power is upped to 748hp and 1,000Nm of torque, promising even more impressive performance. The hybrid system for both includes a 25.7kWh battery pack that delivers up to 55 miles of electric-only driving. Charging on AC only, its max charging rate is 7.4kW and it takes a little under four and a half hours to fully charge. When you drive on electric, you do get less punch than you get with the petrol engine involved, but it makes town driving very easy. The steering is responsive and light enough, while the suspension soaks up most bumps and cracks in the road. There’s limited tyre noise from the huge wheels and the overall refinement is excellent, making long-distance driving a relaxing affair. Having the hybrid setup helps with fuel consumption, but it’ll be nowhere near BMW’s claimed figure of 188.3mpg because most won’t charge the electric system up often enough. To make sure it doesn’t feel too firm when you’re driving this 2,710kg SUV, BMW has fitted its adaptive M suspension setup so you can soften the ride for longer drives, and firm it up when you want to attack a road. However, you still feel a lot of lean on twistier roads even with this harder setup. There is plenty of performance offered by the 653hp power system, but when going for harder acceleration, the automatic transmission is hesitant to respond quickly enough, which takes away from the experience a little. You can fix this by using manual mode, but this issue makes it feel less like a flagship M car. While there are some admirable features that make the XM a cool car, it lacks some of the excitement of its rivals and doesn’t quite live up to the flagship M car billing as many would have hoped.

Compared to its alternatives, the XM starts off at a lower price. The Porsche Cayenne Turbo GT is on par, but the rest, like the Ferrari Purosangue, Lamborghini Urus Performante and Aston Martin DBX 707 are all much more expensive. If you want to go all-electric and not use the plug-in hybrid bridge that the XM offers, the Tesla Model X Plaid is much cheaper to buy and offers more than 330 miles of zero-emission range. This first version of the XM will be the entry option, while the Label Red will become the top-end choice when it arrives later in 2023. Performance and Drive Comfort Performance and Drive Comfort There’s plenty of punch from the electric motor and V8 engine, but it’s not as exciting as an M car should be Having the 197hpnelectric motor means you can cruise around town in your huge performance SUV silently and with decent enough performance. It’s punchy enough for getting away from the lights and out of junctions, and you can do up to 50 miles on a full charge. It’s also pretty comfortable over harsher bumps at slower speeds, with the standard adaptive dampers helping soak up any road imperfections. One issue though is the XM’s size. It’s quite a chunky car, measuring 5.1m long and just over 2m wide – longer but only slightly narrower than a Range Rover. Even with rear-wheel steering as standard, the turning circle is 12.5m, with large SUVs like the Range Rover doing much better. Out on the open road, the BMW XM starts to show some cracks. While in full hybrid mode, the automatic transmission can feel quite sluggish to change gear under hard acceleration. When you want to get up to speed, there’s a pause while the transmission, engine and electric system work out what to do. When it does deliver the power, it feels punchy and it gets up to speed quickly. The 4.4-litre V8 sounds excellent when accelerating but when you’re taking it easy, it settles down to be very refined. There’s loads of sound-deadening to help make the cabin a serene place to be, and on longer distances, the XM feels less like a performance SUV and more of a comfortable cruiser – something you might not expect from a sports flagship. One major drawback of the XM is that it’s rather bulky. Weighing upwards of 2,700kg, you feel that quite a lot when you’re cornering at higher speeds. Realistically, M cars should feel agile and fun to drive, and although there’s plenty of punch from the engine, it’s not the most invigorating SUV to drive. That being said, it corners flat and the brakes feel responsive. Other fast BMW SUVs do corner better and feel more interesting to drive though, like the X6 M. One thing to make sure you have fun while driving is putting the gearbox in manual mode and filling the power gaps yourself by changing down. Space and practicality Space and practicality There’s plenty of storage throughout and lots of passenger space, but the boot is a bit underwhelming Where the XM does very well is in the cabin. There’s lots of storage, with a large bin under the central armrest, a place for your phone under the dashboard with heated and cooled cup holders in front of it, and massive door bins that can hold a couple of bottles. For driving position, the XM also feels excellent. BMW always seems to do a good job and here you get an excellent view out of the front over the giant bonnet. There’s lots of adjustment on offer so you can make the most of the wonderful seats. Being such a long car, you get some excellent leg room, even behind the bulky sports seats. Headroom is also brilliant, even though the roofline does slope a little towards the rear. Also with the car being so wide, sitting three across the rear won’t be too tricky. As with the front, door pockets are of a good size and you get aeroplane-style openings on the seat backs for laptops or other devices. There are two USB-C charging ports in the middle and even one in the seat backs to give them juice as well. You also get uncovered cupholders in the fold down armrest. The space in the XM’s rear is about average for a performance SUV with 527 litres on offer. It’s more than the Ferrari Purosangue (473 litres), around the same as Porsche’s Cayenne Turbo GT (549 litres), but falls behind the Aston Martin DBX 707 (632 litres) and the Lamborghini Urus Performante (616 litres). Annoyingly for such a premium car, you don’t have switches in the boot to fold the seats down. You either have to lean in to reach the seat backs, or go round to the passenger doors to put the seats down. They don’t fold quite flat either, so loading things can be a little tricky. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories You get all the lovely M bits any M car should, like carbon fibre and sports seats, alongside stylish trim choices, but it doesn’t feel as special as the price might suggest The XM’s cabin tries to blend sportiness and luxury in one package and it’s mostly a success. You get the M steering wheel with carbon fibre paddle shifters alongside aluminium pedals, an M gear selector, carbon fibre trim on the dashboard and BMW M’s iconic tricolour dotted all the way around the cabin. You also get excellent sports seats trimmed in leather with XM in the headrest. You get swathes of leather on other surfaces as well, including on the armrests and door cards, while there’s further carbon fibre trim in the centre console. We mustn’t forget the huge curved display unit holding both the driver’s display and infotainment touchscreen, with the driver’s display getting M-specific graphics in case you forget you’re in an M car. But does this all add up to £150,000-worth of car? Not for us. It doesn’t quite feel special enough even if you have got a lot of premium features throughout as standard, like a high-end sound system and a roof headliner with ambient lighting. Back to the infotainment, and BMW’s iDrive 8 system is one of the smoothest around. It can be a little complex to use at times, and with some functions normally found on the steering wheel buried in menus on the touchscreen, it can be a little frustrating. Although the infotainment system is more refined than most, using your smartphone to mirror onto the extensive display is still the best option for most, with both Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connecting wirelessly. You can add kit from the extensive options list, including the M Driver’s Pack that ups the top speed to 168mph, improved speakers and additional driver assists. MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax With a stonking V8 engine under the bonnet, you might expect poor fuel economy from a car weighing 2,700kg. But with the electric motor assisting, BMW says the XM can return up to 188.3mpg. If you have a place to charge up the battery pack regularly you may see that figure, but for the most part, you’ll be seeing much lower numbers – especially if you take full advantage of the V8. Having the electrical assistance also helps with emissions. BMW says the XM produces 33-36g/km CO2, which puts it in one of the lowest tax brackets in the UK. But with the car costing more than £40,000 – a lot more in this instance – you’ll be adding an additional cost on top of that in the first five years of ownership. Safety and security Safety and security The XM is yet to have gone through the rigorous Euro NCAP test cycle, so there’s no star rating yet. As standard, the XM gets front collision warning, lane departure warning with lane return assistance, evasion assist, alertness assistance and speed limit assist. You can add an additional driving assistance pack, which adds adaptive cruise control, steering and lane control assistance, emergency lane change and stop warning, and route monitoring to name a few things – although you would expect a car costing upwards of £148,000 to have adaptive cruise as standard. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems As an all-new model, there’s no news on reliability for the XM specifically. BMW has a decent reputation in this sense, so you can expect that to carry over to the XM. With each new BMW, you get three years of unlimited mileage warranty that also includes BMW roadside assistance. For PHEVs from the brand, like the XM, the battery pack installed is covered for six years or 60,000 miles – whichever comes first."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/x7-m60i,BMW X7 M60i Review & Prices,"€145,068",8/10,new,"Is the BMW X7 M60i a good car? Is the BMW X7 M60i a good car? The BMW X7 M60i is the performance version of the German brand’s seven-seat SUV and comes with refreshed styling like the updated X7 . With a huge M-division V8, it goes up against the likes of the Range Rover SVR, Porsche Cayenne Turbo and Mercedes-AMG G63 . There are plenty of performance SUVs now, but this particular one is practical for families and smart – much like getting a large North Face duffle bag. Looks-wise, the M60i takes the rather bold updated styling of the base X7, then adds some sportiness. Add deeper bumpers, larger inlets and 23-inch alloy wheels, as well as a smattering of M logos, and you’ve got a dynamic-looking SUV. The dynamic feeling continues into the cabin, with carbon fibre, aluminium and leather adorning most of the surfaces. You also get nice ambient lighting throughout, while you can also get the panoramic sunroof with lighting across that as well. You get lots of storage, with big door pockets, a large bin under the armrest and a decent glovebox – although air fresheners do take up some space. As a seven-seater, the adjustable middle row has a good amount of space, whether you have the seats in their forwardmost or rearmost position. There’s a good amount of headroom too, even with a panoramic sunroof. Even in the rearmost seats, you get some decent space. Although headroom isn’t the best, adults can be comfortable, as you also get room for your feet under the seats in front, while there’s also a cupholder and USB chargers, as you do in the middle row. With all seven seats in place, you get 326 litres of luggage space, with a split-folding tailgate offering a handy perch. Folding the rear seats gives you 750 litres behind the middle row. All the seats can be folded down with switches in the rear, and when the middle row is put down, you get a mostly flat space. The seven-seat Range Rover has 818 litres with the rear seats folded down, while the Mercedes GLS has 890 litres. BMW has tweaked the chassis of the X7 with this M60i, and when you take it on a twisty road, you get flat-cornering and an impressive overall driving experience. The suspension is especially impressive, providing lots of balance and the ability to soak bumps up brilliantly. The 4.4-litre twin-turbocharged V8 is also a triumph, giving lots of performance when you need it, while the eight-speed transmission is responsive in sport mode. As you would expect from an expensive SUV with adaptive suspension, you get a comfortable ride around town, and even though the M60i gets rear-wheel steering, the turning circle is 12.4m – larger than a Range Rover’s 11m. It’s not the smallest car either, but the large windows help with visibility. On the motorway, the M60i has plenty of kit to make long-distance journeys smooth, such as adaptive cruise control and lane keep assist. In comfort mode especially, the X7 is an excellent cruiser. It may not be an obvious performance SUV choice, but the X7 M60i is comfortable, has loads of power and plenty of space – even if other options have a bit more space. If you want to get the best deals on the X7 M60i or other new BMW models , you should check out carwow, where you can also get great prices on used BMW models . You can sell your car through carwow as well, with our trusted dealers bidding on your car so you can get the best price. How much is the BMW X7 M60i? How much is the BMW X7 M60i? Compared to other performance SUVs, the M60i is surprisingly good value. It’s cheaper to buy than the comparative Porsche Cayenne, Range Rover SVR and Mercedes-AMG G63 by some way. But compared to the rest of the X7 line-up, it’s considerably more expensive – close to £30,000 more than the base X7 . Performance and Drive Comfort Performance and Drive Comfort Comfortable, composed and nice to drive, the X7 M60i is a capable performance SUV, but it’s quite large and has a big turning circle Measuring almost 5.2m long, the M60i is quite long, and it’s roughly as wide as a Range Rover. It has rear-wheel steering like the Range Rover, but it has a turning circle 1m bigger at 12.3m, so it’s not as manoeuvrable. But for such a big car, the X7 M60i still does okay moving around, especially considering the base X7, without the rear-wheel steering has a 13m turning circle. The wing mirrors are conversely a little small, limiting the view around the car in tighter situations. But the rest of the windows allow for decent visibility, taking advantage of the high seating position that you have – although not as high as the Range Rover. In comfort mode, the adaptive suspension soaks bumps up impressively well for a sporty model – even the 23-inch alloy wheels can spoil it. For long-distance cruising, the X7 M60i’s twin-turbocharged V8 engine isn’t very efficient to tell the truth. On a sensible cruise, the X7 can return an official 23.2mpg. Considering it’s a performance car, it’s not too bad – but as a practical SUV it’s not ideal to say the least. Putting that to one side though, and the X7 is comfortable and well-insulated so you won’t be too bothered by exterior noise and cracks in the road. The transmission can be a little hesitant in kicking down, so there’ll be a slight pause before you start accelerating. When you do start though, it doesn’t take long to get to the speed you want. BMW has added a fair amount of upgrades to make the M60i as dynamic as it is comfortable. It gets active roll stabilisation, swivel motors to increase control through corners and reduce vibrations, an M Sport differential, retuned electronic steering, M Sport brakes and the aforementioned rear wheel steering that also helps at higher speeds. While being quite bulky at 2,675kg, the X7 feels surprisingly agile in this spec, to the point of being described as fun. The V8 kicks you out of corners in sport mode impressively and makes rapid progress, even on twistier roads. You do have to remember that the X7 is 2m wide, and on narrower carriageways you’ll need to be careful on oncoming vehicles at times, but for such a large car it’s impressive. It handles excellently with its tweaked steering, and rides well with its adaptive suspension. Space and practicality Space and practicality You get a large amount of storage and space throughout, but alternatives do offer more boot space As a large SUV, you can expect loads of interior storage spots and plenty of room for yourself. Either side of the driver’s seat, you get a large doorbin – which is surprisingly unlined – and a central bin under the armrest. The doorbin is mirrored on the other door and there’s a well-sized glovebox. Fragrances for the air conditioning system does take up space though. Both seats have great levels of adjustment, with the electronic controls helping get you comfy. The driver’s seat also gets electronic steering wheel adjustment, and by setting on the memory function, multiple drivers can get their ideal position quickly. With two rows in the back as standard, you get five extra seats – and optionally you can take one of the middle row out to get two captain’s chairs instead of a bench. But with the bench in place, you have plenty of head and legroom. The middle row can slide 14.5cm depending on where you most need extra space, and even in its most forward position, you still have ample legroom for the middle row to allow those in the rearmost seats to get as comfy as possible. You can easily sit three adults across the back, and for those needing to carry children, you have two sets of ISOFIX points . In row three, you get ISOFIX points too for extra child-friendliness, while adults can just about squeeze in there too. Both rows get pockets or storage, multiple USB-C charging points and cupholders, Against alternatives, the X7 does struggle to keep pace for luggage space. The 326 litres with all the seats in place is better than the Range Rover (212 litres) and Audi Q7 (295 litres), but the Mercedes GLS has 355 litres available. But beyond that, all the alternatives perform better. The X7’s 750 litres with the rear seats folded down is less than all the aforementioned options. The Range Rover has 857 litres, the Audi Q7 865 litres and the Mercedes GLS has 890 litres on offer. All of the middle and rear seats can be folded down with the flick of a switch, and with the split tailgate, you have a handy place to sit or to slide long items in. You can also lower the suspension to make loading things easier, thanks to the adaptive suspension system. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories As with other BMWs, the cabin is well-built and pretty stylish, but some features are annoyingly buried in the touchscreen With the M60i version of the X7, you get black wood across most of the surfaces as standard, but you can choose carbon fibre to add to the sporty nature. That’s paired with aluminium trim pieces, with the small gear lever and drive options all housed in the centre console. But being the M version, you get tricolours smattered around the cabin. It’s on the seatbelts and the digital dials, while there’s further M logos on the steering wheel and in the ambient lighting. The overall quality of the cabin is excellent, with the standard-fit leatherette used to upholster the seats, but you can choose merino leather for a more premium finish. There are some scratchy plastics around the doorbins, which feels uncharacteristic compared to the rest of the car, but that’s the only place of note. You get a huge panel across the dashboard holding both the driver’s display and infotainment touchscreen, running the latest iDrive 8 system. The graphics are mostly clear, but it can be a little tricky to navigate when you’re on the move. A drawback of the setup is that BMW has oversimplified everything. All of the major settings for the cruise control and the entire climate system are all in the touchscreen, and when you’re driving, that’s a big distraction. You get wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto , both very simple to connect and also capable of showing the map application in the instrument screen – a very handy feature. On the whole, both are a better alternative to the BMW setup. As the M60i, there are very few things you can add to it to make it better, but there are some additional features including a towbar, additional ambient lighting, proper sports seats and improved headlights. MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax With a 4.4-litre twin-turbocharged V8, you can never expect it to be efficient. At best, it’ll return 23.2mpg, which for a seven-seat, potentially family SUV, is far from ideal. Emissions-wise, there’s not other way of putting it – the M60i is high on the scale. It goes from 276-292g/km CO2 that puts it in one of the highest tax brackets, and as the car is worth more than £40,000, there’s an additional charge for the first five years of ownership. Safety and security Safety and security Unlike the majority of BMW’s models, the X7 hasn’t been through the rigorous Euro NCAP safety testing cycle. But as standard, the M60i comes with adaptive cruise control with brake assist, parking sensors and cameras for all-round views. Strangely though, there’s some safety systems that you need to add in a pack for total security. The Technology Plus Pack includes traffic assist, lane keep assist and predictive speed limit adaption, and that’s an extra £5,000 – which is a bit of a rip-off for a car already costing £116,000. As mentioned in the interior section, you get ISOFIX points throughout, as well as multiple airbags. The exterior also has M Sport brakes, which further improve the safety of the vehicle in all conditions. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems With lots of electronic elements, the X7 may falter further down the road, and BMW’s reliability rating has not been quite as high for a little while as some might expect. But compared to a Range Rover, which has a poor reputation, it should be better overall. The X7, as with all new BMWs, gets a three-year/unlimited mileage warranty, while there’s a 12-year guarantee for anti-corrosion. For that to be maintained, you need to go through an approved BMW workshop."

If you’re after a sporty-looking car that offers some extra practicality, the BMW 4 Series Gran Coupe is worth checking out. If you were in the market for something practical and sporty, your options used to be limited to a shooting brake-style estate, like a Volkswagen Arteon , a super expensive sport saloon ( BMW M5 anyone?) or the Audi A5 Sportback . But this updated version of the BMW could be for you. Much like the A5 Sportback is just an extended version of the regular A5 , the Gran Coupe takes the sleek, coupe styling of the standard 4 Series and adds two extra doors at the rear and a hatchback boot lid. Viewed side-on it looks properly smart, it’s just a shame its massive twin kidney grilles make it look a bit like an angry beaver up front. Compared to the previous 4 Series Gran Coupe, this version is taller, longer and wider, which helps to improve interior space. The cabin is as well-built and generously kitted out as any BMW, with soft-touch materials fitted alongside a high level of standard equipment. Inside, your eyes are drawn to the 12.0-inch digital instrument display with BMW’s latest hexagonal-like dial graphics, but it’s a pity that you might find the screen a bit hard to read. You also get a crisp 10.3-inch infotainment touchscreen that can be used with the familiar iDrive control dial in the centre console, and this works very well indeed. You’ll have no trouble getting comfortable in the 4 Series Gran Coupe, as you can get optional electric seat controls with lumbar and bolster adjustment. The sport seats that you can have fitted are a little firm on a longer drive, but they keep you very well supported. Particularly lofty adults might have a harder time getting settled in the back seats, though, thanks to the car’s dramatically sloping roofline and limited headroom. That swooping silhouette comes at a price, it seems. The boot is a good size, but it’s still smaller than in the 3 Series saloon. You have the choice of three petrol engines and one diesel, all of which are paired to an eight-speed automatic gearbox. Seeing as this is a sporty-looking model, the six-cylinder M440i may be tempting as it’s very fast and refined. Saying that, the sole 420d diesel option will be the most efficient. As there are only three trims to choose from, pairing the M Sport Pro with the 420d xDrive all-wheel drive unit combines the best in efficiency and year-round practicality. With its accurate steering, it feels pretty entertaining through the corners, and although some bumps are felt at slower speeds due to the firm M Sport suspension that’s fitted as standard, it’s not unliveable with by any means. On longer drives, it settles down superbly and cruising is an absolute breeze – especially with the optional adaptive cruise control system with steering assist to help keep you in the right lane. It can feel quite large on narrower roads and between tight gaps in town, but its steering is set up so it’s nice and light at low speed – making it easier to manoeuvre. Although there are places where the 4 Series Gran Coupe may be very appealing, you can’t help but think that it isn’t quite as practical as the 3 Series , nor as sleek as the regular 4 Series Coupe. Even though it treads the line between the two well, you may feel that you’re better off with one or the other – and not a blend of the two. It’s also not the cheapest. When you tick boxes for the multiple option packs – which you probably will – prices start to get a bit silly. A lot of desirable kit – such as the top driving assistance kit and a wireless charge pad – is only available this way too, which is a bit of a pain. But if the BMW 4 Series Gran Coupe sounds like it could be the car for you, then head to our deals page to see how much you could save through carwow, or click through to our used BMW page for the latest deals on nearly new cars. How much is the BMW 4 Series Gran Coupe Sportback? How much is the BMW 4 Series Gran Coupe Sportback? SE is the entry level and is generally well equipped with lots of standard kit and leather trim. It can be specified with petrol or diesel, the latter of which are supported by a mild-hybrid system. Next up is the M Sport. It gets sports seats, lowered sports suspension to reduce how much the car leans in corners, blue interior trims on the doors and dashboard, a wider sat nav screen than the SE model and a soft leather gear knob for manual cars. Like all M Sport BMWs, it also gets a more aggressive look thanks to sporty front and rear bumpers, and a black front grille. The Pro Edition packs adds to M Sport spec with extra goodies including M adaptive suspension; M Sport differential and brakes with red calipers; 19-inch wheels, extended Shadowline exterior trim, black door mirrors, Free Form exhaust finishers, M Sport seatbelts, Aluminium Fabric interior trim and sun-protection glass. At the very top is the M440i, which comes with all the same features as the M Sport model, but the bits that make it handle and stop are upgraded. There's adaptive suspension, M Sport brakes with red calipers, variable sport steering and an M Sport differential. All the better for coping with the extra power. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort Sportier than a 3 Series, the Gran Coupe works best in the performance-focused trim levels, but expect some degree of tyre and wind noise at motorway speeds The 4 Series Gran Coupe feels really well-balanced in most conditions and it offers more feel from its electronic steering setup than most alternatives. Having driven both the M440i and 420d, there are some similarities across the range. Even though the M440i’s character is sharper, all Gran Coupe models have M Sport steering as standard, so they all feel very direct and have well-weighted controls. You will feel it becoming lighter at slower speeds and that helps when navigating around town. The Gran Coupe can feel a bit wide through narrower streets and in traffic, but with good visibility and the optional fleet of all-round cameras available, you shouldn’t have much trouble. Where this car is at its best is on the motorway. With the sleek coupe design and excellent sound deadening, the cabin is super refined. And when you’ve got your music playing, you won’t notice the minor tyre and wind noise so much at all. Add to that the option of the assisted driving system as part of the £3,650 Technology Plus Pack, and this car will take you from one end of the country to the other without much hassle at all. BMW fits lowered, firmer M Sport suspension to the 4 Series Gran Coupe as standard regardless of trim level. That may sound like it’ll make the Gran Coupe uncomfortable, but it really doesn’t. The only time you’ll notice bumps really making an impact is at slower speeds, as elsewhere the 4 Series feels very composed and sure-footed. When you want to open the taps a bit and enjoy a back road, the 4 Series feels very comfortable here too. It doesn’t lean too much round the corners, and the adaptive suspension that comes as standard in the M440i does an excellent job of keeping it stable. Add in the M Sport differential and xDrive system, and it’s properly quick in most conditions. Space and practicality Space and practicality The boot is pretty impressive and the cabin ergonomically great, but rear seat passengers are compromised The 4 Series Gran Coupe is essentially a 3 Series up-front but that’s no bad thing as the 3 is a comfortable, refined and well laid-out car. With the optional electric adjustable seats, the front passenger can stretch out a lot and has decent headroom. There’s a good amount of bolstering at the sides to keep you snug, while you can adjust the lumbar support to help keep a stiff back at bay. There’s a good amount of storage throughout. In the front, you have two cupholders and the door bins are reasonably sized. Just make sure you don’t accidentally knock the boot-release button in the driver’s side door bin, though. In the back, the storage isn’t the best. You do get covered cup holders in the central armrest and decent door bins. But if you choose the optional sport seats in the front, they get hard backs and no pockets for things like phones and tablets. With the sloping roofline however, rear headroom is a bit compromised. It’s better than the regular 4 Series, which isn’t as long and has a steeper roofline, but next to the 3 Series saloon, you’ll find this car feels much more cramped in the back. The rear bench is set quite low too, and that means your knees are a little higher. With the front sport seats fitted, you won’t be able to stretch out by sliding your feet beneath them, either, all of which makes the back seats a bit less comfy than you might like. Another advantage over the standard 4 Series is that you get a middle seat in the Gran Coupe. That being said, the high transmission tunnel and low roofline mean it’s only really suitable for particularly short passengers. You also get twin ISOFIX fixture points with covers, making them easy to access. The 470-litre boot space is pretty decent for a car of this size and shape – after all, coupes aren’t normally known for their practicality. It’s bigger than an Audi A5 Sportback – this gets 465 litres. Add the £1,950 Comfort Plus pack and that load space becomes even more versatile, as it adds extra storage areas to the boot. It’s worth pointing out that the 3 Series saloon’s boot has 10 litres more storage capacity than that of the Gran Coupe, however. Folding the rear seats down increases the load capacity to 1,290 litres, which can help out a lot when you need it. That said, there’s no way to fold the seats down from inside the boot, and there’s no place to store the load cover when removed. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories Everything is to hand, well laid-out and high-quality, but it’s not the most characterful of cabins As with most BMWs, the cockpit of the 4 Series Gran Coupe isn’t that exciting to look at. But what they always do is deliver on quality, fit and driver involvement. You always feel like everything important is angled towards you, while the style lines are very well thought-out and make for a very pleasing experience. The touchscreen, though, looks like an afterthought. It flows well into the rest of the centre console at the bottom, but it sticks up a bit at the top, and BMW could have made it look a bit smoother like they did in the all-electric i4. There are five leather colour options to choose from, with the two black options looking the smartest. There’s also a handful of dashboard trim options to help you further personalise your Gran Coupe, all of which are of a good quality. Even though this 4 Series Gran Coupe is a new model, it gets an older version of BMW’s iDrive infotainment system. But that’s no bad thing. This version is pretty simple to navigate, and with a customisable setup you’re able to put the menus you want on the main page. You can also use the ‘Hey, BMW’ voice command system to set the sat nav and tune into your favourite radio station. It’s a good system, but you might find you prefer to just use Apple CarPlay or Android Auto . The former can be hooked up wirelessly, while you’ll need a good old-fashioned cable for the latter. Both systems come as standard. With the optional Technology Plus Pack fitted, you get a head-up display too. You can alter the brightness and positioning, so it should be pretty easy to read during the day. It shows your directions for your sat-nav as well as your current speed. MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax Under the bonnet, you have the choice of three petrol engines and a sole diesel unit. The entry 420i and more powerful 430i are both based on a turbocharged 2.0-litre four-cylinder petrol, developing 184hp and 245hp respectively. You can also go for the diesel 420d, a four-cylinder 2.0-litre engine that develops 190hp. It’s the only one of these three to be available with xDrive all-wheel drive – which you might find handy in those colder winter months. All the engines available are capable of accelerating from 0-60mph in less than eight seconds, with the slowest model – the 420i – still able to do that sprint in 7.9 seconds. But if those engines sound a bit unexciting, then the six-cylinder M440i might float your boat – as it’s the closest this car comes to a hot-blooded M version. Under the bonnet of that model is a turbocharged, straight-six 3.0-litre petrol engine that develops 374hp and 500Nm. That means 0-60mph in 4.7 seconds and a limited top speed of 155mph. Both the diesel and M440i options get a 48-volt mild-hybrid setup to improve fuel economy and run parts of the electrical system when the engine is switched off when you’re sat still. With the 420d, you can expect upwards of 50mpg and plenty of miles between trips to the pump. Even though it’s the most characterful and exciting engine option, sadly the M440i doesn’t get much more than 33mpg on a commute, or at best 40mpg on a longer motorway run. Even though there are some vibrations through the pedal and some noise comes into the cabin under hard acceleration, the 420d is arguably the engine that suits this car the best. It can easily cover huge distances on a single tank, is punchy enough for overtakes on the motorway, and is more than smooth enough. Get the xDrive all-wheel-drive system, and you’ll find it suits almost all weather conditions perfectly. Safety and security Safety and security The 4 Series Gran Coupe comes with standard advanced driving assistance systems under its Active Driving Assistant suite of safety features. These include lane-departure warning, speed limit assist, active blind-spot warning, rear cross-traffic alert, and rear-collision avoidance. It has a five-star Euro NCAP safety rating. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems BMW offers a three-year, unlimited-mile warranty on the 4 Series Gran Coupe including breakdown cover and recovery. The anti-corrosion body warranty is 12 years. There have been no UK recalls so far."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/ix2,BMW iX2 Review & Prices,"€63,584",7/10,new,"Is the BMW iX2 a good car? Is the BMW iX2 a good car? BMW has really made a mark in the electric car market, and the iX2 is the latest addition to its EV stable. As with the petrol-powered X2 , it’s based on the same mechanical package as the iX1 electric SUV, but gets sharper exterior styling that comes a little at the expense of practicality. It’s a bit like sports fleece jackets — the iX1 is a roomy and comfy fleece, designed for practicality, while the iX2 is more sporty and form-fitting, with a tailored look to it. The iX2 is entering a pretty crowded marketplace when it comes to stylish electric SUVs and crossovers — there’s already the choice of the Audi Q4 e-tron Sportback , the Volvo EC40 , and of course the big-selling Tesla Model Y . On the outside, the iX2 looks very much the same as the petrol X2 — if you’re trying to tell them apart, really aside from the badges the only way to do so is to look at the grille, which is blanked-off for the iX2. If you fancy an electric car but maybe don’t fancy making too big a visual statement about it, that could be a good thing for you. Range: 266-282 miles Efficiency: 3.6-3.8 miles per kWh Battery size: 64.8kWh Max charge speed: 130kW Charge time AC: 10hrs 0mins, 0-100%, 7kW Charge time DC: 29mins, 10-80%, 130kW Charge port location: Right rear Power outputs: 204hp / 313hp That sharply-sloping rear roofline certainly marks the iX2 out as being one of the more stylish and dramatic-looking electric SUVs you can buy — it’s definitely more interesting to look at than the slightly blobby Audi or Tesla — but it won’t be to everyone’s taste. Inside, the cabin looks and feels very modern and high-tech, but some of the materials used are too cheap when you’re shopping at the more expensive end of the iX2’s price list. The big, wide, curved-screen layout for the infotainment screen and the driver’s instruments looks great though, and it’s hugely responsive. The layout is fairly easy to find your way around, too, and the on-screen icons are large and easy to press, but there are a few too many complicated sub-menus for some functions. Practicality takes a hit compared to the iX1, as despite the boot being large on paper compared to most alternatives the sloping roof limits the size of loads that you can take. And while the rear seats are really roomy for two adults, the centre seat is almost useless - making the iX2 a four-seater except for very occasional use. BMW sells two versions of the iX2. Although they use the same size of battery, the more powerful all-wheel drive version doesn’t go as far on a charge as the less powerful two-wheel drive version, which can go 282 miles. The iX2 is as quiet and refined as you’d hope from an electric car, but while it does drive well, and can corner hard, there’s maybe not the gap between it and rivals from Volvo and Audi that there used to be. The steering is satisfying, although a little odd at times, and performance is ample. Like the iX1 it’s up there as one of the benchmarks in the sector. If you’re interested, check out the latest BMW iX2 deals on Carwow. You can also check out used BMW iX2s for sale , or other used BMWs here . And remember that when the time comes for car-changing you can even sell your car online through Carwow’s network of trusted dealers. How much is the BMW iX2? How much is the BMW iX2? The iX2 starts at more than £50,000 for the eDrive20 model in its sole M Sport trim, which is quite a sum considering the same powertrain costs around £5,000 less in the iX1. However, that’s in a lower trim level - the equivalent iX1 M Sport is only around £600 below the iX2. That said, it’s very easy to spec your iX2 up to well over £60,000, especially if you go for the all-wheel drive iX2 30e model, and add the desirable M-Sport pack. In comparison with the likes of the Volvo EC40 or Tesla Model Y, the iX2 is quite pricey and actually ends up competing with larger, longer-range EVs such as the Kia EV6 and Audi Q4 e-tron Sportback. Good residual values make for appealing finance packages, but in cash terms, the iX2 is quite an expensive car - especially if you want the additional performance of the xDrive30 model. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort Powerful and good to drive, but visibility is terrible and the steering is a little strange The iX2’s electric powertrain (and slew of useful driver aids) make it a doddle to pilot around town. Even in its most efficient setting, there’s plenty of punch to get away quickly at traffic lights - with the benefit of the gearless, seamless electric motor making for smooth progress no matter what. Visibility out of the front is good, but the rear of the car has very poor visibility with a small rear window and thick C-pillar limiting your over-the-shoulder view. At least there’s plenty of technology to help you out - particularly BMW’s clever parking systems, which can park the car for you or even repeat your last moves in reverse if you’ve gone too far down a narrow cul-de-sac or have to back out of a tight spot in a multi-storey car park. The other blot on the iX2’s copybook is the suspension. The regular X2 is quite firm in terms of how it smooths out imperfections in the road surface, but the additional weight of the iX2’s battery pack makes things a little worse still. It’s far from unbearable, but you really do notice the bumps in the road. A Volvo EC40 or Audi Q4 e-tron are both much more accomplished at ironing out poor surfaces or speed bumps. The iX1 suffers from the same issue, but it can be improved by opting for a different specification with smaller alloy wheels - not possible in the single-trim iX2 range. The iX2’s firm suspension is much less noticeable at speed on a smooth motorway. The car settles down quite nicely and makes for a good cruiser. There is some road noise, but mostly it’s all pretty well suppressed. There’s plenty of punch from the xDrive30 model we tested, even in the 50-70mph range where some electric cars can feel sluggish. Of course, with 313hp on tap, you’d rather hope that this model was powerful enough for motorway speeds to feel effortless. We’ll update this review with our impressions of the lower-powered eDrive20 when we’ve tested it, but it still has 204hp and shouldn’t feel underpowered. The iX2’s silent electric powertrain plus its aerodynamic silhouette means that it’s a very refined car on the motorway, while standard-fit cruise control takes the sting out of long trips. You can also add one of BMW’s driver assistance packages, which bring goodies like adaptive cruise control and a head-up display, though it’s a shame these don’t come as standard given the iX2’s price. The iX2 is pretty good when you reach an exciting road - the steering is nicely weighted and accurate, so it’s easy to place the car where you’re aiming it, but it does feel a little slow to react at first, before suddenly throwing the nose at a corner. The xDrive30 model has all the power you could want on a British B-road, and if you overcook it slightly you can feel the rear motor stepping in to stop you from getting too out of line. It’ll do 0-62mph in a brisk 5.6 seconds, compared to 8.6 seconds for the eDrive20. It’s never really ‘fun’, though - a bit like the iX1, you can really feel that the iX2 is quite a heavy car when you start to get a move on. It doesn’t feel especially nimble, like smaller BMWs typically do. The many drive modes have some strange names, but ‘Sport’ is as you’d expect - it sharpens up the throttle response and weights up the steering some more, but doesn’t fundamentally change the car’s character. A Kia EV6 is more satisfying to drive on a good road. Space and practicality Space and practicality A good boot and reasonable space for two in the back, just don’t try and fit a third rear passenger Drivers and front passengers of all sizes shouldn’t have much to complain about in the BMW iX2. Unlike some EVs where you sit uncomfortably high, the iX2’s front seats go down nice and low, and there’s loads of adjustment. Especially of note for taller drivers is the extendable seat cushion, which gives drivers with long legs a bit more under-thigh support. Storage space is good but not exceptional - there are ample door bins and a good-sized glovebox, but there’s a lack of anywhere useful to sling keys, wallets or other assorted pocket debris. The tray underneath the central armrest isn’t very easily accessible when you’re sat down either, and the side-hinged lid for the storage area under the armrest hasn’t been swapped over for right-hand drive, so it’s almost useless for the driver. What’s very good is the wireless smartphone charger, though, which has a spring-loaded retaining bar to keep your smartphone safe and secure, but why is it optional when you’re spending this much money? If you’re not making use of the wireless connections there are a pair of USB-C sockets, too. There’s a surprising amount of space for rear passengers considering the iX2’s stylish silhouette. A six-foot tall adult can easily sit behind a driver of a similar height, with plenty of legroom and just about enough headroom. Anyone taller will find their hair brushing the roofline, but that’s easily remedied by slouching a little. That said, the fact that the battery is under the floor does take away space for your feet. Rear passengers are treated to a pair of USB-C sockets in the centre, and useful door bins that can take a bottle of water with ease. It’s also good that those shallow rear windows wind all the way down. The centre passenger has a rather worse time, though. Not only is the middle seat narrower and harder than the outer two, but there’s a hump in the roof lining that really restricts headroom for anyone sitting there, and makes the people in the outer seats lean outward, which means that they’ll be brushing their heads off the roof. If you need to seat three rear passengers, then you’d be much better off with a BMW iX1 or Tesla Model Y. Loading child seats isn’t the easiest thing, as the rear doors are smaller than on the iX1 and the lower roofline restricts the opening space. ISOFIX points are present and correct in both outer rear seats, behind removable plastic covers. The iX2’s 525-litre boot is a really good size and shape. On paper, it’s even bigger than the iX1 - but that’s just the space below the parcel shelf. In reality, the iX1’s squarer tailgate means you can accommodate taller items and more overall than the more sloping iX2. Still, it’s a very useful space - the Audi Q4 e-tron Sportback is almost identical with 520 litres, but a Tesla Model Y eclipses it with more than 800 litres of space. The iX2 doesn’t have a front boot like some other electric cars, but there is a cubby under the boot floor that’s ideal for storing cables. The seats fold in a 40:20:40 split, which is useful when you have long, thin items and still want to carry two rear passengers. However, there’s no way of stowing the massive luggage cover, other than by laying it flat on the floor of the boot, which is not the best. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories High-quality with a great touchscreen system, but lack of buttons can frustrate The iX2’s interior is almost identical to the regular X2, itself lifted straight from the X1/iX1 and similar to other small BMWs. That’s not a bad thing in the least - it doesn’t feel at all like an entry-level car, with very high interior quality throughout and plenty of luxurious materials. Even lower on the dash where plastics are a little cheaper, it still feels well-built. Unlike a Mercedes EQA, there are almost no creaks and rattles but some of the cheaper materials — the sun visors especially — start to feel way too cheap once you’re shopping at the higher end of the price list. The dashboard is dominated by two large screens - a centre infotainment screen that measures 10.25 inches, and a driver display for instrumentation that measures 10.7 inches. Both sit under the same piece of glass, making for a seamless look and feel. The screens are both bright and clear, with a responsive interface. Everything’s easy enough to hit, which is good as unlike larger BMWs there is no rotary dial to use as a backup. However, there are so many features that sometimes you do end up having to scroll through a lot of menus - not always easy to do on the move. However, BMW has retained physical controls for things like the seats and the mirrors, which is good, but less good is the fact that electric seat adjustment is optional, even on the pricier versions. An optional Technology Pack provides an auto-dimming rear-view mirror, adaptive LED lights, the aforementioned wireless charging pad and keyless entry. For a bit extra you can get the Technology Plus pack, which has a very useful head-up display, BMW’s augmented-reality navigation system, and the ‘Iconic Glow’ illuminated grille. A Harman Kardon audio system is also available as an option, and sounds fantastic. Electric range, charging and tax Electric range, charging and tax The iX2 isn’t up there with the best EVs for range, but nor does it embarrass itself. With a maximum range of 282 miles from the eDrive20, it does look a little weedy next to cars like the Tesla Model Y, Volvo C40 or Kia EV6 - all of which can do more than 300 miles per charge, officially. The more powerful xDrive30 has a maximum range of 266 miles, although it’s more likely to give you around 220 miles in real-world conditions. However, the BMW does have a smaller battery than those cars, so it’s actually quite efficient - this will pay dividends when it comes to the overall cost of ownership, especially if you regularly use public charging. Speaking of public charging, find a sufficiently powerful charge station and the iX2 can top up at a maximum rate of 130kW. That’s good for a 10-80% charge in 29 minutes in a best-case scenario. Again, that’s not hugely impressive next to Volvo and Tesla’s 200kW-plus speeds, but it’s sufficient for the size of the iX2’s battery. As an EV, the iX2 is the cheapest model in the X2 range when it comes to company car tax , with really competitive benefit-in-kind rates making it cost-effective to run. As with all pure EVs, it’s also exempt from vehicle excise duty as well as London’s congestion charge until 2025. Safety and security Safety and security The iX2 hasn’t been individually tested by Euro NCAP but it’s likely it will inherit its rating from the mechanically similar iX1. That scored a full five stars when Euro NCAP tested it. Safety equipment for the X2 is good, with the latest version of its autonomous emergency braking system even able to warn the driver of pedestrians or cyclists travelling parallel to the car that might be in the way when turning. The same system can warn you if you’re parked up and about to open your door into a passing bike. Optionally available, the Driving Assistant Plus package includes adaptive cruise control (shame BMW charges extra for this) and advanced lane-keeping aids, plus automatic speed limit assistance. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems The old BMW X2 wasn’t without its problems, just like the X1 it was based on. However, the latest X1 has proved quite dependable, with only one small recall since launch. The iX1 hasn’t had any specific recalls, and as an EV it has fewer moving parts to worry about or to service. So good signs for the reliability of the iX2. BMW’s standard warranty is just three years but unlimited mileage, making it useful for those who do lots of long journeys. It’s about on par with the warranties from Mercedes or Audi, but some Korean and Japanese brands do offer much longer coverage. BMW also offers eight years and 100,000 miles of cover for the battery, which is about standard."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/2-series-coupe,BMW 2 Series Coupe Review & Prices,"€50,804",8/10,new,"Is the BMW 2 Series Coupe a good car? Is the BMW 2 Series Coupe a good car? They say good things come in small packages – well, the BMW 2 Series Coupe must be a very good thing, because while cars keep getting bigger and bigger, it has remained impressively dainty by comparison. It’s like a tricky winger on a football pitch of lumbering centre backs. As such, there aren’t too many obvious alternatives to consider beyond the Audi TT . The Toyota GR86 is cheaper (if you can find one) but has a sportier focus and less fancy interior, while the Toyota Supra and Ford Mustang are a good chunk more expensive. You wouldn’t immediately know it from looking at the BMW 2 Series, though. It looks fantastic (from the front, at least) with bulging bodywork and narrow, focused headlights that leave no doubts about its sporty character. The back is a bit more aesthetically challenging, a touch reminiscent of Sid the sloth from the Ice Age movies… It’s more conventional inside, though personal preference will determine whether that’s a good thing or not, because the design is a touch plain. There can be no complaints about the interior’s quality, with everything feeling well put together and posh to the touch. The infotainment system is top notch, too. By two-door coupe standards the 2 Series is fairly practical, but it’s not for people who regularly drive around with a car full of mates. There are small cubby holes here and there and a space to wirelessly charge your phone, and while passenger space up front is decent, those in the back will find it rather tighter. At least the boot, at 390 litres, is bigger than the Audi TT, and beaten only by the Ford Mustang. Cars like this are not bought for their practicality, they’re bought for putting a smile on your face out on the open road, and here the BMW 2 Series delivers. There are two petrol engines, called 220i and 230i at 184hp and 245hp respectively (as well as the sportier M240i and M2 models reviewed separately), and the 230i we tested delivered strong acceleration to go with the impressive levels of grip in corners. Okay, so it’s not a proper hardcore sports car, but if you’re looking for a fun road car the 2 Series is a fantastic option. Its diminutive stature means it’s not intimidating to thread down a tight country road and the car turns into corners quickly, so it’s fun and responsive even at normal speeds. It’s a bit jiggly over bumps, but forward visibility is good and the controls are pretty light, so if you’re willing to sacrifice a little comfort, it’s easy to drive around town. There’s a bit of road noise at motorway speeds, but nothing intrusive enough to be annoying.

The BMW 2 Series Coupe is priced directly in line with the Audi TT, though that model is a bit more powerful. The entry-level 220i starts at about £37,000 and it’s about £4,000 more for the 230i. The sportier M240i is more again at around £50,000. The Toyota GR86 is about £5,000-£10,000 less expensive than the non-M BMW, depending on the version, but they’re difficult to come by, have a sportier focus and a more basic interior. Like the GR86, you can get the Toyota Supra and Ford Mustang with a manual transmission, though both of these models are considerably more expensive than the 2 Series, to the tune of £15,000-plus. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort The BMW 2 Series is great to drive down a twisty road, but it’s not mega-comfortable around town The BMW 2 Series Coupe is small so it’s easy to navigate through tight streets. You sit quite low in the car, forward visibility is good, though it’s not quite as simple to see out of the back. Comfort isn’t too bad, but the sports suspension means there’s definitely a bit more jiggling over bumps than you would get with a less sporty model. This is something of an expected compromise with this type of car, and it’s a similar story with the Audi TT – and in both cases, the bigger alloy wheel choice will reduce comfort. Perhaps surprisingly, the M240i can be more comfortable around town, because you can upgrade to the adaptive suspension system. This lets you choose a comfort-focused suspension when you want it, whereas the regular 2 Series only gets the standard, firmer, do-it-all setup. While the lack of a manual transmission might be disappointing for driver involvement on a twisty road, the automatic is better-suited to driving in stop-start traffic. Whichever model you go for, the BMW 2 Series has enough performance to make getting up to motorway speeds or pulling off overtakes easy enough. The automatic gearbox is pretty quick to change gears when you put your foot down and need more power, while shifts are nearly imperceptible in regular driving. Because it’s pretty small, the 2 Series doesn’t come packed full of heavy sound deadening materials, and coupled with the big alloy wheels means there is a bit of road noise to contend with on long motorway drives. Fortunately, the engines all settle down quietly at a cruise, so it’s not like you’re shouting at your passenger to be heard or having to turn the radio up to 11. The M2 and M240i, with their sporty upgrades and shouty six-cylinder engines, are the highlight of the 2 Series range for keen drivers. But the regular 2 Series models are by no means poor relations. Helped by the fact it’s pretty small, so you’re not constantly worried about keeping between the white lines, the 2 Series is great fun to drive down a winding country road. The 230i that we tested has more than enough power to make the most of the excellent cornering ability, too, by giving you oomph out of the bend. Turn into a corner and the front wheels respond quickly, giving the car a sporty feel, plus there’s loads of grip from the tyres and the body stays reassuringly flat. It’s definitely more of a baby sports car than a comfortable weekend cruiser. Space and practicality Space and practicality Front seat space is pretty good, but those in the back will find things a bit more claustrophobic There’s no getting away from the fact that the BMW 2 Series is a small car . Therein lies much of its appeal, but that does mean interior space is rather limited. To be fair, those in the front are pretty well-served by small sports car standards, with decent headroom and enough movement in the seats to get comfortable. It’s hardly spacious though. Storage isn’t too bad, with door bins that can just about take a water bottle, and an area beneath the armrest that’s quite wide but shallow. There are a couple of cupholders, but when you have coffee cups in place they block access to the wireless phone charging bay, which is annoying. Although the BMW 2 Series is technically a four-seater, it’s best thought of as a 2+2. It’s a bit more spacious in the back than an Audi TT, and has the advantage of at least having some rear seat space, unlike the likes of the Porsche Cayman . However, it’s not spacious enough that friends and family will be happy to sit in the back for hours on end, particularly if those in front are tall and need to push the seats back. Legroom isn’t terrible, but the cut-outs in the seats in front are positioned awkwardly, so you’re forced to sit very upright. Six-footers will be brushing their heads on the roof, too. There’s not much in the way of storage either, just the seatback pockets and a shallow area for small bits, though you do get a couple of USB-C ports. Fitting a child seat is possible, but not recommended for regular use. There are ISOFIX mounting points in the outer rear chairs, but you have to fold the front seat forward to get access, then lean in and pass the baby through a small space. If you have a small child the 2 Series should remain strictly in ‘second car’ territory, unless you’re really committed to its cause… Compared with other small sports cars, the BMW 2 Series’ 390-litre boot capacity is positively cavernous. Okay, maybe not quite, but it’s comfortably larger than the 305 litres you get in the Audi TT. The Toyota GR86 and Supra offer even less, at 226 and 290 litres respectively. Only the Ford Mustang beats it at 408 litres, and that’s a much bigger car. Despite its decent capacity, the 2 Series’ boot isn’t particularly easy to access. The aperture is a bit small and it sits quite low, so you have to reach down to pick things up and lift them over the prominent lip. You can fold the rear seats by pulling a latch on the roof of the boot to open a bit more space. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories The BMW 2 Series’ interior is well-made and you get a great infotainment system, but its design isn’t particularly exciting Drop into the driver’s seat of the BMW 2 Series and the interior feels like it wraps around you, with the dashboard angled towards the driver. It feels instantly sporty, and the simple design and high quality materials give it an upmarket edge worthy of the posh BMW badge embossed within the steering wheel. However, its simplicity is also its undoing, because the Audi TT is a much flashier prospect, with its big digital instrument display and circular air vents. Regardless, the 2 Series is a lovely place to sit, because everything you touch feels of the highest quality, and BMW’s infotainment system is one of the best of any car maker. You get a 14.9-inch display on the dashboard that has sharp graphics and responds quickly to your inputs, with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto for easy smartphone integration. It’s actually not the latest BMW system (as seen in the iX and 5 Series , among others), but that’s actually a good thing, because it’s easier to use and means you get physical climate buttons. The 12.3-inch instrument screen displays all the information you need clearly and its menus are intuitively laid out, but there’s no denying it’s overshadowed by the TT’s high-tech setup. There are a few useful option packs worth considering, such as the comfort pack that adds keyless entry, electric memory seats and a heated steering wheel. There’s also an electric glass sunroof that makes the interior more light and airy, while music fans should go for the excellent Harman Kardon sound system – though it’s certainly not cheap. MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax There are two petrol engines offered with the regular 2 Series, dubbed 220i and 230i, with both having a smooth eight-speed automatic gearbox . There’s also the sportier M240i and M2 if you want more performance. Sticking with the regular models, both use a 2.0-litre four-cylinder petrol engine, with the 220i making 184hp and the 230i producing 245hp. Both are rear-wheel drive, but the more powerful model gets from 0-62mph in 5.9 seconds, compared with 7.5 seconds for the 220i. The flip side is that the 220i is more economical, but only just, achieving up to 44.1mpg compared with 42.8mpg in the 230i. We drove the latter, and got impressively close to the official figures at 39.5mpg over a week of mixed driving. This also means that the 220i is a bit cheaper to tax, though both sit at the upper end of the company car tax bands. Safety and security Safety and security The BMW 2 Series was put through safety testing by Euro NCAP and scored a disappointing four-out-five stars. Its adult and child occupant scores weren’t too bad at 82% and 81% respectively, but its vulnerable road user and safety assist systems were rated poorly. Its assistance tech struggled in particular with spotting cyclists and pedestrians crossing the road, but the 2 Series was largely commended for passenger safety in a crash. Standard safety kit includes Active Guard Plus, which pops the bonnet up when a collision with a pedestrian is detected to create further distance to solid objects in the engine bay that could cause injuries. You also get front and rear parking sensors and cruise control. Adding the Technology Pack brings an automatic parking system, while you can also add adaptive cruise control and lane-keeping assistance. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems Ownership surveys indicate that the BMW 2 Series is one of the more reliable sports cars you can buy, with many owners commenting on how it’s one of, if not the most reliable BMW. There are very few tales of major issues, with most problems appearing to be minor and fixed under warranty. Speaking of which, you get the standard BMW warranty with the 2 Series, which is three years and unlimited mileage. That makes it a bit better than average, as most car manufacturers offer warranties for the same time period but put a limit on miles, although Toyota has a 10-year warranty if you maintain the car within its dealer network."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/ix1,BMW iX1 Review & Prices,"€59,576",8/10,new,"Is the BMW iX1 a good car? Is the BMW iX1 a good car? The BMW iX1 is the German brand’s all-electric version of the ever-popular X1 SUV. The iX1 takes inspiration from the bulkier BMW iX flagship, while being the most compact family option of BMW's electric SUVs . It’s like getting the latest phone that’s one step down from the most advanced version but still on trend. Coming with the same exterior design as the latest X1, there are some blue tweaks alongside the kidney grille and angular headlights to mark out the electric version, but it's all very subtle. Sportier models also come with a more aggressive design. You get angular rear lights too with a 3D effect, plus a large rear window and sporty elements, such as the roof spoiler and low-end diffuser. Inside, there are few buttons cluttering the cabin – although that does mean you get fiddly infotainment and climate controls thanks to too many switches being removed. There’s also no iDrive control dial, which means you have to do all major functions through the touchscreen . The design is pleasing on the whole though, with soft materials used up high and on all the main touch points. In the back there’s a decent amount of space, with good head and knee room. Although quality on the whole is fine, it takes a step down from the front part of the cabin. That being said, it still feels like a top product. Range: 267-322 miles Efficiency: 3.5-4.0 miles per kWh Battery size: 67kWh Max charge speed: 130kW Charge time AC: 10hrs, 0-100% at 7kW Charge time DC: 29 mins, 10-80% at 130kW Charge port location: Right rear Power outputs: 201hp / 308hp Practicality-wise, the iX1 also holds its own, with an impressive 490-litre boot – only 10 litres less than the flagship iX. That being said, the boot is marginally smaller than that of the Audi Q4 e-tron , though larger than that of the Volvo XC40 Recharge . The iX1 comes with a pair of model options, both powered by the same 65kWh motor. The more powerful is the 313hp all-wheel drive xDrive30 complete with two electric motors, with one mounted on each axle for all-wheel drive. You get an official range of up to 270 miles, with the top M Sport having a slightly reduced max range of 267 miles. Then there's the front-wheel drive 204hp eDrive20 with a range of up to 294 miles. When you’re driving, it’s odd how much the iX1 feels like driving the much larger iX. The overall experience is refined and quiet, with little disruption from the outside world in terms of noise. It’s comfortable while cruising, but weighing over two tonnes contributes to the fact that you will feel some bumps through the cabin. Around town is where the iX1 impresses most, as it is super quiet and with great visibility all round, you shouldn’t get caught out. The steering is light for easy manoeuvring, while it also doesn’t feel too big. The 'B' drive mode increases brake regen but doesn’t provide full one-pedal drive. Twistier roads do show up the weight again, as there's some lean through the bends if you’re going at higher speeds. But the steering, although lacking feel, is direct and you have plenty of grip. The iX1 feels remarkably composed and capable, and should be the benchmark if you’re in the market for an electric family SUV. It’s a shame that it’s rather expensive though. You'll want to check out the latest BMW iX1 deals on Carwow, then, to see how much you could save. There are also great deals on used iX1s , as well as other used BMWs . If you’re also interested in changing your car altogether, you can sell your car through Carwow, with dealers bidding on your car so you can get the best price. How much is the BMW iX1? How much is the BMW iX1? The iX1 is competitively priced when you compare it with small electric SUVs from the likes of Audi , Volvo and Mercedes , although there’s a bit of divergence in terms of performance and battery size. For example, the Volvo XC40 Recharge is a touch more expensive at the top end of the model line-ups, but offers both more power and a larger battery so therefore longer range. Whereas the Mercedes EQA 350 AMG Line is slightly more expensive, but less powerful and has a smaller battery. It pays to check the specs if you’re looking for a small premium electric SUV and make sure the car you’re going for ticks your range and performance boxes, as well as style, practicality and badge appeal. Unless you want a Tesla , as the Model Y has plenty of space and an excellent official range figure for a price that undercuts the premium brands mentioned here. It’s a jump of almost £6,000 to go from the two-wheel drive eDrive20 model up to the all-wheel drive xDrive30 iX1, which adds another 83hp but knocks in the region of 20 miles off the official range figure, depending on specification. The step from Sport to X Line spec on the two-wheel drive car is £2,000, mainly bringing large-scale cosmetic upgrades that make the car look less plain, while the jump to the M Sport range-topper is slightly more and adds sports seats and nicer alloy wheels among other goodies. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort The iX1 is quiet and refined on the motorway, but around town you feel every bump in the road Electric vehicles tend to be at their best in town, where silent relaxed progress can be made, and the stop-start nature of driving helps the efficiency. The iX1 has those relaxed silent round-town qualities, and is an easy car to pilot around crowded streets. The only hindrance to good all-round visibility is a thick rear pillar. But the BMW struggles a little with a road that’s not smooth, particularly broken surfaces where it makes sure you know about every bump. It’s certainly not a car designed to cushion and cosset its occupants. It doesn’t thump horribly over bumps, just alerts you to every surface change or hole in the road. It’s also a shame that there aren’t more stages to the brake energy regeneration system. While some EVs are able to come to a complete halt without needing to use the brake pedal, the iX1 has a milder and less intrusive version. Some may prefer that but it’s a shame the maximum setting isn’t stronger. The iX1 is impressively quiet and refined on the motorway. Electric cars ’ road and wind noise can sometimes be amplified by the lack of engine rumble, but that’s not the case here, bar a minimal amount of tyre noise. At higher speeds, a lot of that bumpy around-town feeling seems to smooth out too. Efficiency drops as the speed rises, as with all EVs, but it’s a capable and happy long-distance companion - allowing for charging stops. But when you are public charging, the iX1’s maximum charge speed is 130kW, which isn’t particularly fast. Volvo and Tesla in particular are well ahead for maximum charge speed. All BMWs feel more at home than the average EV SUV when the road goes twisty, but you can feel the additional weight in what isn’t a big car when you try and push the speed up on a country road. It just doesn’t feel as nimble as smaller BMWs are supposed to be. But it’s nothing serious, and if you’re not an enthusiastic driver then it’s unlikely to be a big deal. Flick to the sport setting and you get slightly heavier steering and improved throttle response making it a bit more lively. But it’s still nowhere near as much fun as you’d have in a BMW 1 Series hatchback. Space and practicality Space and practicality Decent boot space, but the back seats aren’t the most accommodating for adults Up-front, the comfortable and supportive seats have a good range of adjustment, including BMW’s hallmark cushion that pops out for more under-thigh support. You get a pair of USB-C sockets and a 12V power supply, and there’s a big open stowage area at floor level. There’s an odd storage spot under the armrest though, it’s too small for a smartphone and opens towards the passenger so you’ll have to reach over the top from the driver’s seat. The armrest itself is also fixed rather than adjustable. The door bins are deep but not lined so anything small you put in there will slide around noisily, and the pair of cupholders are rubber-bottomed so help keep cans or bottles stable. There’s also a decent amount of space in the glovebox. The optional wireless charging pad almost acts as a phone display case, angling the screen up towards the driver. Whether that’s good or bad, we’ll leave you to decide for yourself, as you can see the screen rather than it being tucked away flat like most charging pads. If the front passengers are reasonably tall you’ll find yourself a little light on legroom in the back, not helped by the hard seat backs that aren’t particularly pleasant to rub your knees against. Headroom is good enough though, thanks to the iX1’s SUV shape, and you’ll also find a pair of USB-C sockets and some chunky door bins in the rear as well as a netted area in the back of each front seat. The middle of the rear seats isn’t the place to be though; a slight rise between the two outer ones means you’re on a rounded cushion, and despite being an EV, there’s no flat floor in the back - there’s a plastic moulding to straddle that means that middle passenger will have to stick a foot either side. But you can at least get your feet under the front seats. The BMW iX1 has a decent amount of boot space at 490 litres, rising to 1,495 when you drop the rear seats. That’s favourable compared with the Mercedes EQA (340 litres) and Volvo XC40 Recharge (452 litres), but throw the Audi Q4 e-tron into the mix, and its 520 litres looks good. Until you add the Tesla Model Y and its enormous 854-litre boot space, of course. The iX1 boot offers some nice practical touches, including four bag hooks, a little recessed area for smaller items and a 12V socket. The boot floor is nice and flat to the sill, so it’s easy to slide things in and out. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories Nice interior quality and style, but although the touchscreen is responsive, it’s a shame BMW has taken out the rotary controller The cabin materials and overall appearance emphasise that the iX1 is still a premium product despite its smaller dimensions, with a good mix of materials and colours brightening things up where BMWs can sometimes be a little dark. There are some harder plastics at knee level, but further up, the bits you see and touch are all nice. Even though it’s a decent size at 10.7 inches, the touchscreen doesn’t dominate the cabin like some cars do, such as the Tesla Model Y or Ford Mustang Mach-e . But it is very responsive to the touch, and it’s still one of the more user-friendly systems, despite BMW sacrificing the handy rotary controller between the front seats at the altar of tidying up the cabin. Gadget-wise, the iX1 enforces BMW’s reputation for liking you to tick an options box or two, with tech such as keyless entry, wireless phone charging, adaptive LED headlamps and a head-up display all on the extras list. Electric range, charging and tax Electric range, charging and tax The BMW iX1 offers an electric range of up to approximately 267 to 322 miles on a full charge, depending on the model and driving conditions. There are two power options for the BMW iX1. You can either have it in 204hp front-wheel drive eDrive 20 form, or add another motor to the rear wheels and you end up with the 313hp xDrive model. The 0-62mph acceleration time drops by a hefty three seconds with the all-wheel drive car, although the range is down from a maximum of 294 miles on the cheaper and less powerful model to a best of 270 miles on the xDrive. That’s not great when you look at Tesla and Volvo being able to offer cars with bigger batteries and therefore both over 330 miles on the official test, while Audi’s Q4 e-tron is also above 300 miles in comparable ‘50’-badged form. Efficiency also drops from up to 4.0 miles per kWh, depending on specification, to a best of 3.7 mi/kWh when you go for the extra power. But that’s still a good result, being slightly more efficient than the 3.5 of the Audi Q4 e-tron or 3.4 of Mercedes’ EQA, although Tesla’s Model Y Long Range matches it at 3.7 miles/kWh. Charging speed is another area where the iX1 fails to lead the pack, with a best speed of 130kW, which is up on the Mercedes EQA’s poor 100kW, but the Audi Q4 e-tron can take it slightly faster at 135kW, and then there’s a big jump to Volvo’s 200kW and Tesla’s 250kW. But, like all electric vehicles, there are cost savings in terms of vastly reduced road tax , and company car drivers will save a fortune compared to a plug-in hybrid or especially a petrol X1 model. Safety and security Safety and security The latest iX1 and X1 models haven’t been tested by safety expert Euro NCAP as yet, but all cars get a driver attentiveness assistant and lane assist, as well as front and rear parking sensors and a parking camera. Clever tech like a head-up display and adaptive cruise control are pricey options. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems BMW’s reliability record isn’t up with the absolute best in the industry, but neither is it down near the bottom, and with EVs’ reduced moving parts, you should hopefully find minimal problems with your iX1. BMW’s regular three-year warranty with unlimited mileage restriction is alive and well here - it’s not as much as Kia or Hyundai offer (or Lexus with annual servicing at its dealer network), but at least it’s beyond the three-year/60,000-mile bare minimum. The EV battery warranty runs to eight years or 100,000 miles, at which time BMW guarantees 66.5% of capacity. BMW iX1 FAQs BMW iX1 FAQs"
https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/x3-m,BMW X3 M Competition Review & Prices,"€48,953",8/10,used,"Is the BMW X3 M Competition a good car? Is the BMW X3 M Competition a good car? BMW’s engineers deserve a lie-down. Why? Because they needed to ensure the BMW X3 M Competition took your breath away in a sprint, put a smile on your face around a racetrack, didn’t embarrass you off-road and could carry everything your family and everything they need in style and comfort. That’s a busy schedule, but on this evidence, they’ve managed it. They’re not the only tired engineers around, mind. The Mercedes-AMG GLC 63 S , Alfa Romeo Stelvio Quadrofoglio and Audi SQ5 all exist the meet the same , albeit niche, requirements. And remember, there’s also a BMW X4 M Competition if you’re happy to sacrifice some practicality for a sleeker silhouette. Now, there’s no mistaking an X3 M Competition for just any old X3. It gets a gloss black grille, aggressive M front bumper with huge air intakes and BMW’s bold Icon LED headlights at the front. At the sides, you’ll find 21-inch M-specific alloy wheels over larger M brakes and M door mirrors finished in gloss black, while at the rear, there’s another M bumper with diffuser, M sports exhaust with gloss black tailpipes, M Competition badging and rear roof spoiler. Inside you’re treated to figure-hugging electric, heated M Sport seats in fancy Merino leather that come with five free leather colour choices as well as one two-tone as an option. Then there’s an M Sports steering wheel with two red M driving mode buttons, a red starter button, door sill finishers in gloss black, M seatbelts and a newly designed M gear selector. The X3 M’s interior leaves you in no doubt as to its sporting intentions, then, but it’s also very high quality throughout. Plus, BMW’s last generation (but still fantastic) iDrive infotainment system with a 10-inch screen on the dash, digital dials and head-up display with M-specific design and driving mode info is all standard. BMW still doesn’t include Apple CarPlay as standard, though, and Android Auto isn’t even available. Space in the front and rear of the X3 M is very generous. In the back, there’s more headroom than you get in an Audi SQ5 and there’s enough leg room for a six-foot-tall passenger to sit behind an equally tall driver without complaints. The X3M has 550 litres of boot space – the same amount as an Audi SQ5 and Mercedes GLC 63 S – while its completely flat floor makes it easy to slide in heavy luggage and its wide, square opening makes loading bulky items dead easy. The X3 M is fitted with BMW’s savage twin-turbocharged 3.0-litre straight-six petrol which develops a colossal 510hp. Via a brilliant standard eight-speed automatic gearbox and clever all-wheel-drive system, that allows an 0-62mph time of just 4.1 seconds That’s officially slightly slower than a Mercedes-AMG GLC 63 S, although we managed under four seconds when we tried it ourselves, so in reality, there’s barely any gap. The BMW is also every bit as great as the Mercedes at going around corners for such a big SUV. Thanks to that clever all-wheel-drive system , a trick rear differential that distributes power to the rear wheel with the most grip, a stiffened body and stiffer suspension, it turns into corners keenly and remains composed throughout. It’ll even break traction and get playful if you want to explore its limits further. It’s no BMW M3 in the bends, but it isn’t far off.

https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/i8,BMW i8 Review and Prices,"€130,359",7/10,new,"The BMW i8 is a futuristic supercar that proves environmentally friendly hybrids needn’t be boring. A powerful turbocharged petrol engine and high-tech electric motor work together to deliver serious performance while some look-at-me styling makes sure you’ll get noticed everywhere from Kensington High Street to a Green Party conference. The i8 first went on sale in 2014, but received a more powerful electric motor and a boosted electric range in 2018. The BMW’s bonkers styling remains unchanged, but it still looks more dramatic than the likes of the Honda NSX and Audi R8 – especially with the upwards-hinging doors spread wide open. Things are a little less theatrical inside, but you still get a smart minimalist interior with loads of plush materials and a digital driver’s display instead of conventional dials as standard. Unlike most supercars, the BMW i8 comes with four seats which help make it surprisingly easy to live with. Sure, there isn’t space in the 154-litre boot for a set of golf clubs, but it’s bigger than the loadbay you get in the Audi and there’s plenty of space in the BMW’s front seats for you to get comfy if you’re more than six-foot tall. The i8 is one of the quietest and most environmentally friendly supercars around, but it’s certainly not a car for shrinking violets – just check out those ludicrous doors! The i8 is more relaxing to drive than most conventional supercars, too – thanks, in part, to its eerily quiet electric motor and fairly comfortable suspension. Visibility is reasonably good, too, so it isn’t particularly difficult to drive around town and you don’t hear much annoying wind or tyre noise at motorway speeds. Stick it in sport mode, however, and things get a little rowdier. The three-cylinder turbocharged petrol engine whirrs into life and the i8’s speakers pipe synthesised engine sounds into the cabin. It’s not quite as exhilarating as hearing a 5.2-litre V10 screaming away behind you like in an R8, but the instant shove from its electric motor means the BMW i8 will sprint from 0-62mph in a still-pretty-blooming-exciting 4.4 seconds. That’s faster than a Porsche 911 Carrera 4. Extensive use of lightweight carbon fibre helps make the i8 as agile as possible on a twisty country road, too, as well as maximising its electric-only range. A three-hour charge from a dedicated wall charger lets you cruise around almost silently for around 30 miles and at up to 75mph. Once you’ve run out of electrical juice, the petrol engine chimes in automatically to push you along and recharge the batteries at the same time. This means that – unlike in many electric cars – you’ll never have to worry about range-anxiety in the BMW i8. Also helping put your mind at rest are the numerous safety features you get as standard, including automatic emergency braking that’ll hit the brakes if the car senses an obstacle in the road ahead. It’s not the most exciting supercar to drive, but the i8 is an extremely accomplished sports hybrid and a worthy alternative to the likes of the more conventional Porsche 911 and the more expensive Honda NSX."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/i8-roadster,BMW i8 Roadster Review and Prices,"€148,842",8/10,new,"The BMW i8 Roadster is a convertible version of the futuristic i8 Coupe. It packs supercar-like performance into an eye-catching package that’s sure to attract even more attention at the local petrol station than the likes of the Honda NSX and Audi R8 Spyder. Not that you’ll need to refuel the i8 Roadster very often – it is a hybrid after all. Fully charge its batteries (which you can do in three hours using a dedicated wall charger) and you can drive for around 30 miles in electric-only mode. When the batteries have run out of juice – or put your foot down to accelerate hard – the 1.5-litre turbo petrol engine starts up instantly to lend a hand. Together, they produce 374hp – enough to sprint the i8 Roadster from 0-62mph in 4.6 seconds and on to a 155mph top speed. In Sport mode, the petrol engine stays running the whole time which helps make the BMW feel even more responsive on a twisty country road. As an added bonus, it also recharges the batteries on the move and produces some sporty crackles and wooshes that sound terrific – especially with the roof down. If it starts raining, don’t worry – you can raise the roof electrically at up to 30mph. It does an excellent job of muting any unpleasant wind noise at motorway speeds and leaves enough headroom inside for you to get comfortable, even if you’re over six-feet tall. The Roadster’s frenetic 1.5-litre petrol engine makes it sound a bit like you’re being chased by an irate hot hatch every time you push the accelerator – especially with the roof down Speaking of space inside, the i8 Roadster doesn’t get a pair of back seats like the coupe. Instead, you get a more usable luggage storage shelf that’s big enough to carry three large soft bags. Combine this with an extra storage bin under the BMW’s engine cover and you actually get slightly more luggage space in the Roadster than in the hard-top. Identical to the coupe, however, is the roadster’s cabin design. Its simple, minimalist layout means everything’s easy to use and plenty of plush leather and brushed metal trims make sure it feels much posher inside than the likes of the Honda NSX. You also get one of the most intuitive infotainment systems around and a cool digital driver’s display instead of conventional analogue dials as standard. Other high-tech features fitted as standard include automatic emergency braking that’ll perform an emergency stop if it detects an obstacle in the road ahead. The i8 hasn’t been crash-tested by Euro NCAP, but features such as this help make it a very safe sports car, and one of the very best hybrid performance cars on sale."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/m2,BMW M2 Review & Prices,"€81,512",9/10,new,"Is the BMW M2 a good car? Is the BMW M2 a good car? The new M2 is BMW doing what it does best. It’s a small, front-engined, rear-wheel drive sports car that will bring a smile to the face of any petrolhead. If the BMW M240i is an iPhone 14, the M2 is the full-fat iPhone 14 Pro Max. You’ll probably be considering the M2 if you’re also looking at hardcore performance cars such as the Mercedes-AMG CLA 45 S and Audi RS3 , or even premium-badged sports cars like the Porsche 718 Cayman . You won’t be mistaking the M2 for a standard 2 Series Coupe in a hurry. It has a much more aggressive-looking front bumper, huge flared wheel arches and a deeper rear bumper with quad tailpipes, as well as 19-inch alloys up front and 20-inch wheels at the rear. Under the bonnet you’ll find the same 3.0-litre twin-turbocharged six-cylinder engine as the BMW M3 and M4 but with less power. It puts out 460hp and 550Nm of torque, enough for a 0-60mph sprint time of 4.1 seconds. We managed to beat that with an impressive 3.9 seconds, though. If you’re looking at an M2 you’ll probably appreciate some nerdy details. It gets M4/M3 axles to increase its width and a limited-slip differential to help it put the power down out of a corner. It has stiffer suspension springs, adaptive dampers as standard and anti-roll bars to improve handling. Right, enough nerding out. What else do you need to know? Well, one way the M2 separates itself from the cheaper M240i is that it’s available with a six-speed manual gearbox, making it one of the only hardcore performance cars left with three pedals. Unlike the M240i, the M2 is only available with rear-wheel-drive rather than all-wheel power delivery. While we admire BMW for keeping the manual alive, we actually prefer the eight-speed automatic here. It shifts quickly and makes the M2 easier to drive in traffic, while the manual has a rubbery shift action that’s not particularly satisfying to use. Still, it gives the M2 a unique selling point next to the auto- and all-wheel drive-only Mercedes -AMG CLA 45 S and Audi RS3. Although the M2 gets slightly firmer suspension than other 2 Series models, it deals with bumps in the road really well, so you don’t have to sacrifice too much comfort in day to day driving. Visibility in the 2 Series Coupe is decent too, and the M2 gets a reversing camera as standard to make parking manoeuvres that bit easier. What about the practical stuff? After all, a car like this needs to work on the weekly shopping trip and boring commute, too. Up front the M2 is plenty spacious enough, with the standard seats offering loads of adjustability to get comfortable. If you want to up the sportiness, the M2 is available with some lovely-looking carbon fibre bucket seats. These are the same as those offered in the BMW M3, which hold you in place really well. You might find they’re rather snug if you have a larger build, while the ridge between your legs can be annoying if you indulge in some heel-and-toe action in the manual. Space in the rear is pretty good for a sporty coupe, with a couple of adults able to sit comfortably, though they might feel a bit cramped for longer journeys. Those looking to carry people in the back regularly will be much better off with a four-door Audi RS3, which has both Sportback (i.e. hatchback ) and Saloon body styles. As for boot space, there’s 390 litres on offer in the M2. That’s 70 litres less than the Mercedes-AMG CLA 45 S, however it is 59 litres more than you get in an Audi RS3 saloon. Interior storage is also decent, with a useful centre console cubby, a decent-sized glovebox and some usable cup holders. The cabin itself is more or less identical to the M240i, with the exception of a manual gear stick poking out of the centre console, if you go for that option. This means everything feels really solid, with plenty of soft-touch materials around the place and a modern design. That said, a Porsche Cayman feels a bit more special. The new BMW M2 gets a huge, curved display that dominates the dash. It consists of a 12.3-inch digital driver’s display and a 14.9-inch central touchscreen, the same as you’ll find in most new BMW models these days. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto both come as standard, and the system is really easy to use. You have the option to use it as a touchscreen, which is better while you're stationary, or there’s a choice of voice commands or a swivel wheel in the centre console, which work better while driving. The BMW M2 is a fantastic sports car, and although its price (and weight) have swelled, it goes a long way to justify that with a fantastic driving experience. Want one? Check out the latest BMW M2 deals . You can also browse a range of used BMWs through Carwow, or take a look at used examples of the outgoing M2 . If you’re looking to sell your car first, Carwow can help with that, too. How much is the BMW M2? How much is the BMW M2? Everything is getting more expensive and the BMW M2 is no different. Starting at a snip below £65,000 means it’s the most expensive car among its premium performance competition, with the AMG A45 S the closest at around £63,000. The Audi RS3 and TT RS both hover around £60,000 and you can get into a Porsche Cayman for considerably less. The sportier Cayman GTS will set you back around £69,000, but even though it has a bit less power than the BMW, it will feel more special. You do get some good kit for your cash, with all the clever mechanical stuff that makes the M2 so fun to drive, as well as a fancy Harman Kardon sound system, adaptive LED headlights and an M steering wheel. You don’t get adaptive cruise control as standard (and not at all on manual models), which is surprising for such a pricey, premium car. And if you want the cool carbon bucket seats you’ll have to pay an extra £7,000 for an option pack that also adds a carbon roof and carbon fibre trim pieces inside. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort The BMW M2 is an absolute joy to drive fast and does the relaxing stuff well too, but tyre noise can be a bit loud at higher speeds With its stiffer suspension and body bracing, you might expect the M2 to hop, skip and jump its way across town. But with adaptive dampers as standard you can select ‘comfort’ mode to soften things up a bit. Do this, and the car deals with bumps really well. If comfort is your priority you’d be better off with a regular 2 Series, but if you want The Fast One and were concerned that your back would give out on the way to the shops, may your fears be allayed. It’s in town that the auto gearbox is the better bet, too. In its least aggressive settings it switches between gears with little fuss, and helps you relax in traffic. Being a relatively small car with a sporty suspension setup, the M2 is not built for long motorway drives. However, put it in its comfiest drive mode and, again, it’s perfectly acceptable for your daily duties. Perhaps the only complaint we have here is that the grippy tyres and large alloy wheels mean you get quite a bit of road noise in the cabin. It’s not unbearable, though. What’s more annoying is the lack of adaptive cruise control as standard. Especially when you notice it costs more than £1,000 as part of a package of extra driver assistance tech. When the road starts winding the M2 really comes alive. Where the M3 and M4 can be a bit lairy when you put your foot down, the M2 is much more composed, with lots of grip so you have confidence to press on out of a corner. Despite this it feels a bit more playful and fun than its larger siblings. Again, much of this is down to its lower, less intimidating power output, but also its smaller footprint, which will be particularly noticeable on tight country roads in the English countryside. The steering has a nice weight to it and feels really precise, so you’re confident in putting the front end of the car where you want it. Put the auto gearbox into its most aggressive setting and you’ll feel a noticeable jolt in your back when you shift up. But turn this down and it still changes gear rapidly so you can concentrate on the job of going fast. It does lose a few marks on downshifts though, with these being a bit slower to engage. Opt for the manual and you can ask the car to automatically blip the revs when you change down a gear to keep the engine speed at its optimal level. However, we still prefer the quick-shifting auto over the extra involvement that comes from the manual. BMW’s system isn’t as slick and enjoyable as that found in a Porsche. Space and practicality Space and practicality The BMW M2 has a bigger boot than most others you might consider, but rear seat space is merely average Space in the front is pretty good, with decent adjustability of the seats making it easy to find a comfortable driving position. You sit fairly low but still have a good view of the road ahead and can raise the seat up pretty high if you need to. Regardless of seating position, all you’ll see and feel are high quality materials – even if the design is a bit reserved – with squishy plastics the order of the day. There are also all the usual cubby holes and door bins you would expect, though because of the M2’s smaller dimensions, don’t expect any cavernous, Tardis-like areas to hide all of your belongings. Those in the back seats don’t have it quite so good. The seats are comfortable and there’s some M stitching in the belts to remind you this ain’t no regular 2 Series, but it’s not hugely spacious. Your knees won’t be up around your ears, though. Taller passengers might find their quiff bothers the roof, but generally speaking a couple of adults should be comfortable enough for shorter journeys. Just expect there to be requests for seat rotation on longer road trips, because knee room isn’t fantastic. An Audi RS3 would be a better option if you regularly carry passengers, because it’s a bit more spacious and you can access through the rear doors, which the M2 doesn’t have. Open the boot and you’re presented with 390 litres of storage space, which is exactly the same as the rest of the 2 Series range. There’s no practicality penalty for performance here. What’s more, that actually makes it one of the most practical performance cars amongst its competitors. The Audi RS3 Sportback has a paltry 281 litres because its all-wheel drive system eats into storage space, but even the Saloon only gets 320 litres. The Mercedes-AMG A45 S is closer at 370 litres, but the BMW is only beaten by the CLA 45, which gets 460 litres. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories The M2's twin-screen set-up is high-tech and easy to use, but the interior design isn't as special as you'd find in a Porsche Jump inside the M2 and you’ll be hit by understated quality. In contrast to the brash and boxy exterior, it’s not a particularly shouty interior, more closely aligned with what you’d expect to find in comfy, motorway-mile-friendly BMWs rather than the tyre shredder of the family. Despite this there are plenty of little reminders that this is an M car, with various badges and splashes of the M tricolour all over the place, including on the thick-rimmed steering wheel. There are only quality materials to be found, so even though it looks a bit unexciting, it feels suitably premium. One thing that does jump out at you, though, is the ultra-wide, twin-screen set-up on the dashboard. It’s made up of a 12.3-inch driver’s display and a 14.9-inch infotainment system running the latest BMW tech. That means you get super quick responses and pin-sharp graphics with one of the better voice control systems in the business. You also get Android Auto and Apple CarPlay as standard to stream your music and take advantage of your maps apps. Back to the task of driving fast, and there are a bunch of M-specific apps, such as a lap timer and a drift analyser that will rate your attempts to recreate the Stig’s Top Gear highlight reel. Though obviously you should only engage this when it’s safe to do so… MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax BMW has taken the engine from the bigger M3 and M4 – that’s the one codenamed ‘S58,’ if you want to get geeky again – but with about 50hp and 100Nm of torque less. That means 460hp and 550Nm of torque, resulting in a 0-60mph time of 4.1 seconds (or 4.3 in the manual). You can bump the top speed from its 155mph limit to 180mph with the M Driver’s Pack. That’s a whopping £2,305 option but it does come with some driver training. Still, it’s probably more useful for those whose commute takes in derestricted sections of German autobahn. Enough of the fun stuff, you want to know how much the M2 will cost to run, don’t you? Official figures suggest 27.7mpg in mixed driving, which is almost identical to the M240i’s numbers, so it shouldn’t be ruinous to run if you can resist the urge to enjoy the engine’s talents too often. It also has the same 231g/km CO2 emissions figure, but don’t get too excited – that still puts it in the second-highest tax band for your first year of vehicle excise duty . You’ll also be subject to the premium on top of the regular tax payment in years two to six because the list price is above £40,000. Safety and security Safety and security Although the M2 has not specifically undergone safety testing, the regular 2 Series scored four-out-of-five stars from Euro NCAP . It scored just over 80% for adult and child occupant protection, but its 64% rating for safety assist systems was slightly disappointing. As standard, you get a parking assistant with a rear-view camera and sensors front and rear, a speed limiter and non-adaptive cruise control. The adaptive version, which can adjust your speed to maintain your position in traffic, comes as part of the £1,100 Driving Assistant pack. This adds some extra assistance kit that uses cameras and radars to help prevent crashes, or mitigate the outcomes, including lane departure warning , front collision warning and rear collision prevention. The adaptive cruise isn’t included if you buy a manual. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems As it stands, there are no concerns about M2 reliability because it’s too new for owners to have found any issues. However, the regular 2 Series models appear to be pretty reliable, with no recurring problems cropping up. Despite this, BMW has a mixed reputation for long-term reliability and its parts can be pretty expensive if repairs are needed. For peace of mind you get a three-year, unlimited mileage warranty as standard, which includes roadside assistance. For about £1,600 you can also get BMW Service Inclusive, which covers routine servicing for the first four years after the car is registered."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/i4,BMW i4 Review & Prices,"€72,207",8/10,new,"Is the BMW i4 a good car? Is the BMW i4 a good car? The BMW i4 is like a 4 Series from a decade in the future. It shares a very similar outline, but uses all-electric power and has a slightly bolder design, as well as having a more advanced interior. It certainly won’t fade into the background, as BMW has fitted the huge kidney grille from the 4 Series Gran Coupe that the i4 is based on. In the cabin, the i4 has a plush finish to match other BMW models – it definitely feels more upmarket in here than a Tesla Model 3 , and can match a Polestar 2 . Entry-level models come with cloth seat trim as standard, but leather is also on offer for those wanting a high-end feel. Regardless, it’s a well-built and neatly designed cabin, but the infotainment is the star of the show and features the impressive curved display combining the 12.3-inch instrument and 14.9-inch infotainment screens in one sleek unit. Compared to the 4 Series Gran Coupe, it’s 6mm taller and sits 15mm closer to the road – but remains mostly the same. Taller passengers may struggle to fit in the rear due to the sloping roof line, but knee room is acceptable. As it’s based on a conventional fuel-powered car, there isn’t a flat floor in the footwell, so fitting three adults in will be a struggle. However, the door openings are a good size and it is more than comfortable enough. You’ll be happy to hear that it’s quite spacious in the boot, with the hatchback tailgate opening up to provide a roomy load space. The rear seats fold down to reveal a flat floor, too. The i4 comes in three versions. The entry-level eDrive35 has 282hp and claims up to 299 miles of range, while the eDrive40 ups this to 366 miles courtesy of a larger battery. That version comes with a 340hp rear-mounted electric motor setup that also produces 430Nm. The top-spec i4 M50 version – which was developed by BMW's M division – is fitted with two electric motors. With one fitted on each axle, the M50 comes with four-wheel drive and has a stout 544hp and 795Nm on tap. With the same sized battery as the eDrive40, though, claimed range is reduced to up to 318 miles. Whichever i4 you want, performance isn’t an issue. Even the eDrive35 models can do the sprint to 62mph in 6.0 seconds. But if you want brutal electric acceleration, the M50 gets to 62mph in 3.9 seconds (we bettered that in our video, however). Top speed is 140mph, though, rather than the usual 155, because the range of an EV really suffers at high speed. In town, the i4 feels very comfortable over bumps and cracks in the surface thanks to air suspension at the rear, and it’s pretty nimble as well. M50 models come with adaptive suspension for further comfort, meaning that even the higher-performance model can deal nicely with poorer surfaces. As standard, the i4 features adaptive cruise control and a reversing camera – making driving on the motorway and parking much simpler respectively. Refinement is also excellent throughout the i4 line-up, with only tyre noise making an impression. If the i4 sounds like the model for you, check out our deals page to see what price you can get for this stylish electric four-door. If you're interested in waiting to see some used examples of the BMW i4 then head over to our used BMW i4 page . How much is the BMW i4? How much is the BMW i4? Electric cars tend to cost more than similar petrol and diesel models, and premium-badged cars are pricier than those from humble brands. So it’s no great surprise that the i4 is more expensive to buy than the conventionally powered BMW 3 Series and 4 Series Gran Coupe on which it’s based, or electric models like the Hyundai Ioniq 5 or the Kia EV6 . The cheapest route to i4 ownership is the eDrive35 Sport, but even this costs a shade over £50,000. Go for the range-topping M50 and the price is north of £70,000. That makes it significantly more expensive than the Tesla Model 3, which is tough competition for the i4. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort Quick, quiet, and comfortable, but not as exciting as a BMW M3 The BMW i4 works well around town, and not just because, as an electric car, it produces no exhaust emissions. Whether you go for the for one of the rear-wheel drive models or the four-wheel drive M50, the i4 is very lively from a standing start and will leap towards any gap in traffic. It’s just as happy to be driven gently, with a smoother ride than the Tesla Model 3. Something you’ll really notice if the i4 is your first experience of an electric car is just how quiet it is. With no engine noise you slip through urban traffic in hushed comfort. Slip the transmission into ‘B’ instead of ‘D’ and the car increases the level of regenerative braking, capturing energy that would otherwise be lost when slowing down. In this setting you can almost ignore the brake and drive with one pedal, as the car will come to a complete stop using regenerative braking alone. If you had to pick holes in the way the i4 drives around town, you’d say that all-round visibility could be better. The slinky four-door coupe looks are matched to a low-down driving position, so you’ll see out more easily if you choose an electric SUV instead. Leave town behind and head out on the motorway, and the i4 is right at home. If anything, the quiet of the cabin is even more impressive at high speed, with just some road noise for company. There’s hardly any whine from the electric motor (or motors if you drive the M50) and very little wind noise. Whether you are driving the eDrive40 or the M50, there’s more than enough performance to accelerate quickly after being stuck behind slower traffic. The eDrive35 feels notably slower to accelerate at motorway speeds than its more expensive siblings, but it's only slow in context - it really doesn't lack power. Adaptive cruise control makes for a relaxed drive, even when the road is busy. The BMW is very comfortable on the motorway – it’s much less fidgety than a Tesla Model Y ’s, for example – so long journeys in the i4 are something to look forward to. Like most electric cars, the BMW i4 is heavy. Most of the time it disguises this bulk well, but when you get to a winding country road you do notice that the i4 needs more persuasion to change direction than the likes of a BMW M3 . Some more feel from the steering wouldn’t go amiss, either. That said, you can still enjoy driving the i4. The big tyres grip the road tenaciously and there’s very little lean when cornering. Even the eDrive40 is very quick indeed, while the M50’s acceleration is positively savage. While the entry-level car is rear-wheel drive, the faster model sends power to all four wheels, which helps get its power to the road in wet weather. Space and practicality Space and practicality A decent boot size, but the i4 isn't the roomiest in the back As a four-door coupe, the i4 tries to balance style and practicality. It’s never going to be as practical as a regular saloon , hatchback , or SUV, but for the most part it does a decent job of being roomy and good looking. You’ll have no complaints in the front, where there’s plenty of legroom, sufficient headroom, and a really high standard of fit and finish. The car’s hefty price tag doesn’t weigh so heavily when you look at the curved twin-screens and the excellent materials used throughout. There’s enough storage in the front of the cabin to keep most owners happy, with door bins big enough for a large bottle of water. There’s also a roomy bin beneath the driver’s arm rest, and twin cupholders at the base of the centre console. You sit low to the ground with the seat on its lowest setting, which feels right in such a sporty car. It can be raised higher if you find that more comfortable. In fact, with a good range of adjustment to the seat and wheel, drivers of most shapes and sizes should be able to find a sound and supportive seating position. Front lumbar support comes as part of the optional Comfort Plus Pack or, more affordably, as an individual option. More and more modern electric cars are built from the ground up to be electric and electric only. That’s not the case with the i4, which leads to certain compromises. Because it shares underpinnings with the 3 Series , there needs to be room for a regular engine, transmission, and fuel tank for models that don’t have batteries and an electric motor. Hence the big transmission tunnel, which gets in the way a bit if three try to sit in the back. Legroom is okay for adults, so long as the driver and the passenger sat behind them aren’t too tall. However, headroom is a bit tight – blame the sloping roofline. There are ISOFIX points for mounting child seats. Keep the back seats upright and there’s 470 litres of luggage room. Lift the hatchback and there’s a wide opening for loading up, and only a slight lip to load items over. On the other hand, the parcel shelf is a solid unit that doesn’t lift with the hatchback, although you can always take it out if it gets in the way. Fold the seats down and that space increases to 1,290 litres, and the seat backs lie almost flat. However, you do need to use the catches on the top of the back seat – there’s no lever to pull by the tailgate. The back seats split 60/40, and there’s a central hatch to open if you want to carry long items like skis as well as passengers. Lift the boot floor and you’ll find space for the charging cables. Just remember to get them out before you pack if you’re going on a long journey and will need to recharge on route. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories Impressive tech in a stylish cabin, although no separate climate control buttons any more The outside of the car, with its big kidney grille, isn’t everyone’s pint of pilsner. But you’ll struggle to find anyone who slides behind the driver’s seat of the i4 and isn’t impressed. The dash is dominated by twin screens that curve around the driver to give the appearance of one huge display. We defy you to see them light up for the first time and not say ‘wow!’ Directly in front of the driver in place of conventional dials sits a 12.3-inch screen, which the driver can customise to their heart’s content. To the left is the larger 14.9-inch infotainment screen, which is as sharp and clear as any high-end smartphone’s. The whole twin-screen set-up – Live Cockpit Plus in BMW-speak – runs on the BMW Operating System 8. You can use voice control, or rather you can try to. We’ve found this part of the infotainment system needs a bit more work. Otherwise, the latest version of BMW’s iDrive is the slickest yet, with a choice of touching the screen or using the iDrive rotary controller to move between menus and make selections. The iDrive control is less distracting on the move, and saves smudging fingerprints all over that expensive-looking touchscreen. Perhaps the only area in which BMW’s infotainment has taken a backwards step is in moving the air con controls to the bottom of the screen rather than having separate buttons. If you prefer Apple or Android’s way of doing things to BMW’s, the infotainment is compatible with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and as you’d expect of a recent infotainment system, BMW Operating System 8 is compatible with over-air software updates. Everything you can see or touch in the cabin is of a high quality, from the materials used on the top of the dash to the seat upholstery. A mix of Alcantara and Sensatec is standard on Sport and M Sport models, although the M50 comes with leather included in the price. Electric range, charging and tax Electric range, charging and tax Every BMW i4 is an electric vehicle, so there are no exhaust emissions at all. That’s good for the environment and for your tax bill if you are a company car driver, as the i4 sits in the 2% benefit-in-kind tax bracket for the 2022/23 tax year. If your employer offers you the keys to the i4, your monthly tax bill will cost much the same as a takeaway for four. For private buyers, there’s no Vehicle Excise Duty to pay when the car is first registered or in later years, as a tax break to encourage more drivers to choose electric vehicles. The entry-level i4 is the eDrive35, which has a 70.2kWh battery and a single electric motor at the rear. Official range is 299 miles, which in the real world is likely to be around 240-250. Above this sits the eDrive40 or the twin-motor M50, which both come with the same 83.9 kWh battery. The less powerful eDrive 40 stretches each kWh further than the M50, for an official range of up to 366 miles in Sport spec - or closer to 300 in the real world.. That drops to a maximum of 352 miles if you go for the M Sport spec with its larger wheels. The M50 consumes electricity more quickly, dropping the range to 258-318 miles. Make the most of its performance 0 which is very tempting to do, as it's only a flex of your foot away - and this drops off very quickly. In isolation those are long distances, but it’s worth noting that the Tesla Model 3 Long Range can cover up to 390 miles. In practice, you’ll need a gentle right foot and warm weather to get close to those figures. In winter, batteries don’t like the chilly conditions and so the real-world range will drop, as is the case with all EVs. You should be able to top-up the batteries very quickly, thanks to a maximum charging speed of 205kW for eDrive40 and M50 models. The eDrive35 only tops up at 180kW, but its smaller battery means charging times are comparable. Safety and security Safety and security The i4 has been tested by the safety experts at Euro NCAP and came away with a four-star rating out of five. That’s pretty good, but you get the feeling BMW’s engineers will be kicking themselves that the car didn’t earn the full five stars. Every i4 comes with Driving Assistant. This package uses camera and radar sensors to give the driver warnings and reduce the chance of a collision. As an optional extra, Driving Assistant Professional adds no fewer than 11 extra driver aids. Every i4 comes with a tyre repair kit rather than a spare wheel, which may not bother you in the slightest, but could be a deal-breaker for some drivers. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems Electric cars in general tend to be more reliable than cars with internal combustion engines, as there are fewer moving parts to go wrong. BMW generally sits in the middle of the field in reliability and owner satisfaction surveys, although that does tend to vary from model to model. From new, the i4 comes with a three-year unlimited mileage warranty, or eight years and 100,000 miles in the case of cover for the high-voltage battery. BMW i4 FAQs BMW i4 FAQs"

https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/6-series-gt,BMW 6 Series Gran Turismo Review and Prices,"€63,180",6/10,new,"The BMW 6 Series is a five-door coupe with a boot opening that’s larger than you get in the 5 Series saloon, so it’s ideal if you have a dog but don’t want a dreary estate car. From the driver’s seat, the 6 Series feels like any other BMW – it’s very nice. Plastic quality is excellent – even the bottoms of the doors have quality plastics – and you also get expensive looking trims and mood lighting in the front and back. Naturally, you get a soft leather interior as standard and sat behind the steering wheel the BMW cocoons you as if you were in a sports car. That said, the 6 Series GT’s extra height over the 5 Series saloon means you get a good view over the road ahead, and there’s plenty of space even for exceptionally tall adults. Your back-seat passengers also get plenty of room, and you’ll love the 6 Series GT for its extra rear space compared to the 5 Series saloon. You can fit three adults in the back quite comfortably too. That said, the reason you choose a GT over a BMW 5 Series saloon is because of its larger boot, which is 610 litres in size next to the 530-litre capacity you get in the saloon. The GT’s glassy boot means it can carry dogs and its hatchback-style opening means it also easier to pack full of luggage for big family holidays. Interior storage is also decent thanks to the large pockets on the four passenger doors and the car’s four cupholders. The only slight disappointment is the small size of the glovebox that also houses the ventilation system’s fragrance dispenser. The BMW 6 Series Gran Turismo is comfortable, quick and spacious but it's expensive and not exactly a looker There’s not much to disappoint you about the way the 6 Series drives though. In town, the optional four-wheel steering gives it an extremely tight turning circle, the optional air suspension is very comfortable over bumpy roads and you can set the steering to be light for effortless low-speed manoeuvring. Swap town for country and you can add weight to the steering in Sport mode, to make the car feel more stable going into fast bends, and there’s loads of grip if you need to get a move on. It barely leans in fast bends and on the motorway the cabin is reasonably quiet save for a little bit of tyre roar at the legal limit. Engine noise is well suppressed even if you choose the 3.0-litre diesel. It’s the pick of the range – you can also have 2.0 and 3.0-litre petrols – because it’s smooth, refined and quick, but also capable of returning fuel economy of up to 55.3mpg. With the diesel fitted, the 6 Series GT has a jack-of-all-trades character. It’s posh but also a practical family car and, with the diesel engine fitted, it’s quick and comfortable too."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/ix,BMW iX Review & Prices,"€114,432",9/10,new,"Is the BMW iX a good car? Is the BMW iX a good car? This big, striking SUV is the BMW iX, the German brand’s biggest electric model and an alternative to other luxury SUVs, such as the Polestar 4 and Mercedes EQE SUV . You might also consider it as a posher alternative to the Kia EV9 if you don’t need all that space. An electric family SUV isn’t a particularly wild concept these days, but it seems no one told BMW’s designers. Like so many of the brand’s other cars, the iX has a really striking exterior design. It’s a bit like Marmite – you might love it, you might hate it, but it’s hard not to have an opinion either way. From those sharp lines and creases on its bonnet and wheelarches; to its big alloys, massive, toothy grille and squinty headlights – it’s certainly a very busy-looking design. In white in particular, you could say that it looks like someone crashed the Space Shuttle Discovery into the back of some sort of giant robotic beaver. Someone should probably tell NASA… Its dimensions are more conventional, being roughly comparable to the current X5 SUV on the outside, but with an interior that’s closer to the bigger X7 in terms of the space. And while you won’t get the option of seven seats on this new electric SUV , its cabin doesn’t skimp on any sense of luxury, tech or eco appeal. Range: 259-377 miles Efficiency: 2.8-3.1 miles per kWh Battery size: 74kWh / 108kWh Max charge speed: 250kW Charge time AC: 11hrs, 0-100%, 7kW / 16hrs 15mins, 0-100%, 7kW Charge time DC: 31mins, 10-80%, 250kW / 35 mins, 10-80%, 250kW Charge port location: Right rear Power outputs: 322hp / 516hp / 610hp That tech appeal is emphasised by a pair of huge screens that dominate the cabin. The 12.3-inch instrument panel and 14.9-inch infotainment display combine almost seamlessly to look like one big, curved display – it's an impressive sight from behind the wheel. You get a wireless charge pad, multiple USB-C ports and a range of connected services too. Build quality is top notch, and it’s very practical too with lots of space for five adults to stretch out. Boot space could be a bit more generous, though. With a 500-litre capacity, there’s less room for bags than you’ll find in the Polestar 4. You can choose from three power outputs, depending on whether you are happy with a quick car or you feel the need to warp the fabric of space and time. All three have an electric motor at each axle for all-wheel drive and a battery pack housed low down beneath the floor. The entry-level 326hp xDrive40 model has an official range of up to 264 miles, while the 523hp xDrive50 has a bigger battery that will see it travel up to 383 miles on a charge. If that’s not quick enough for you, the iX M60 has 619hp, a range of up to 349 miles, and a 0-60mph time of under four seconds. The cars have slightly different maximum charge rates (150kW for the xDrive40 and 200kW for the xDrive50 and M60), but the long and short of it is that any iX will be able to use a DC rapid charger to go from 10-80% capacity in less than 40 minutes. Plug in at home with a 7kW charger, and a full recharge will take up to 16 hours. Whichever model you go for, the BMW iX is one of the best electric SUVs to drive. It might be big, but excellent visibility makes it pretty easy to navigate tight city streets, while the air suspension on xDrive50 models smooths out bumps in the road for a comfortable drive. Out on the motorway it's lovely and quiet, making long journeys relaxing, while each of the motor options will get you up to speed quickly. And when you take the iX down a twisty road it swaps serene comfort for surprising agility. This is still a big, heavy SUV, but it's one of the more capable electric SUVs in corners. All models have all-wheel drive, which helps offer reassuring grip as you accelerate out of bends. If this sounds like the car for you, head on over to our BMW iX deals page to see how much money Carwow can save you. You can also get a great deal on a used iX as well as other used BMWs . Want to sell your car online ? Carwow can help with that, too. How much is the BMW iX? How much is the BMW iX? The BMW iX is a luxury SUV with an electric powertrain, so you know it's not going to be cheap. Entry-level xDrive40 Sport models start at around £70,000, and you have to step up to the M Sport trim to access that xDrive50 powertrain, with prices jumping massively to £105,000. It's another big leap to get into the high-performance M60 version, which starts at just under £125,000. That starting price is a bit higher than the Polestar 4 and the bigger Kia EV9, and slightly more than the Porsche Macan Electric , meaning that while it's at the upper end of the price scale it's not wildly pricey. However, if you're looking at xDrive50 models, they are a bit more expensive than slightly bigger SUVs such as the Mercedes EQE SUV and Lotus Eletre , and around the same price as the Volvo EX90 , which starts to make it look quite expensive. The M60 models cost around the same as top-spec, high-performance versions of the EQE SUV and Eletre, though. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort Stunning performance and comfort, especially with air suspension, although the entry car without that tech can make bumps a bit obvious The iX is a huge car, so it takes up a lot of space on a city street. On the other hand, visibility is good and BMW’s excellent surround-camera system is available to take the stress out of parking. In fact, the standard-fit Parking Assistant feature will park the car for you. Being electric, there are no exhaust emissions to harm local air quality, which is a big plus if a lot of your journeys are around town. Another plus to choosing an electric car is the immediate performance from a standing start. Whichever version of the iX you choose, the BMW is quick off the mark to make the most of any gap in traffic. Despite riding on alloy wheels measuring at least 21 inches, the big BMW is comfortable around town, especially if you go for the xDrive 50 which comes with air suspension. You can waft along undisturbed by potholes and other lumps and bumps in the road. The xDrive40 does without air suspension and isn’t quite so forgiving of poor surfaces, but it’s still a comfy way to get around. The thing that really strikes you about the iX on the motorway is just how quiet it is. There’s hardly a flutter of wind noise from the mirrors, and just a faint hum from the big tyres. You hear the sound of other traffic more than you do any noise from the BMW. Whichever iX model you pick, the car will be up to 70mph before you know it. In fact, such is the refinement at speed that you’ll need to keep a very close eye on the speedometer to make sure you don’t go more quickly than you intend to. No car can rewrite the rules of physics, but the iX takes a good crack at it. The big BMW resists body lean well and is remarkably agile for a car weighing close to 2.5 tonnes. In the end, though, even BMW’s crack engineers have been unable to completely disguise the iX’s size and heft. So, you can have fun on a twisty road, but don’t think the iX handles as well as the best sports cars . It will put its power to the road cleanly, as every model is four-wheel drive. That really helps make the most of the BMW’s performance in bad weather. And whichever model you pick, the iX will absolutely sprint between the corners. A bit more weight and feel from the steering and losing a few pounds would make the iX even more rewarding to drive. Space and practicality Space and practicality Lots of space for five in a cabin packed with tech, although the boot doesn’t quite have swallow-all capacity The iX is a controversial looking car, but whatever you think of the exterior it’s hard not to be impressed when you climb inside the cabin. That’s as it should be when you’re shelling out well over £70,000 but you can see where the money has gone when you settle in behind the wheel. Talking of wheels, the one doing the steering is hexagonal rather than round, which will get on your nerves as you shuffle the wheel through your hands. Otherwise there’s a lot to like. What really strikes you is the twin-screen cockpit. The two screens sit side by side to create what appears to be one huge display. Right in front of you is the 12.3-inch instrument panel. You can tinker with the display to change the information it shows you, and switching between the car’s different modes also changes the look of the screen. It’s easy to set the display to show the essentials – in a car this quick and quiet you’ll want to keep the speedo clearly in view. The driver and passenger sit up high, just as you’d expect in an SUV, with a good view forward. Depending on your height and how you position your seat you may find the rear-view mirror gets in your way a bit, but it’s not too much of an issue. Big rear pillars interrupt the view over your shoulder when reversing, but as every car comes with sensors and a rear-view camera, it’s not a dealbreaker. There’s a wide range of adjustment to the seat and wheel, so drivers of all sizes and builds should be able to find a comfy position. We’ve found the seats really comfortable and supportive on long drives. Storage is taken care of with big door bins, a reasonably useful glovebox, and a couple of handy cubbies. There’s a lot of room in the back as well as the front. Being an EV there’s no need for a transmission tunnel, so the iX doesn’t have one. Instead, there’s a flat floor to leave plenty of space for everyone’s feet, even travelling with three in the back. Legroom is more than generous, and there’s plenty of headroom too. Even in models with a panoramic sunroof there should be more than enough head space for six-foot passengers. The iX is a wide car, and that pays off in the back with enough breadth to the cabin for three grown-ups to sit comfortably. Hidden ISOFIX points can quickly be uncovered if you’re travelling with young children. USB-C ports in the rear of the front seats keep phones and tablets charged up. If there’s one let down in terms of the iX’s practicality, it’s the boot. In isolation, the BMW’s 500-litre capacity isn’t too bad, but other electric SUVs offer more room for your bags. At the lower end of the price scale the Kia EV9 beats all with 858 litres on offer if you fold away seats six and seven, which are themselves an added bonus over the BMW. The Polestar 4 has 526 litres of boot space. At the pricier end of the scale, the Mercedes EQE SUV's 520-litre boot is a bit underwhelming, but you get 650 litres in the Volvo EX90 and 688 litres in the Lotus Eletre. On the plus side, there’s no load lip in the BMW iX which makes it easy to slide heavy items in and out. With the back seats lowered you really do have plenty of space to fill – with 1,790 litres you'll need to buy half of IKEA before it becomes a problem – although it’s a shame there’s nowhere to store the luggage cover. There is some space under the floor, but it’s taken up by the charging cables. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories Stunning style, and high-tech infotainment, although the voice control can be a bit hit-and-miss To say the iX’s interior is modern is to undersell it. To our eyes it looks like the cabin of a car from another few years into the future. Traditional it is not. There’s a mixture of materials and finishes, but it all comes together to make a superb and harmonious whole – eyecatching, minimalist, and thoroughly luxurious. The standard of finish leaves a Tesla Model X far behind. As we’ve touched on before, your view is dominated by the twin-screen displays that curve elegantly across most of the dashboard. BMW calls this BMW Live Cockpit Plus. The screen in front of you takes care of driving essentials like the car’s speed and range, while the one to the left handles infotainment. The 14.9-inch screen looks fantastic, as crisp and clear as a high-end television. Start to delve through the menus and it can be a little intimidating at first, but it’s worth sticking with it as it’s not really as difficult to use as it first seems. You can prod at the screen and leave mucky marks or try the hit-and-miss voice controls, but we’d recommend you reach for the iDrive rotary controller. It’s much easier to use without becoming distracted while driving than poking at the touchscreen, hoping to hit the right icon without losing sight of the road ahead. If you prefer, you can wirelessly connect your smartphone instead. Both Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are supported. Plenty of modern cars have air con controls buried in touchscreen menus. BMW has sensibly kept the temperature controls on show all the time, although you do need to delve into a menu to adjust the fan speed. You can order your BMW with accessories including clip-in laptop trays and coat hangers, but we’ve found them fiddly to use and not designed with the same attention to detail or flair as the rest of the car. Meanwhile, the floor mats are made from a synthetic yarn that’s recycled from old fishing nets, and if you opt for a leather interior that upholstery is tanned using olive leaves. The wood is responsibly sourced, too. Electric range, charging and tax Electric range, charging and tax Every version of the BMW iX is fully electric, so there are no exhaust emissions. If you can recharge using energy from a renewable source, so much the better. While all electric cars have no exhaust emissions, it doesn’t follow that they are all equally efficient. Miles per kilowatt hour of electricity is the equivalent of miles per gallon for EVs. The xDrive40 achieves 3.0miles/kWh on the combined cycle. That’s respectable for a big electric SUV with such strong performance. The more powerful xDrive50 achieves 2.9 mi/kWh. So, the less powerful model will go further on a charge, right? Well, no, because BMW has given the xDrive40 a much smaller battery with a 74kWh capacity. The more powerful xDrive 50 gets 108kWh, and therefore a much longer range. It’s a shame the bigger battery isn’t available as an option with the base model, as the car’s range is quite modest. Officially it should cover up to 257 miles but reckon on closer to 200 miles in the middle of winter (EVs have a lower range in cold weather). How do the official figures stack up in the real world? Well, we tested the xDrive50 over mostly motorway miles and got 303 miles out of the battery, which is 82% of its claimed range of 369 miles. It was the only car in the test to achieve more than 80%, but its economy figure of 2.7mi/kWh was the worst – likely due to being very heavy and a boxy shape. For context, the Ford Mustang Mach-E achieved 3.3mi/kWh. Whichever iX model you pick will currently sit in the 2% benefit-in-kind tax bracket, making the big BMW something of a bargain for company car drivers. For private buyers, there’s no Vehicle Excise Duty to pay at all, thanks to being a zero-emission vehicle. Ultra-rapid charging is possible at 150kW or 200kW, depending on the model. Safety and security Safety and security The BMW iX earned a five-star rating from the safety experts at Euro NCAP when it was tested in 2021. It scored 91% for adult occupant protection, 87% for child occupants, 73% for pedestrians and 81% for its safety assist systems. Among the clever features contributing to those high scores are the airbag between the front seats, designed to reduce the risk of injury in a side-on collision. Others include a lane attention assistant, lane departure warning and speed limit recognition. Every iX comes with an autonomous emergency braking system that can detect pedestrians and cyclists as well as other cars. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems The iX is still a very new car, so it’s too early to make a definitive verdict on the BMW’s reliability. However, with fewer moving parts electric vehicles are generally more reliable than cars with an internal combustion engine. That still leaves plenty of high-tech systems and gadgetry which could go wrong. Again, it’s early to say, but BMW tends to finish midfield in owner satisfaction and reliability surveys.

https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/x6-m-competition,BMW X6 M Competition Review & Prices,"€168,293",8/10,new,"Is the BMW X6 M Competition a good car? Is the BMW X6 M Competition a good car? Choosing the BMW X6 M Competition over a regular X6 is like cracking a nut with a pneumatic drill instead of a sledgehammer. The cooking version is already quick, dramatic, and luxurious. The M Competition takes those qualities – in particular performance – and nudges the dial off the scale. Or to put it another way, the BMW X6 M Competition is the ultimate expression of a BMW SUV . For starters, its twin-turbocharged V8 petrol engine produces 625hp, plus it costs more than £110,000. It competes with quick sports SUV coupes such as the Audi RS Q8 , Mercedes-AMG GLE 63 Coupe and Porsche Cayenne Coupe . But, if you think performance cars should be as close to the ground as possible and have two seats, then the BMW X6 M Competition will be about as welcome as a Hawaiian shirt at a black-tie ball. You’ll also potentially be unenthusiastic about the way it looks. Let’s just say you can’t be the shy and retiring type to own one, with its gaping black grille, huge air intakes, huge wheels, large exhausts and vivid unique paint colours helping it stand out over the standard X6. And, if by some miracle you’d missed the exterior, the X6 M Competition’s interior is every bit as in-your-face. Think seriously figure-hugging seats with quilted stitching, aluminium trim, sports pedals and ambient lighting. Of course, there’s the chance to up the ante with BMW’s options list, but a superb fit and finish are standard. One thing that stays the same versus standard BMW X6 s is the infotainment system, although it’s one of the best in the business. It’s BMW’s top-end Professional system, which gets a 12.0-inch screen that can be controlled by touch, a rotary dial between the front seats or even a very good voice control system. It also gets Apple CarPlay as standard (with Android Auto to follow in time), although you’ll have to pay for it beyond year one and Mercedes’ digital dials are more visually impressive and configurable than the ones you get as standard in the BMW. Two adults in the front of the BMW X6 M Competition will have no issues with space, but if you regularly carry tall adults in the back you’ll be better off with the more upright X5 M. If, like the majority of people, you don’t, then it’ll be just fine. The boot will be too, although an RS Q8, GLE 63 Coupe and Cayenne Coupe all have a slightly larger one. Elsewhere the BMW X6 M Competition also comes as simply an X6 M with 600hp, but here in the UK it’s the full-fat 625hp Competition model or nothing. That V8 petrol sends this 2.4-tonne behemoth to 62mph from standstill in just 3.8 seconds. That’s supercar fast. And while it won’t lap a track as quickly as BMW’s fastest M cars, the X6 M Competition’s huge tyres, stiff, adaptive suspension, extra bracing and quicker steering all help it feel just about as agile as an SUV can, even without the rear-wheel steering of some alternatives. Of course, in town, this big SUV doesn’t feel quite so nimble, but on the motorway it’ll breeze down slip roads and overtake faster-moving traffic with a simple twitch of the right foot, all the while remaining more comfortable and quiet than it has any right to be given its sporty intentions. So, the first decision is whether or not a car like (and that looks like) the BMW X6 M Competition appeals to you, but if the answer is yes, then you’ll find few finer ways to go fast in an SUV . Make sure you head to our BMW deals page and used BMW page for the very best prices, and make sure you see how you can sell your car online through carwow , too. How much is the BMW X6 M Competition? How much is the BMW X6 M Competition? We’re into “if you have to ask you can’t afford it” territory here, and the price can climb further if you are tempted by all the optional packs and extras. Then again, the X6 M Competition is not out of kilter with the price of other high-performance SUVs. It’s more expensive than the Audi RS Q8, but not quite as pricey as the Mercedes-AMG GLE 63. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort Mind-blowing performance but lacks four-wheel steering Leaving the colossal price to one side for a moment, one of the few disadvantages to choosing he M Competition over a regular X6 is that it’s not available with four-wheel steering. Apparently, the huge rear wheels and tyres are simply too big. That means the M Competition model has a larger turning circle than more sober versions that steer from the back as well as the front. At a smidge under five metres, this is a big car, and the sloping roofline doesn’t make for great visibility when reversing. BMW’s Parking Assistant Pro is standard, which can park the car for you, so this isn’t as annoying as it might be. As you’d expect of a BMW with an ‘M’ badge, the suspension is firmer than the standard car’s. Riding on huge alloys (21 inches at the front and 22 inches at the back), you do feel potholes and other sharp-edged imperfections in the road surface. The suspension is adaptive, so the driver can choose a more comfortable setting, but even at its softest you are in no doubt that this is a performance SUV. It’s not a car that glides over pockmarked roads. Motorways give the X6 M Competition a chance to stretch its legs, although the UK limit is just a gentle jog for a car as quick as the BMW. The firmer suspension of the M Competition works much better on the motorway than it does around town. The car feels solid, taut, and in control. You won’t be stuck behind slower traffic for long, and the automatic gearbox is quick to drop down a gear or two when needed. There is some road noise generated by those super-sized tyres, but otherwise the M Competition’s cabin is quiet and comfortable at a motorway cruise. BMW’s engineers may not be able to rewrite the rules of physics, but they’ve given it a good go. The X6 M Competition is one of the most rewarding SUVs to drive on a country road. It’s heavy, very heavy, but thanks to sharp steering and minimal lean in corners the M Competition changes direction quickly. The four-wheel-drive system is tuned to send more power to the rear than the front to combine the traction of a 4x4 with the handling balance of a rear-wheel-drive car. With 625hp, the X6 M Competition rockets from one corner to another, and exceptionally powerful brakes slow the car down in time for the next bend. Space and practicality Space and practicality Lots of space up front, but the X5 M is more practical Coupe-SUVs like the X6 are curious things. You generally pay more than you would for a regular SUV, but objectively you end up with a less practical car. Not that you’ll notice in the front. There’s a wide range of adjustment to the seat and wheel, so tall or short, broad or thin, you should have no trouble getting comfortable. The seats have electrical adjustment, as you’d expect at this price point. They’re sculpted to hold the driver and front-seat passenger in place on a twisty road – we’ve found them really supportive and comfortable on B-road blasts and on long drives. There’s a memory function so more than one driver can save their favoured driving position and find it again at the push of a button. There’s a lot of storage space, with a large compartment under the central armrest and big door bins. You’ll also find a pair of cupholders and wireless charging for compatible mobile phones. The driver enjoys a good view out to the front, although as we’ve mentioned the view over your shoulder is hampered by the letter-box rear windscreen. The door mirrors are very large, though, which helps keep a close eye on whatever’s behind you. The sloping roofline does steal a bit of headroom in the back. Kids and shorter adults won’t mind, but taller adults will find their heads quite close to the ceiling. There’s plenty of legroom, though, so passengers shouldn’t feel too cramped. If you regularly carry adults in the back, an Audi Q8 is a little roomier. Or you could opt for the more practical BMW X5 M which offers similar performance and handling but with the practicality of a conventional SUV body. Air vents between the front seats keep the back of the car at a comfortable temperature. Better still, the climate control has four zones so passengers on either side of the rear bench can choose their own settings. In isolation, a boot capacity of 580 litres seems like a lot. You’ve certainly got room for a few holiday suitcases. It’s just that the likes of the Audi RS Q8 and Mercedes-AMG GLE 63 offer more. The sloping roof eats into the available space if you load above the level of the luggage cover, something that’s not a problem if you go for the BMW X5 M . Let’s not be too critical, though. The boot is very big, and the rear seats split in three parts so you can carry skis or other long loads and still have room for two passengers in the back. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories Brilliant infotainment, but not as dramatic as the inside of a Mercedes-AMG When a car costs well over £100,000, you have the right to expect exceptional fit and finish. BMW has consulted the luxury car play book and have run through it step by step to make a superb cabin. There’s a solidity to the materials and a precision to the fit, while the design is attractive and modern. Perhaps it doesn’t have the drama of the Mercedes-AMG, but it’s the cabin is crammed with quality and high-tech features. The head-up display might seem like a gimmick, but it really isn’t, allowing the driver to see key information like speed without taking their eyes from the road. It’s standard on the M Competition. There’s a twin-screen display, with the one in front of the driver taking the place of conventional dials and the infotainment screen in the middle of the dash. The driver display doesn’t match that in the Audi RS Q8 for the number of configurations, but it has a clean and smart design. The infotainment system isn’t the latest generation which you’ll find in more recent models like the all-electric BMW iX. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, though. The newest system looks fantastic, but it’s not quite as easy to use as that in the X6. You can prod the touchscreen or use the iDrive rotary controller on the centre console. It’s much easier to use the iDrive controller once on the move than prodding at on-screen icons. You’ll find the iDrive is far less distracting than the touchscreen. There’s also gesture control, which allows you to activate certain functions by waving your arms around in front of the screen. It takes a bit of time to learn the right gestures, though, which leaves most of us wondering if there’s any benefit. But some people have proven to love it, so maybe you will too. Voice control can also be used, so long as you can persuade the system to understand your accent. MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax BMW has fitted the X6 M Competition with a mild-hybrid system to take the strain from the engine and improve economy while reducing emissions. This is still a two-tonne-plus SUV with 625hp, though. Fitting mild-hybrid tech is like installing a solar panel at an oil refinery – it doesn’t make a lot of difference. The M Competition has the carbon footprint of a small country, with CO2 emissions of 288g/km and official combined fuel economy of 22.2mpg. Use the performance and you’ll be more likely to see economy in the teens. A sky-high first-year Vehicle Excise Duty bill is part of the on-the-road charges, and you’ll pay the £390 supplement for cars costing over £40,000 for five years from then on. If your employer is footing the bill, you’ll pay company car benefit-in-kind tax at the top rate of 37%. Safety and security Safety and security The safety experts at Euro NCAP have not tested the X6. They have tested the X5, which is largely the same car beneath its more conventional bodywork. The X5 scored five stars when it was last tested in 2018. It earned an 89% rating for adult occupant protection, 96% for child occupants, 75% for protecting vulnerable road users, and 75% for its safety assistance systems. M Competition cars come with a wide range of driver assistance tech as standard, including the radar-based Driving Assistant system to help keep a safe gap to the vehicle ahead. Autonomous emergency braking is standard fit. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems Don’t assume that a prestige badge is necessarily a guarantee of reliability. BMW tends to have a mixed record in reliability and customer satisfaction surveys, with some models performing better than others. Although the X6 is a bit of a niche product, the similar X5 sells in greater numbers and does feature in reliability studies. It performs pretty well, with a better score than many BMW models. So, you can buy an X6 reasonably confident that it shouldn't need anything more than routine servicing. The X6 comes with a three-year, unlimited-mileage warranty."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/2-series-gran-tourer,BMW 2 Series Gran Tourer Review and Prices,"€38,222",7/10,new,"The seven-seat BMW 2 Series Gran Tourer represented a step change for the brand when it was launched in 2015, something that’s blatantly obvious when you first clap eyes on its rather van-like form. It was updated in 2018, getting a new front-end design with LED fog lights, new interior design and upholstery options and more exterior colours. It’s what’s underneath the skin that represented the biggest about turn for the company, because the BMW 2 Series Gran Tourer is actually front-wheel drive. BMW’s ‘ultimate driving machine’ tagline? comes, in some part, thanks to its preference for producing rear-wheel-drive models. But, in a car like the Gran Tourer, powering the front wheels allows for a more spacious interior, which will be of greater relevance to most potential buyers. All-wheel drive models are available, too, if you need more grip in tricky conditions. Proof of the packaging advantages come in the form of a spare pair of smaller seats that fold into the boot. They mark the BMW 2 Series Gran Tourer out from the smaller Active Tourer – which is spacious itself, but only has room for five onboard. However, the space around the rearmost seats in the Gran Tourer isn’t what you’d call generous – they’re best off for children on a long journey as both access and knee room is tight. Just like in the smaller Active Tourer, though there’s space for two adults in the outer seats of the rear three-person bench, another in the middle pew and loads of room up front for two tall adults, too. Handily, the middle bench splits 40:20:40 as standard, and will slide back and forth in a 60:40 configuration allowing brilliant flexibility. Unfortunately, though, all-wheel drive models can’t have it. The driver sits quite high even in the seats lowest position, but this at least affords a brilliant view of the road ahead, while visibility in every other direction is good too. As you would expect, the 2 Series Gran Tourer leads the way when it comes to interior quality in a car of this type and size. Everything inside has BMW’s trademark solid build and most of the plastics look and feel expensive. However, remember you’ll pay a premium to drive the Gran Tourer (over rivals such as the Citroen C4 SpaceTourer and the VW Touran) with price starting at around £27,000 and rising beyond £36,000. And, despite a long list of standard equipment, you can expect some expensive options too. Of course, paying extra for the BMW also gets you one of the best infotainment systems on sale today: its iDrive system. OK, so you only get a relatively small 6.5-inch screen on all cars, but it is at least easy to move through its on screen menus via the rotary controller and menu shortcut buttons between the front seats. BMW’s Tech Pack is quite pricey, but brings a bigger screen, as well as a head-up display and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. If space is a priority, there are better MPVs, but nobody can deny that the 2 Series Gran Tourer makes carting a large family about more glamorous Thankfully, BMW hasn’t thrown everything it stands for to the wolves, the Gran Tourer is still good to drive for an MPV, thanks mostly to being based on the playful Mini hatchback. It shares that car’s grippy front end and direct steering, although there’s significantly more body roll to contend with when pushing it hard around tight bends. It rides comfortably, too, as long as you steer clear of the range’s large wheels and stiffer suspension settings. M Sport models, for instance, look great, but with their 18-inch alloy wheels and stiffer suspension set-up they tend to thud into potholes a little firmly for an MPV. You’re better off sticking the smallest wheels and standard more comfortable suspension set-up for the plushest ride quality. As you would expect from any BMW, the 2 Series Gran Tourer gets an excellent range of engines – the majority of which offer spritely performance along with affordable running costs. There are both three and four-cylinder options in both petrol and diesel forms, with power outputs ranging from 140-190hp. The 220d 2.0-litre diesel is bound to be a popular choice thanks to being able to shove itself from 0-62mph in 8.2 seconds and real-world fuel economy of more than 50mpg. Its substantial mid-range performance will also prove useful when the BMW’s packed to the rafters with people and stuff, and it remains quiet and smooth even when rushed. Don’t be put off the smaller 116d diesel or three-cylinder 118i petrol if you spend the majority of time in town, though. They’re cheaper to buy and run and will feel easily up to the job of town work when full to the brim with a family’s gubbins. So, MPV buyers who put quality and technology before outright space should certainly have the BMW 2 Series Gran Tourer on their shortlist. However, we suspect the majority of buyers put space first, and quite simply, there are better alternatives for carrying seven people in comfort, even if that means doing so in slightly less luxurious surroundings."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/3-series-touring,BMW 3 Series Touring Review & Prices,"€62,964",9/10,new,"Is the BMW 3 Series Touring a good car? Is the BMW 3 Series Touring a good car? If you’re in the market for a practical family car your first thought will probably be to go for an SUV of some kind, but you shouldn’t dismiss humble estate cars such as the BMW 3 Series Touring. You know what to expect with the 3 Series Touring: a spacious, practical car which is comfortable, beautifully made and great fun to drive on a twisty road. It’ll also be cheaper to run than an SUV thanks to its more modest size. It’s a handsome car as well. Sure it doesn’t have quite the same street-cred as a BMW X3 , but the angular nose, massive air intakes and real dual exhaust tips help it stand out against the Mercedes C-Class Estate and Audi A4 Avant , especially if you go for M Sport trim. The cabin is equally impressive. The low-slung seating position is more like a sports car than a roomy estate, and the way the dashboard wraps around you makes it feel even more special. Everything inside also feels plush and solidly built, and you get one of the best infotainment systems in the business. It’s a huge curved display – added for the late 2022 update to the 3-Series – spanning half the dashboard, incorporating a slick touchscreen and a digital driver’s display. So there’s plenty of tech on offer in the 3 Series Touring, and there’s plenty of space inside as well. Those up front will have loads of room to stretch out and taller passengers will be comfortable in the back. That said, the Volvo V60 offers slightly more rear legroom. Fitting a child seat in the rear is no bother as the doors open nice and wide, and there’s acres of room in the boot for all your family clobber. It’s not quite as big as the Skoda Superb Estate , but you’ll easily get a couple of bikes in with the seats folded down. Whatever you decide to put in the back won’t get bounced around either because the 3 Series Touring is nice and smooth over the bumps. The suspension deals with potholes really well whilst also keeping body lean through the bends to a minimum. Go for the M Sport trim level and you get lowered suspension and bigger wheels for an even sportier feeling, but if you do a lot of motorway miles you’ll be better off with the regular car as it’s slightly more comfortable. The 2.0-litre 320i petrol is the best all-round engine choice as it’s smooth and economical, although anyone doing mostly motorway miles could be better off with the fuel-sipping 2.0-litre diesel. Those looking to have the most fun will want the six-cylinder M340i petrol for its blistering pace, but it is pretty thirsty. Company car drivers are also catered for with the 330e plug-in hybrid . An update to the 3 Series range in late 2022 removes any manual gearbox options, with all models getting an eight-speed automatic as standard. Thankfully it’s one of the best ‘boxes around and it helps make heavy traffic far less stressful. The 3 Series’ mid-life facelift also sees some new, slimmer headlights and an altered grille, as well as some new paint schemes and different alloy wheel designs. There’s an abundance of driver assistance systems available to make long journeys much less tiring, but they do cost extra. On the whole the BMW 3 Series Touring is an excellent family car. It’s practical, comfortable and good fun to drive, but you do have to be prepared to hand over a bit of extra cash for some must-have options such as adaptive cruise control and lumbar support. Do this and you’ll have one of the best estate cars around. Keen on making a BMW 3 Series Touring your next car?

How much is the BMW 3 Series Touring How much is the BMW 3 Series Touring The BMW 3 Series Touring is slightly more expensive than the Audi A4 Avan t, but it undercuts the Mercedes C-Class Estate on price. While there are quite a few optional extras, you still get a decent amount of standard equipment. All cars get a 14.9-inch curved infotainment system with a 12.3-inch digital driver’s display, front and rear parking sensors, a reversing camera, heated seats and LED headlamps. M Sport is the pick of the range though, thanks to its more aggressive styling. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort The BMW 3 Series Touring is comfortable, great fun to drive and comes with a range of engines to suit all needs, but many of its advanced driver assistance features cost extra Wafting around town in the BMW 3 Series Touring is a stress-free experience. All-round visibility is good and you can jack the seat up enough to get a good view out. It’s easy to judge in tight spaces, however you still don’t get the same raised driving position as an SUV . The steering is nice and light in comfort mode, and the turning circle is decent as well. It’s not quite as manoeuvrable as the Volvo V60 , but that’s splitting hairs really. The standard-fit parking sensors and reversing camera also take the stress out of tight car parks. The suspension is exceptionally good at ironing out bumps in the road, making light work of speed humps and potholes. That said, M Sport cars with their bigger wheels and lowered ride height can get unsettled by particularly broken surfaces. The automatic gearbox is smooth in stop-start traffic, making rush hour a lot more relaxing, although it can be a touch slow to respond in comfort mode when you put your foot down at a busy junction. If you do a lot of short journeys in town, and have access to a charger at home, the 330e plug-in hybrid offers up to 37 miles of all electric range, so you can slink about in silence and save money on fuel. Most 3 Series Touring owners will likely spend a lot of time on the motorway, so it's a good job that it excels here. It’s comfortable, quiet and relaxing for eating up the miles. Wind noise is kept to a minimum with the exception of a small rustling from around the mirrors, and road noise is pretty minimal as well. Just keep in mind that it does get louder if you go for the larger wheels. This theme continues with comfort. It’s excellent, regardless of which wheels you have fitted, but smaller wheels will yield a slightly smoother ride thanks to the taller tyres. The difference is pretty minimal though, so if styling is important to you then by all means tick the M Sport box. If you rack up hefty mileage on the motorway, the 320d diesel is probably your best bet. It’s so refined you could be forgiven for thinking it was a petrol, and you should see over 50mpg without too much effort. Cruise control comes as standard, however you’ll have to pay extra if you want the adaptive system which automatically keeps you a safe distance from the car in front. A shame at this price point. It’s when the going gets twisty that the BMW 3 Series Touring really sets itself apart from other estate cars. It’s properly fun to drive, especially with the optional M Sport adaptive suspension. This allows you to firm up the dampers for a more sporty driving experience, but even without this option fitted the 3 Series handles itself really well in the bends. Body roll is kept to a minimum, and the rear-wheel-drive layout gives you a nice feeling of being pushed out a corner. You can get the all-wheel-drive xDrive system on all models, and it comes as standard on the high-performance M340i. This car also gets a 3.0-litre six-cylinder engine which, while thirsty, offers the most driving fun. Once you've finished acting like a hooligan, the Touring settles down and goes back to being a comfortable cruiser. It absorbs the bumps well and always feels secure and safe for when you just want to be whisked home. Space and practicality Space and practicality The BMW 3 Series Touring is as practical as you’d expect an estate car to be with a massive boot and loads of interior space, although some alternatives offer more rear legroom Drivers big and small will have no issues getting comfortable in the front of the BMW 3 Series Touring. There’s loads of space and almost endless adjustment in the seats and steering wheel for you to find your ideal driving position. Speaking of the seats, they’re nice and supportive, managing to hold you in place while also not being too tight. This makes long slogs up the motorway a relatively painless affair. While you’re sitting looking at tail lights on the M25 there are plenty of places in the 3 Series Touring for drinks and snacks to keep you energised, with a big cubby under the centre armrest and decent-sized door bins which can hold a big bottle of water. The glove box is also a reasonable size, and there’s a handy compartment in front of the gear selector with two useful cupholders and a wireless charging pad for your mobile phone (providing you have that option ticked). The back seats in the BMW 3 Series Touring are good enough for most people's needs. A Volvo V60 may offer a touch more knee room, however there’s not much in it. Headroom is also generous, even with the optional panoramic sunroof. Adults over six feet will have no issues getting comfortable. It’s pretty easy to fit a child seat as well. The rear doors open nice and wide, and the generous rear space means you can even get a bulky rear-facing seat in without having to move the front seat forward. That said, it’s even easier to fit a child seat in something like a BMW X3 thanks to its raised ride height, meaning you don’t have to bend down as far. Those in the rear also get big door bins, an armrest with some nifty cupholders and you can even opt to give them their own climate controls. There are a couple of USB charging ports thrown in for good measure, too. The 3 Series Touring has one of the biggest boots in its class at 500 litres. That’s around 45 litres more space than the Mercedes C-Class Estate and five more than an Audi A4 Avant . It is almost 20 litres smaller than the Volvo V60 ’s boot though, and the TARDIS-like Skoda Superb offers the most luggage space among this size of load-lugger at a whopping 660 litres. You also lose out on 90 litres of boot space if you go for the 330e plug-in hybrid model. This is thanks to the battery pack underneath the floor. The 3 Series Touring comes with an electrically opening tailgate as standard, and you can upgrade this to have a hands-free operation as part of the Comfort Pack, allowing you to sweep your foot under the bumper to gain access. The Comfort Pack also gets you electric folding rear seats from a button in the boot, as well as some satin anti-slip rails on the boot floor to make sliding heavy items to the front easier. You get 1,510 litres of space with the seats folded down. That’s 135 litres more than the Mercedes C-Class Estate and 15 litres more than the Audi A4 Avant, but some way off the 1,950 litres you get in the Skoda Superb. The seats fold completely flat, meaning no annoying ledges to push heavy items over. There’s some useful storage space under the boot floor as well, including somewhere to secure the load cover, and there are plenty of tie-down points, bag hooks and a 12-volt socket. If you’ve just got a couple of shopping bags to chuck into the boot, you can just open the rear window portion of the tailgate. That’s also really handy if you need to grab something out but you don't have enough space to open the whole bootlid. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories The 3 Series Touring has one of the most upmarket cabins in this class. It’s beautifully built and logically laid out, it’s just a shame that some desirable features cost extra You’ll struggle to find any cheap-feeling or flimsy materials in the BMW 3 Series Touring; it has one of the best-made cabins of any premium car. The Mercedes C-Class Estate runs it close, but it doesn’t quite match the quality feel of the BMW. Everything you touch and look at is plush and nicely padded, even the lower parts of the door bins are soft-touch. The overall design is nice as well, although a Mercedes C-Class Estate has a more interesting-looking dashboard. At least everything is logically laid out though, and all the buttons and switches have a nice, solid feel to them, and the ambient lighting does a good job of lifting the cabin even further. The stand-out feature in the 3 Series though is the infotainment system. As standard you get BMW’s latest iDrive system, comprising a 12.3-inch digital drivers display and a 14.9-inch touchscreen infotainment system in one curved piece of glass. It not only looks impressive, it’s packed with features. You get Apple CarPlay and Android Auto , although only for the first three years, then you have to pay for it, which is a shame on a car at this price point and a worrying development for drivers wanting their car to work without paying extra subscriptions. What’s also a shame is the fact you have to opt for the Technology Pack to get wireless phone charging, something which comes as standard on a lot of much less expensive cars. You can also have a 4G connection for live traffic updates, weather forecasts and Spotify streaming, and the system is user-friendly as well. You can either use it as a touchscreen, which is easier to use when you're stationary, or there’s a scroll wheel which is better when on the move. You can also use the “Hey BMW” voice commands which work reasonably well and respond to most regional dialects, and it’s a good job they work as well because the climate controls are buried in the screen. MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax The BMW 3 Series Touring is available with a wide range of engines including petrols, diesels and a plug-in hybrid. For most people, the 320i petrol is the best all-rounder. It may not be the most economical engine on offer, although our time with the car saw an average of 34 mpg, but it’s smooth, quiet and plenty quick enough. You can also have a 330i petrol if you’re looking for a bit more oomph, although this increase in power does knock the fuel economy down somewhat. If you’ve developed the need for speed, the six-cylinder M340i is your best bet. It’s pretty thirsty, but it sounds great and can do 0-60 mph in 4.6 seconds. Those who spend a lot of time hauling up and down the motorway will want the 320d diesel. It’s a punchy engine, it’s so refined you could be forgiven for mistaking it for a petrol, and it’ll return 55 mpg without too much effort. There’s also a six-cylinder diesel with 340hp, and it can do 0-60 mph in a similar time to the M430i petrol at 4.8 seconds, and it’ll still return up to 45 mpg. Company car drivers wanting the lowest tax rates will want the 330e plug-in hybrid. The low emissions and 37 miles of pure electric range give it a Benefit in Kind rate of 12%. Safety and security Safety and security The BMW 3 Series scored five stars in the 2019 Euro NCAP crash tests , so it’ll protect you pretty well should the worst happen. There’s also plenty of standard safety kit such as a plethora of airbags, electronic stability control, lane departure warning and front collision warning. You also get front and rear parking sensors as standard, as well as a reversing camera. You’ll have to pay extra though if you want a surround-view camera. While all models get remote central locking as standard, you’ll have to pay extra if you want keyless entry. You can also upgrade this to a digital key, meaning you can use your phone to lock, unlock and start the car. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems Overall, there are no reliability horror stories to report with the BMW 3 Series Touring, and owners have generally reported them to be solid, dependable cars. For added peace of mind all new BMW models come with a three year unlimited-mileage warranty, so any faults beyond wear and tear items will be taken care of. Not many brands offer unlimited mileage warranties, however three years is the bare minimum. Kia, for example, offers a seven-year warranty on all their cars. If you’re buying a used BMW 3 Series Touring, there are two recalls to be aware of. In August 2022, 319,399 cars were recalled for a potential exhaust gas recirculation cooler leak. There was also a recall at the same for another exhaust gas recirculation system fault, affecting 280,238 cars. If you don’t have paperwork showing that both of these recall jobs have been done, simply take your car to a BMW dealer and they’ll be taken care of free of charge."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/m8,BMW M8 Review & Prices,"€182,462",7/10,new,"Is the BMW M8 a good car? Is the BMW M8 a good car? If a BMW M4 is a small, nimble Velociraptor, then the BMW M8 is more like a T-Rex. It looks pretty similar from a distance, but up close it’s larger, visibly heftier and much more intimidating. It’s also significantly more powerful and – just like a Mercedes S63 Coupe – has a ravenous appetite. For petrol, that is. The standard BMW 8 Series is already one of the most intimidating cars on the road – short of a monstrous SUV – but the M8 gives it some even more aggressive visual upgrades. At the front, you get an even hungrier-looking mouth with some carbon-fibre fangs below the headlights, a menacing black grille and a speed-bump-scraping splitter. Unique M-alloy wheels stand guard at each corner and at the rear you’ll find a carbon-fibre spoiler, a new rear diffuser and a set of four real exhaust pipes. No horrible plastic fakery going on here. Step inside, and things feel genuinely special, too. There’s a new gear lever – instead of that divisive crystal knob in the standard 8 Series – a red starter button, loads of M-coloured stitching and some uber-supportive sports seats. There’s also plenty of carbon fibre dotted about the place and some special M8-specific dials on the digital driver’s display that gives you all sorts of info about the car’s new driving modes. The rest of the infotainment system doesn’t get any significant upgrades over the standard 8 Series’ unit, but it’s still dead easy to use and comes with a voice-activated personal assistant that’s so helpful Jeeves might want to start updating his CV. It’s a shame you still can’t get Android Auto , though. The back seats are also disappointedly cramped, but that’s no different to the standard 8 Series. If you fancy bringing a few friends along for the ride, there’s always the BMW M8 Gran Coupe with four doors, roomier back seats and a bigger boot to consider. Whichever of these cars you pick, you get the same 4.4-litre twin-turbocharged V8 petrol engine under the bonnet. This unit is related to the one in the M850i, but it’s been comprehensively re-worked by BMW’s nerdiest engineers so it produces a 600hp in standard trim and a whopping 625hp in range-topping M8 Competition guise. As in many new high-performance BMWs, power is sent to all four wheels through an automatic gearbox and a clever four-wheel-drive system that can alter how much power is sent to each wheel. How it does this depends on which of the M8’s many driving modes you choose – a spectrum ranging from tyre-destroying rear-wheel-drive setups to an uber-grippy four-wheel-drive mode that’ll blast you from 0-60mph in less than 3.2 seconds. Even if you ignore the BMW M8’s top-trumps-winning stats, you’ll find it’s a seriously impressive car to drive. The standard adaptive suspension and extra underbody bracing helps make it feel even more agile than an M850i, or even an M5, in tight corners, yet it’ll settle down into an impressively relaxing cruise at motorway speeds. The standard automatic gearbox is one of the best around, too – it’s smooth, responsive and doesn’t lurch at low speeds. One of the few thorns in the BMW M8’s side is that you have to pay extra for plenty of desirable driver-assistance systems – the sort that you get as standard on a Toyota Corolla … Trickier than deciding whether you want to pay for these upgrades, however, is deciding if the M8 is worth the extra cash over the standard 8 Series. Sure, if it’s the ultimate M car you want, it’s the car for you, but for anyone looking for a fast two-seater sports car that’ll lap up long journeys with ease might be better off with an M850i. Sound like your next car? Have a look at the latest deals for new BMW M8 s and both new BMW offers and used BMW stock, and see how much you could sell your car for on carwow. How much is the BMW M8? How much is the BMW M8? Well, it’s not cheap. I mean, were you expecting it to be? The M8 Competition (that’s the only version that’s available now) comes with a six-figure price tag as standard, although oddly the slightly roomier, four-door, M8 Gran Coupe is fractionally cheaper than the M8 two-door coupe, and certainly less expensive than the M8 convertible . Now, the thing is that the M8 isn’t quite as pricey as it first appears. If you want a Porsche with comparable performance, then you’re going to have to spend around £20,000 more on a 911 Turbo , and that doesn’t even have as much outright power as the M8. You could get a Mercedes E-Class Coupe 53 AMG for a lot less cash, but that only comes with a 435hp straight-six engine and is nothing like as ferocious as the M8. The closest Mercedes rival to the M8 is probably the Mercedes-AMG GT four-door with the 63 V8 engine with 639hp, which, like the 911 Turbo, costs around £20,000 more. So, the M8 is a… bargain? Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort Towering performance and precision handling mark the M8 out, but it is very heavy and can actually feel intimidating when you’re away from the race track The M8 isn’t going to be your automatic choice for urban transport, but you’re going to have to drive it into town eventually… There is actually an ‘Efficient’ engine mode for the mighty V8, but who on Earth is ever going to activate that in an M-car? Needless to say, even with the adaptive shock-absorbers set to ‘Comfort’ mode, the M8 is stiffer and firmer around town than the M850i, but it’s neither a back-breaker nor a deal-breaker. You could easily live with driving an M8 around town, every day, no problem. Of course, it’s a big car and you sit low-down in it, so tight manoeuvres need a bit of care, and those massive, and expensive, alloy wheels are just waiting to be dragged against a high kerb in a car park. The surround-view cameras help, as the low roof and broad pillars mean the view out isn’t fabulous, and the automated parking system is great for keeping those wheels away from a kerb. Turning circle? You might as well be driving an oil-tanker… Keep everything dialled down to Comfort, and the M8 is actually a really comfortable big-road cruiser (that goes double for the convertible version on a sunny day…). Of course, if you suddenly need to get a move on — such as merging with fast moving traffic — then even in Comfort mode the M8 leaps forward with proper venom. There’s a good bit of road noise kicked up by those big tyres on rough surfaces, but overall it’s a very refined thing, and the cocooning effect of that low slung cabin and those big seats makes you feel really comfy and cared for on a long run. Needless to say, you get a full suite of driving aids, including radar-guided cruise control and lane-keeping steering, but surely the point of owning an M8 is to drive it yourself. It’s not so much a twisty road you need for the M8 as a proper race track — once you’ve pushed the little, red ‘M2’ pre-set button to turn all the electronic controls up to maximum attack mode, the M8 becomes a truly ferocious weapon of a car. You can adjust the computer-controlled four-wheel drive system to a 4WD Sport setting, which sends more power to the rear wheels. That can be fun if you want to skid and drift about a bit, but leaving it in the regular four-wheel drive setting means you’ll be faster. The M8 is astonishingly fast in a straight line, as you’d expect, but it’s a big, hefty car so you need to get your braking done in that same straight line if you’ve got a tight corner in front of you. Slow-in, fast-out is the M8’s preferred driving mode, but helpfully carbon-ceramic brakes are available as an option. Mind you, the brakes are excellent, and once you learn how to keep the two-tonne weight under control, you find that the M8 stays utterly flat in corners, and grips with exceptional tenacity. The downside is that the extra power and weight mean that the M8 doesn’t feel as playful nor as engaging as the smaller M4 coupe, never mind the smaller and funner BMW M2 . But it’s still a hugely impressive thing, and feels a little sharper than the M5 saloon with which it shares its engine and chassis — the lower centre of gravity helps, as does the stiffer body structure. You can feel the effect, too, of the clever M-Differential, which sends power to and between the back wheels, and which gives you more control than the standard version on the M850i. On public roads, the M8 actually feels faster than it does on track, and you notice the weight less because you’re going slower (and legally…). In fact, that aggressive power delivery from the V8 can actually be a bit too much for road driving. Maybe we should have put it into Efficiency mode after all? Whatever, it’s a far sharper and more complete performance package than the M850i, but you can still argue a case that the M850i is a better all-rounder for a lot less money. Space and practicality Space and practicality Practical? Well for two people who don’t need much luggage, the Coupe is fine. The M8 Gran Coupe gives you some useful extra space in the back, but the boot is never quite useful enough on either version The M8 is perfectly practical if you’re sitting up front and only trying to carry two people. You’ll find that there’s plenty of storage space in the cubby under the armrest, and BMW is still one of the few car makers that puts cupholders in front of the gear selector, so you’re not constantly knocking your drink with your elbow when you go looking for reverse. There’s also a useful storage area at the bottom of the dashboard, which includes a wireless phone charger, and that gets a gorgeous, damped carbon-fibre lid. The door bins are a touch shallow, but have a big cutout to hold a water bottle. The glovebox is small enough to be pointless. Speaking of pointless, there’s the M8’s back seats. Well, the M8 Coupe’s back seats, which are just about roomy enough for a real person to squeeze into, but the headroom and legroom are spectacularly tight, so you wouldn’t want to be back there for very long. There’s no middle rear seat at all. If it’s space you need, you could upgrade (actually downgrade, as it’s fractionally cheaper than the M8 Coupe) to the four-door M8 Gran Coupe, which gets a longer wheelbase, back doors, and seats in the back you can actually use. The M8 Coupe has a boot volume of 420 litres, which isn’t too bad, but the boot opening is quite shallow, and so too is the boot itself. It is quite long and wide, but that does rather limit the amount of stuff you’re going to be able to load into it. Again, the M8 Gran Coupe does better — well, a little better. It gets 440 litres, and you can fold down the back seats, but you’re still stuck with the narrow boot opening, so it’s large, flat items only, please. It’s certainly not as practical as an Audi RS7 Sportback , which can offer 535 litres of boot space and a user-friendly hatchback opening. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories Gorgeous cabin with a top-notch infotainment system, but it’s a shame some items are still cost options The M8’s cabin is really gorgeous, but you might miss the crystal-topped gear selector from the lesser M850i. The M8 gets a leather-topped version with inset switches for selecting P and for setting the speed and ferocity of the gear change. Yes, you can do that, and you can also use the M-Dynamic menu system to set up everything else — from the suspension stiffness to the throttle response to even the braking performance — and save your pre-sets to the little M1 and M2 buttons on the steering wheel. These allow you to quickly switch from a comfy in-town mode to a sporty open-road mode without diving into touchscreen menus. That touchscreen also uses the iDrive clickwheel controller down on the console, or you can use steering wheel buttons, voice commands, or even ‘gesture control’ which means waggling your hand around in front of the screen to turn the volume up or down. Daft, really. The system itself is really good, though — arguably it’s a better infotainment setup than the newer ‘big screen’ version you get in the BMW 7 Series and its all-electric BMW i7 saloon sibling. Equally, the big digital driver’s instrument screen — which comes with some M-specific displays — is easier on the eyes than the latest version, and the head-up display — which projects speed and other info onto the windscreen — is excellent. Overall quality is fantastic, even if you can find a lot of the same buttons and switches in much, much more affordable BMW models. The M8 does at least get a unique red engine starter button. It also gets wonderfully comfortable two-tone leather seats, and a soft Alcantara-suede headlining that you’ll want to stroke for hours. You also get nice contrast stitching for the seats and door panels, in BMW M’s traditional red, blue, and purple colours. You get lashings and lashings of carbon-fibre trim too, and M8 badges on the seat headrests, which even light up at night. MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax Being as the M8 has a 625hp V8 twin-turbo engine, you’re not going to be expecting the best fuel economy ever. And you’re not going to get it — officially, the M8 does 25mpg, but if you’re any way enthusiastic with that throttle pedal, that’s going to head quickly south to around 18mpg. If you’re taking your M8 on a trackday, don’t expect to see anything better than 10mpg… The M8 has CO2 emissions of 265g/km, so you’ll pay the maximum Vehicle Excise Duty in the first year, plus the additional levy in years two-to-six for cars costing more than £40,000 (way more, in this case…). If you get the M8 as a company car, you’re going to be paying a lot of BIK tax. Safety & security Safety & security The 8 Series hasn’t been put through the independent Euro NCAP crash tests , but the 8 Series is closely mechanically related to the 5 Series, and that got a full five-star score with a 91 per cent adult occupant rating. It gets an 85 per cent child rating too, and the M8 does indeed have ISOFIX points in the rear and the front passenger seats. The mighty V8 should bring the vomit up a treat on the run to the creche… Annoyingly, BMW makes you pay extra for some useful safety and driver aids. There’s a £5,250 ‘Technology’ pack which gives you a loud Bowers & Wilkins stereo, but which also includes the Driving Assistant Professional pack. Buying this is the only way to get radar-guided cruise control (standard on a Toyota Corolla, let’s remind you…) centre-steer lane keeping, and upgraded collision warning, rear cross traffic, and blind spot warning systems. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems BMW has a reputation for quality and reliability, but the turbo V8 engine in the M8 needs careful attention and servicing. These engines have a tendency to burn through a lot of oil as they age, so you need to make sure that the oil is checked and topped-up regularly, and that only the highest-grade oil is used. Other than that, if you’re using the performance of the car, the brakes, tyres, and suspension are all going to take a battering, so be prepared for big bills as the car gets older. BMW sells all of its cars with a standard three-year, unlimited mileage warranty and you can optionally extend that out further for an extra payment. Just remember that the warranty doesn’t cover trackdays, so if you blow the gearbox on a race track, you’re going to have to pay for it yourself…"
https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/2-series-active-tourer,BMW 2 Series Active Tourer Review & Prices,"€49,798",7/10,new,"Is the BMW 2 Series Active Tourer a good car? Is the BMW 2 Series Active Tourer a good car? Crossovers and SUVs dominate the family car market these days, however BMW is keen to prove that the humble MPV is still deserving of a place on the driveway with the 2 Series Active Tourer. You can think of the 2 Series Active Tourer as a more sensible alternative to cars like the Audi Q2 and Mercedes GLA , and BMW’s own X1 . If those cars were a pair of trendy Nike Air Max trainers, the 2 Series Active Tourer is a sensible pair of Hush Puppies. In terms of premium people carriers, only Mercedes offers something similar, with the B-Class very much in the same mould as the Active Tourer - practical rather than fashionable for the size. It may not be as stylish as a modern SUV, but you can lift the 2 Series Active Tourer by going for the M Sport pack. This gives the car some sporty-looking bumpers, as well as 18-inch alloy wheels, making it look a bit less dowdy and a bit more aggressive. This may not hide the car’s boxy shape, but the plus side is a practical cabin. Up-front there’s plenty of headroom, as well as loads of adjustment in the seats to find your ideal driving position. You get plenty of storage, with a small cubby under the armrest as well as a big space under the centre console where you could keep a bag. The glovebox is an average size, as are the door bins. You can get a wireless charging pad in front of the cupholders, which has a helpful clip to keep your phone in place. The spacious theme continues in the rear. Headroom is still generous, and there’s plenty of knee room as well. There’s also a handy armrest with cupholders in the rear, and fitting a child seat is easy thanks to the exposed ISOFIX anchor points. As for the boot, you get 470 litres of space in the 218d models, or 415 litres in the 220i and 223i versions. Plug-in hybrid versions drop to 406 litres of cargo room thanks to a battery pack under the floor, although that’s still around the same as the 405 litres offered by the Audi Q2 . The Mercedes B-Class gets 420 litres of boot space, so slightly more than the petrol and plug-in hybrid Active Tourer, but less than you get in the 218d version. It’s worth bearing in mind however that the diesel’s additional storage space is situated under the boot floor., rather than within the main luggage area The exterior design may not be as exciting as an SUV, however the interior can easily match something like a Mercedes GLA . Everything feels really well screwed together, and the materials used are all high-quality. The overall cabin layout is very similar to the BMW X1 SUV, meaning you get the same floating armrest and wide central air vent, as well as the same 10.25-inch digital driver’s display and 10.7-inch infotainment system. Engine-wise, there are plenty to choose from. Only one of them is diesel though, the 218d with 150hp. Then there’s a couple of petrol models, the 220i and the 223i with 170hp and 218hp respectively. If you’re a company car driver, you’ll probably be looking at the tax-efficient 225e plug-in hybrid. This gets a 1.5-litre petrol engine paired with an electric motor, producing 245hp and capable of an official 56 miles on electric power alone. The plug-in hybrid makes the most sense around town, where the instant acceleration of the electric motor makes pulling out at busy junctions easy. Whichever engine you go for though, the 2 Series Active Tourer is easy to drive in the urban jungle. The BMW 2 Series Active Tourer may not be the most exciting offering in the family car segment, however if you’re looking for a well-made, premium-feeling car to haul the family around, and you’re not too bothered about looking flash while doing it, this car is certainly worth a look-in. If you’re looking to make the BMW 2 Series Active Tourer your next car, check out the latest offers available on carwow. Alternatively, you can browse used BMW models , and you can sell your car for what it’s really worth. How much is the BMW 2 Series Active Tourer? How much is the BMW 2 Series Active Tourer? The BMW 2 Series Active Tourer undercuts the Mercedes B-Class by some considerable margin. It’s also less expensive than the Volvo XC40 , however it’s a fair bit more pricey than the Audi Q2 . It’s also worth keeping in mind that the BMW X1 SUV isn’t that much more expensive than the 2 Series Active Tourer, and you get a more stylish exterior as well as more interior space. Still, the 2 Series Active Tourer is still reasonably well-equipped as standard. All cars get 17-inch alloy wheels, LED front and rear lights, a power-operated tailgate, a 10.7-inch infotainment system, a reversing camera and cruise control. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort The BMW 2 Series Active Tourer is easy to drive day-to-day thanks to great visibility and a decent turning circle, however it can be a bit hard over bumps in the road For nipping around town the BMW 2 Series Active Tourer is very good. It may not have the commanding driving position of an SUV, but you get excellent forward visibility, large door mirrors for a good view behind you and blind spots kept to a minimum, aside from a small one over your shoulders. The steering is also nice and light in comfort mode, and the turning circle is pretty tight as well. The standard-fit parking sensors and reversing camera make tight car parks much less stressful as well. There are no manual gearbox options for the 2 Series Active Tourer, your only option is an eight-speed automatic. Thankfully, it's an excellent gearbox which is smooth and responsive making traffic jams and busy junctions a breeze. If you spend most of your time in town, and have easy access to a charging point at home, it’s well worth considering the 225e plug-in hybrid. It can do almost 60 miles on electric power alone, and it’s nice to waft around the city in silent EV mode. The petrol engines are both smooth and punchy, with the 220i offering the best blend of performance and efficiency. Those chasing the best fuel economy may be tempted by the diesel. While it’s refined enough and economical, it’s only really worth considering for those doing a lot of motorway miles. You may find the 2 Series Active Tourer a bit firm if your local area is particularly potholed. This is made even worse if you go for the larger alloy wheels on M Sport models. It’s fine most of the time, however larger bumps can send a shock through the cabin and broken surfaces can upset things even further. An Audi Q2 is better in this respect. The 2 Series Active Tourer does well when you venture out onto the motorway. On the whole it feels secure and the steering weights up to help make the car feel more planted. You do get a bit of wind noise from around the mirrors but it’s not bad at all, and there’s barely any road noise to speak of. The suspension settles down at higher speeds as well, although it can still be harsh over rough surfaces and undulations. Overall comfort is good though, and the seats are also nice and supportive, meaning backache is kept at bay. If you spend a lot of time on the motorway, it may be worth paying extra for the Driving Assistant Plus package. This includes adaptive cruise control which can automatically keep you a safe distance from the car in front, as well as steer to keep you in lane. You’ll be pleasantly surprised by how well the BMW 2 Series Active Tourer handles a country road. It’s by no means a hot hatch, however for a practical MPV it’s actually quite good fun to drive. There’s plenty of grip, especially if you go for one of the plug-in hybrid options with all-wheel-drive, and that slightly stiff suspension means there’s not much body roll either. It’s just a shame that the steering is a bit numb. If you just want to get home in comfort, the 2 Series Active Tourer can do that as well. Once again it’s a bit firm over bumps, but on the whole it’s planted, relaxing and it inspires confidence through the bends. Space and practicality Space and practicality The 2 Series Active Tourer offers plenty of rear seat space and interior storage, however the boot is a bit smaller than you’d expect from an MPV There’s no shortage of space up front in the 2 Series Active Tourer, and it's easy to get settled. You get loads of adjustment in the seats and steering wheel, so finding your ideal driving position is simple, and the boxy shape means that headroom is generous as well. The seats are really comfortable, managing to be both grippy and supportive. The extendable thigh support is a welcome addition for those with longer legs. Interior storage is decent. You get good-sized door bins with a bottle holder and an average glovebox, as well as two handy cupholders in front of the centre console which can fit a wide variety of drinks. You also get a big tray under the armrest and covered storage inside it. The wireless charging pad has a handy clip to keep your phone in place, and it’s positioned in such a way that your phone is easily accessible. It’s in the back seats where you see the biggest benefit of the boxy shape. There’s loads of headroom, plenty of legroom and enough space for everyone's feet as well. Opting for the panoramic glass sunroof makes it feel even more light and airy. The seats can all slide backwards and forwards individually for either added legroom or more boot space depending on requirements, and the backrests can be reclined as well, in case your passengers want to take a nap. Fitting a child seat is easy, thanks to the wide opening rear doors and easy-access ISOFIX anchor points. It’s not quite as easy as in something like a BMW X1 though; that car is higher off the ground meaning less bending down to work the seat in. There’s even a decent amount of storage in the rear. The door bins will fit a big bottle, there’s a couple of handy cupholders in the armrest and there are two USB charging ports with a tray for your phone lower down. The boot in the 2 Series Active Tourer isn’t perhaps as big as you’d expect in a car such as this, although the actual size depends on which model you go for. The 218d has the most space at 470 litres, the 220i and 223i petrol have 415 litres and the plug-in hybrids, with their batteries under the floor, have 406 litres. That makes it more practical than a Volkswagen Golf, which has 381 litres of luggage space. However, the Mercedes GLA has 435 litres of space in non-plug-in hybrid models and a Skoda Karoq has 521 litres of cargo room. The BMW does have a similar amount of room to the Mercedes B-Class, with that car getting 420 litres of cargo space. The 2 Series Active Tourer is easier to pack full of stuff than an SUV thanks to a low load lip and a wide, square boot opening. The rear seats also fold completely flat to give you 1,455 litres of space in the 218d, 1,405 litres in the 220i and 223i and 1,370 litres in the plug-in hybrid. The Mercedes B-Class offers a roomier 1,505 litres of space with the rear seats folded though. There are also plenty of handy shopping bag hooks, tethering points and some underfloor storage in the boot, as well as a 12-volt socket which can be useful for plugging in a hoover or even a cool box on a camping trip. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories The BMW 2 Series Active Tourer has a quality-feeling interior which can easily match that of a posh SUV, but it’s not the most exciting cabin on the market The BMW 2 Series Active Tourer has a really well-made cabin which can easily compare to cars like the Audi Q2. In fact it looks very similar to the BMW X1, meaning you get loads of plush materials and the switchgear feels solid. It’s not the most exciting-looking cabin in this class, an award that goes to the Mercedes B-Class, but there are loads of options to personalise your car, and the overall design is modern with plenty of shiny metallic trims to liven things up. There aren’t many physical buttons to be found. There’s a volume wheel on the centre console and some controls for your driving modes, but that’s about your lot. The climate controls are all buried in the touchscreen, which can make them a pain to use on the move. You can use voice commands to get around this, and they do a pretty good job recognising most phrases such as “Hey BMW, I’m cold”. As for the infotainment system itself, it’s easy to use and it looks impressive as well. You get a 10.25-inch digital driver’s display and a 10.7-inch touchscreen in one single curved piece of glass. The graphics are crisp, however it can look a bit confusing at first glance. It’s highly customisable though, a bit like your phone, so it’s easy to navigate once you’ve got used to it. The digital drivers display is ok, however it’s not as good as the one you get in an Audi Q2. It shows plenty of information but it’s not all that customisable, and the screen is on the dark side. As part of the BMW Connected Drive feature you get live traffic updates and other online services, and it comes as standard for the first three years before needing renewing. You also get Apple CarPlay and Android Auto in case you don’t like BMW’s system, and it connects wirelessly. MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax There’s a wide range of engine options available on the 2 Series Active Tourer, so you should be able to find one to suit your needs. The entry-level engine is a 2.0-litre diesel with 150hp. This will return almost 60mpg according to official figures, and will accelerate from 0-60mph in 8.8 seconds. Then there are two petrol engines, starting with the 1.5-litre unit in the 220i. This is the best all-rounder. It has plenty of poke, with its 170hp of power allowing it to accelerate from 0-60 in 8.1 seconds, while offering an official 48mpg. If you want a bit more performance without going down the plug-in hybrid route, the 223i gets a 2.0-litre petrol engine with 218hp and near hot-hatch levels of acceleration, going from 0-60mph in 7.0 seconds. Fuel economy doesn’t take too much of a hit either at 47mpg. Company car drivers chasing the best BIK rates will want the plug-in hybrid for its low emissions. The 225e gets a 1.5-litre engine, paired with an electric motor to produce 245hp. This model can also go for up to 56 miles on electric power alone. Finally, there’s the 230e plug-in hybrid. This uses the same 1.5-litre engine and motor setup as the 225e, only now it produces a bonkers 326hp. It has an official figure of up to 57 miles on electric power alone, slightly more than the 225e. It’s worth noting that this engine is not available on the base-level Sport models. Safety and security Safety and security The BMW 2 Series Active Tourer scored the maximum five stars in its 2022 Euro NCAP safety tests, meaning the crash structure is good at keeping you and your occupants safe should the worst happen. All models also get lane departure warning and autonomous emergency braking to try and prevent you from having an accident in the first place. You can also get things like rear cross-traffic alert and an autonomous parking aid to help mitigate those low-speed impacts as optional extras. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems All new BMW models come with a three-year warranty as standard. This gives you peace of mind that if something does go wrong, aside from wear and tear items like tyres, the car will be fixed by your local BMW dealer with no charge. Three years isn’t as generous as some manufacturers though. For example, Toyota offers a five-year warranty and Kia offers seven years of cover. There are no reliability woes to report with the 2 Series Active Tourer as yet, so you can rest assured that it should be a solid and reliable car. There have been two recalls for the 2 Series Active Tourer that you should be aware of when buying one second hand. They both relate to a software issue meaning the airbag warning light won’t display if there’s a fault. In total, 7,336 cars are affected by this recall. If you’re buying a 2 Series Active Tourer second hand, make sure to ask for evidence that this recall has been addressed. If it hasn’t, it’s just a case of taking the car to your local BMW dealer and it will be fixed free of charge."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/x2,BMW X2 Review & Prices,"€57,927",7/10,new,"Is the BMW X2 a good car? Is the BMW X2 a good car? The BMW X2 marks a dramatic departure from the previous model. The old X2 looks relatively plain and almost hatchback -like, but this new X2 gets sharper styling with a fastback rear and chunky sides, plus a big grille which optionally lights up at night. It won’t be to everyone’s taste, but it’s certainly more striking. Underneath, it’s using the same mechanical bits and pieces as the taller, more practical X1 , so swapping to an X2 is a bit like kicking off your wedges and strapping on some stilettos — you can walk in both, but one is much more stylish than the other. There are several other sharply-styled SUVs you could consider, too. There’s the Audi Q3 Sportback , the Volvo EC40 , the Lexus LBX , and the incoming Renault Rafale . The X2’s cabin is, of course, largely shared with the X1 and that means you get the impressive-looking curved screens atop the dashboard, which includes a big central infotainment screen and a digital instrument panel. A head-up display is also optional. For the most part, the cabin looks and feels quality, but there are some unpleasantly cheaper materials if you go looking. You do have to get used to operating almost everything through the touchscreen - including the climate controls and even some of the headlight controls, which is really annoying. But that’s a criticism that can be laid at the door of many of the X2’s alternatives. Surprisingly, the X2 doesn’t compromise its practicality too much compared to the X1. Yes, the sloping roof does mean that you can’t pack in big boxes like you can in the X1, but the actual boot volume below the luggage cover is slightly better. Space in the back seats is also fine, although you will notice that there’s less headroom and less light coming in than in the X1. You can choose from two petrol-engined options for the X2. There’s an entry level X2 20i, which uses a 2.0-litre turbo four-cylinder engine driving the front wheels through a seven-speed automatic gearbox. There’s also the X2 M35i, which also gets a four-cylinder turbo 2.0-litre engine, but which is amped-up to 300hp and has four-wheel drive and lower, firmer suspension. There’s also the all-electric BMW iX2, with a choice of two power outputs - we’ve reviewed this separately here . If you’re interested in finding out more, you can check out the latest BMW X2 deals on Carwow. You can also find used X2 models, or search for other used BMWs from our network of trusted dealers. And I can also sell your car online through Carwow. How much is the BMW X2? How much is the BMW X2? The X2 kicks off at just over £40,000 for an SDrive20i in M Sport trim. That’s only about £1,000 more than the equivalent X1, though that car does have two additional, cheaper trim levels to choose from, bringing its entry price down. You can have an X1 for around £5,000 less than an X2. With the Mercedes GLA , Audi Q3 Sportback and Volvo XC40 all starting closer to £35,000 the X2 does look a little expensive. Just bear in mind that the M Sport trim is a closer equivalent to Audi’s S Line or Mercedes’ AMG Line, so that price gap isn’t quite so drastic. And the M35i version of the X2 is cheaper than a Mercedes-AMG GLA 35 . The cheapest X2 you can buy still comes with 19-inch alloy wheels, Alcantara upholstery, adaptive suspension, full LED lights, and a suite of driver assistance tech. The M35i model gets additional driving modes plus a sporting makeover, with 20-inch wheels, an M-specific bodykit, and sports seats. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort Good performance and easy to drive, but M35i isn’t as much fun as you might hope Driving the X2 in town is pretty easy. We’ve only driven the sporty M35i so far, but slip it into its comfort or eco driving mode and the engine and gearbox become unobtrusive and don’t feel jerky or uncomfortable in typical sluggish town traffic. Visibility is good out of the front, but rear visibility is very compromised - there’s a big blindspot over your shoulder, and the rear window is narrow. It’s a good thing BMW’s clever parking tech comes as standard - it’s capable of parking the car for you, while the steering has a memory function that allows you to retrace your steps automatically, which is great if you meet another car coming towards you on a narrow road and have to reverse. The M35i in particular has quite a firm suspension setup, and this does feel rather compromised in town where you really notice speed bumps or poor road surfaces. But the same criticism can be said of the M35i’s sporty competitors from Mercedes or Audi - we’ll try the regular 20i model soon to see if it’s more forgiving. Performance from the M35i’s engine is ample, as you might expect. There’s loads of power in reserve if you want to get up to speed on a short sliproad, or to make decisive overtaking easy. The slinky silhouette of the X2 also means that wind noise is reduced, making for quite good refinement - though the M35i’s wide tyres and shouty exhaust do spoil the serenity a little bit. Again, once we’ve tested the 20i model we’ll update this review with our thoughts. Standard cruise control is included, but if you’d like adaptive cruise control it’s available as part of a driving assistance pack. This also includes active lane-keeping aids and speed limit warnings, which annoyingly switch back on every time you start the car, and there’s a torturous on-screen sequence to work through to turn them off. The X2, like the X1 on which it’s based, is pretty good fun to fling down a twisting road. The steering is nicely weighted and accurate, with more feedback about what the front wheels are doing than you get in most small SUVs. The M35i’s 300hp makes it a tenacious performer, and the eight-speed gearbox can go between slushing changes together nicely or rifle-quick manual shifts in an instant. There’s also some exhaust popping and banging in Sport mode, which is either annoying or entertaining depending on your taste. However, the M35i doesn’t have the sense of playfulness that you’d hope for in a hot SUV of this size. A Mini Countryman feels more fun, and an Audi RS Q3 has bags of character emanating from its five-cylinder engine. The BMW is better in the bends than the Audi, though, as well as the Mercedes-AMG GLA 35, so it’s not all bad news - but you’d have more fun driving the BMW M135i or a similar hot hatchback. The M35i will go from 0-62mph in 5.4 seconds, which is pretty quick - but in the days of electric cars , you can get something that will go much quicker for much less money. The MG 4 XPower , for example, manages it in just 3.8 seconds. Space and practicality Space and practicality A decent boot and reasonable space in the back seats, but the sloping roof limits overall roominess The X2’s front seats are sporty and sculpted, and keep you in place pretty effectively during hard cornering. They’re very adjustable, too - not only do you get the usual fore/aft, backrest and height adjustment, but there’s an extendable seat base to better support people with longer legs. There’s plenty of movement in the steering wheel too, so drivers of all sizes should be able to get pretty comfortable. Storage up front is average, with decent-sized door bins, a glovebox, two cupholders and a space under the central armrest. Ahead of the cupholders, there’s a wireless charging pad with a retaining bar to keep your phone in place, which is useful, but what’s lacking is a sort of catch cubby for keys, wallets or other pocket contents. There’s an open storage tray under the armrest, but it’s difficult to access if you’re actually sitting in the seat while the lid on the armrest is — irritatingly — hinged the wrong way for right-hand drive. Despite the X2’s sporty shape there’s a surprising amount of space in the back seats. Legroom for adults is good, and there’s room for a six-foot adult to sit behind a driver of a similar size. Headroom is a little more compromised. It’s still good, but taller passengers will find their heads brushing the roof. The centre passenger is much worse off, too - while there’s not too large a hump in the floor and the centre seat is wide enough, there’s a curious lump in the roof that severely limits space for anyone sitting in the middle. Those travelling with three in the rear would be much better served by the more conventionally-shaped X1. Loading child seats is a bit more awkward than it would be in the X1 too, thanks to the lower roofline and smaller rear doors. You get ISOFIX child seat mounts in both outer rear seats, behind removable plastic covers. Boot space depends on which model you go for - the M35i has a 560-litre boot, but on the 20i this is reduced to 515 litres thanks to the presence of a mild hybrid system under the floor. That’s about on par with the Audi Q3 Sportback, which has 530 litres, and easily beats the 395-litre Mercedes GLA. The space lost in the mild hybrid model is entirely under the floor, so the regular boot space is unaffected. There is a nice square floor, and there’s room behind the wheel arches to keep smaller items. A 12V socket sits to one side. Lift the boot floor and, on M35i models, there’s quite a bit of extra storage - and you can lock the boot floor against the rear seats to make proper use of the additional height on offer. Useful, as the X2’s sloping rear window does mean that you don’t have as much upright space for bulkier items. However, there’s nowhere to stash the big luggage cover when you don’t need it. The seats fold in a useful 40:20:40 split, so you can have two people sitting in the back and still have enough of a gap between them for longer loads. When they’re folded, they sit almost totally flat, with no lip between the boot and the seatbacks. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories Typically high-quality BMW interior, but it doesn’t feel particularly special The X2’s interior is very familiar from other BMW models, and is similar to the X1, 1 Series and 2 Series . The main standout on the dashboard is a huge swathe of glass under which sits a pair of displays - a 10.25-inch infotainment screen and a 10.7-inch digital instrument panel. Other than a few controls in the centre for volume and drive modes, these screens are what you’ll use for almost all the car’s functions - including climate control. The good news is that the central touchscreen is bright, clear and very responsive, and the interface has been largely designed with chubby fingers in mind so it’s not too difficult to operate. However, there are a lot of functions, so sometimes you do have to scroll quite a lot to reach the one you’re after. Interior quality is as high as you’d hope for from a BMW but if you poke around, you will find some cheap bits and pieces, which aren’t terrible but which start to grate if you’re looking at more expensive versions of the X2. Happily, unlike the Mercedes GLA, there are almost no dubious creaks, and every part of the interior that you touch feels expensive and well-built. An optional Technology Pack brings an auto-dimming rear-view mirror, adaptive LED lights, the aforementioned wireless charging pad and keyless entry. For a bit extra you can get the Technology Plus pack, which has a head-up display, BMW’s augmented-reality navigation system, and the ‘Iconic Glow’ illuminated grille. A Harman Kardon audio system is also available as an option, and sounds awesome. MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax The X2 is a tale of two halves when it comes to running costs. By far the more cost-effective option is the sDrive 20i mild hybrid petrol - it’ll officially return up to 48.7mpg, and CO2 emissions go as low as 131g/km. It’s the pick of the two models if you’re looking for low company car Benefit-in-Kind rates , though alternatives do offer plug-in hybrid powertrains with lower emissions still and correspondingly lower company car tax. On the other side of the coin, the M35i xDrive version will do an official 36.7mpg - and during our time with it, that figure was under 30mpg. Expect it to stay there if you regularly make use of the car’s performance. Those are pretty good figures, though - both models are significantly more fuel-efficient than the closest comparable Audi Q3 Sportback, Mercedes GLA or Cupra Formentor . There are no diesel engines for really low running costs, though, or a plug-in hybrid option. If you’d like a model that’s cheaper for company car use, then the all-electric BMW iX2 is the one for you. Safety and security Safety and security The BMW X2 hasn’t been individually tested by Euro NCAP , but the previous model inherited its rating from the BMW X1 and it’s likely the organisation will do the same with this generation. It’d be good news if it did, because the X1 scored a full five stars when it was tested in 2022 - with an exceptionally high score in the Safety Assist category. Safety equipment for the X2 is good, with the latest version of its autonomous emergency braking system even able to warn the driver of pedestrians or cyclists travelling parallel to the car that might be in the way when turning. The same system can warn you if you’re parked up and about to open your door into a passing bike. Optionally available, the Driving Assistant Plus package includes adaptive cruise control and advanced lane-keeping aids, plus automatic speed limit assistance. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems The old BMW X2 was quite problematic, as was the X1 it was based on. However, the latest X1 has proved quite dependable, with only one small recall since launch - this will of course be rectified on the X2 from the start. BMW’s standard warranty is just three years but unlimited mileage, making it useful for those who do lots of long journeys. It’s about on par with the warranties from Mercedes or Audi, but some Korean and Japanese brands do offer much longer coverage."

Is the BMW 8 Series Gran Coupe a good car? The 2019 BMW 8 Series Gran Coupe is the four-door version of the two-door BMW 8 Series flagship sports car . As such, the Gran Coupe’s front end is practically identical to its smaller sibling’s, sporting the same lean headlights and wide ‘kidney’ grille: the classic BMW trademark. Things change as you travel further backwards: the Gran Coupe has a more upright windscreen and rear window, intended to increase front headroom and boot space respectively. Oh yes, and then there’s the minor detail of the Gran Coupe having double the number of doors than the standard 8 Series coupe. The BMW 8 Series Gran Coupe’s wheelbase (the distance between the front and rear wheels) is 3,023mm – 201mm over the standard BMW 8 Series’. This means that the car will have more generous legroom for its rear passengers. Meanwhile, the steeper angle of the windscreen and rear windows will make for more headroom wherever you’re sat. BMW calls the Gran Coupe a “4+1-seater”, citing – alongside the two proper front and rear seats – the space for a fifth passenger in the middle of the rear bench, which, it claims, “is suitable for use on short journeys”. So, ideally, the Gran Coupe is best for accommodating anywhere up to four adults. The BMW 8 Series Gran Coupe has three engines for you to choose from: two petrols and one diesel. The entry-level version of the car – the 840i – is rear-wheel drive and has a six-cylinder petrol engine capable of putting out 340hp. This can take the Gran Coupe from 0-62mph in 5.2 seconds while returning a claimed fuel economy of up to 38.2mpg. From initial appearances, it seems that the mid-range 840d is going to be the pick of the 8 Series Gran Coupe range. It’s four-wheel-drive, meaning that – while its maximum power output is just 320hp – it can reach 62mph from a standstill in 5.1 seconds, with an impressive fuel economy of up to 45.6mpg. The range-topping, four-wheel-drive M850i trades economy for pure power. It goes from 0-62mph in only 3.9 seconds and has 530hp to play with. Sadly, BMW claims that it returns just 28.5mpg. We’ll have a full review on the BMW 8 Series Gran Coupe as soon as we’ve driven it.

https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/x3,BMW X3 Review & Prices,"€70,065",8/10,new,"Is the BMW X3 a good car? Is the BMW X3 a good car? The BMW X3 is an incredibly popular family SUV - more than 3.5 million have been sold since it launched in 2003. The latest model aims to stand out with its striking exterior design, ultra-modern interior and new plug-in hybrid engine. Both upmarket and eco-conscious, then, it’s like eating at a Nobu restaurant and ordering the vegan option. It’s one of BMW’s core SUV models, being larger than the X1 but smaller than the X5 - a true family SUV, making it an alternative to cars such as the Audi Q5 , Mercedes GLC , Volvo XC60 and Alfa Romeo Stelvio . At the same time, many growing families may be looking to increasingly posh offerings from less upmarket brands as a way to get more bang for their buck - think the Hyundai Santa Fe or Volkswagen Tiguan . The old X3 did look a bit like it had been designed by a committee, starting with a generic SUV shape and just pasting on BMW’s signature features such as the kidney grilles and quad headlights. The new model is much more distinctive, with a very clean look helped in no small part by ditching the black plastic cladding that used to adorn the wheel arches. There’s also an eye-catching new grille which has a mixture of diagonal and vertical lines - though racier models get a more conventional look - and which can even be illuminated by a thin LED strip around the outside. The sides are smooth, with faint sculpting giving the suggestion of a wheel arch, and recessed door handles mean there’s nothing to protrude. It’s a similar story at the rear, which has a smooth tailgate and big, angular LED taillights. Inside it’s an even bigger change. There’s a large twin-screen infotainment setup and an interesting knitted texture on the dashboard, though it’s great to see BMW’s retained some of the features we love such as the rotary controller for the infotainment system that makes it much easier to use on the move than a pure touchscreen. The most obvious feature, though, is that where BMWs of old may have used tons of chrome trim, in the new X3 it’s largely been replaced with huge hunks of translucent plastic through which sophisticated ambient lighting shines. It’s quite effective, particularly at night, but it’s definitely an acquired taste and does highlight that the interior doesn’t feel quite as luxuriously built as the old car, with some quite cheap and nasty materials around. It’s also not hugely spacious for family life. The front seats are roomy but the rears are only average, and there’s a big hump in the floor which makes the centre seat quite uncomfortable. The boot is a good size at 570 litres, marginally larger than an Audi Q5 or Alfa Romeo Stelvio, but it’s beaten easily by a Mercedes GLC or a VW Tiguan. Storage for smaller items is also a bit limited. There are four engines to choose from in the UK. There’s a 2.0-litre petrol or 2.0-litre diesel, both of which provide plenty of performance for everyday life. The most interesting is the 30e plug-in hybrid, which has up to 56 miles of all-electric range - meaning low company car tax bills and big potential fuel savings. All of these models are fairly pleasant to drive with comfortable suspension and refined engines, though they’re not quite as enjoyable as the old X3 was. At the top of the range there’s a rapid M50 model, which has a 3.0-litre six-cylinder engine and plenty of performance upgrades making it a totally different car to drive. This version of the X3 takes aim at the Audi SQ5 and Mercedes-AMG GLC 43 and does so pretty well, thanks to tidy driving dynamics and plenty of performance.

Remember Carwow can even help you to sell your old car when the time comes for car-changing. How much is the BMW X3? How much is the BMW X3? The new X3 starts at just over £48,000, though BMW says more than 70% of its customers opt for the M Sport model - which comes in at just over £50,000. The new Audi Q5 starts at just over £50,000, while the cheapest Mercedes GLC is almost £53,000, so the X3 is quite good value in comparison - though you can get a fully-loaded VW Tiguan or a very nice Hyundai Santa Fe for cheaper if you don’t mind having less badge kudos. The cheapest plug-in hybrid X3 is a bit over £57,000, which again is a couple of thousand less than the equivalent Mercedes GLC. You will probably want to add a few optional extras to your X3, though, and the cost can quickly stack up when you do. The Comfort or Comfort Plus packs are pricey but include a premium sound system and adaptive LED headlights, both very nice touches, while the Technology Pack adds in greater connectivity for the navigation and infotainment as well as a great head-up display. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort Very quiet and refined on the motorway, but the regular models aren’t much fun to drive Driving the X3 in town is really easy. All models get an eight-speed automatic gearbox which responds quickly and smoothly to your inputs, without the hesitation you sometimes get in alternatives. The plug-in hybrid is superior here thanks to its ability to drive on electric power alone, but the petrol models aren’t exactly rough or noisy either. Visibility is pretty good, even over your shoulder - there’s a large rear quarter window which minimises the blindspot. Every model gets all-round parking sensors and a reversing camera too, so parking’s really easy - and as an option you can have BMW’s Parking Assistant Plus, which will park the car for you and can even remember a complex reversing manoeuvre if you’ve parked in a very tight spot, for example. The X3 rides over bumps more firmly than the equivalent Mercedes GLC but it’s not particularly uncomfortable - you don’t feel like you’re thudding or bouncing. As an optional extra you can add adaptive suspension with Comfort and Sport modes, but this isn’t necessary as the standard suspension deals just fine with potholes and poor surfaces. If you want to maximise comfort, stick with the 18- or 19-inch wheels rather than the optional 20- or 21-inch affairs. The X3 makes a very relaxed motorway companion with very little wind and road noise. Again, a Mercedes GLC feels just a little more settled and refined here, but there’s not very much in it. BMW gives you a suite of driving assistance features as standard including cruise control, though an adaptive system is optional and it’s rather a pain that you can’t adjust your following distance without diving into the infotainment system - every other manufacturer allows you to do that with a button on the steering wheel. All of the engines have plenty of power for overtaking or short sliproads too, though the M50 model is no doubt the best here with ample horsepower in reserve - this model’s designed for high-speed autobahn cruising and so makes mincemeat of the M40. Older X3s were definitely among the best family SUVs to drive, but the gap’s narrowed here with the 2024 model. It’s not that the X3 is poor to drive on a winding country road, more that it’s no longer very enjoyable. The engines (with the exception of the M50) all sound rather flat and drony, and while the steering is accurate and has a nice weight to it it doesn’t inspire you to chase the corners in the same way that an Alfa Romeo Stelvio does. The M50 model, on the other hand, is quite good fun. With 398hp on tap, it’s certainly not short of power, and it also gets plenty of additional stiffening to both the suspension and to the chassis which help it corner very quickly but stay composed too. There’s also an electronically controlled differential, which can control where the power goes between the two rear wheels - helping you tighten up your line in bends. At nearly 2 tonnes in weight it’s not exactly a hot hatchback, but it’s a cut above a Mercedes-AMG GLC 43 in terms of enjoyment. Space and practicality Space and practicality A big boot, but space for rear passengers is only average Front seat occupants are very well treated in the X3. The comfortable sports seats get electric adjustment as standard, and there’s tons of reach and rake adjustment in the steering wheel so drivers of all shapes and sizes ought to be able to get comfortable. The M50 model has slightly firmer, more ‘huggy’ sports seats, but they’re not overly so. Storage for smaller items isn’t great though. The cupholders are big, and ahead of them there’s an upright tray where you can wirelessly charge your phone. The door bins aren’t very big, though, and nor is the glovebox. A six-foot passenger will be able to get comfortable behind a driver of a similar size, but there’s definitely more legroom and headroom in the back of a Mercedes GLC or a Volkswagen Tiguan. The rear bench is also quite flat, which by all rights should bode well for carrying a third passenger, but there’s a big hump in the floor which limits foot space and means you’ll only want to do very short journeys in the middle seat. You do get a good view out of the big rear windows, though, and there are sunblinds, charging ports and rear climate controls too. Isofix points are present and correct, though there’s not an overly generous amount of space to fit a bulky rear-facing car seat. The hard-backed front seats are also a little uncomfortable to press your knees into. The X3’s 570-litre boot is an excellent size, though it drops to a less capacious 460 litres for the plug-in hybrid model. That’s beaten slightly by the Mercedes GLC, which has 620/470 litres and is on par with the Audi Q5’s 550/465 litre space. It’s a nice square shape and the tailgate is really wide, so loading up is easy, and the seats fold flat in a nicely flexible 40:20:40 split rather than the plain old 60:40, so you can have two occupants at the same time as loading longer items. You can’t fold the seats flat from the boot, though - you have to go around to the side. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories Divisive styling, great infotainment but a noticeable drop in material quality The new X3’s interior is certainly eye-catching. Where the old car felt quite staid and sensible, the latest model has interesting features such as a big swathe of woven fabric trim, digital controls for the air vents, and huge chunks of translucent plastic through which the ambient lighting shines. The centre console is dominated by two huge screens for infotainment and driver information. The driver’s screen is 12.3 inches across and nicely configurable - you can have a full-screen map, even if you’re running Apple CarPlay or Android Auto , which is a nice touch. It’s also pin-sharp and bright, with all the key information easy to see. The infotainment screen is a huge 14.9 inches across, though it’s quite wide rather than tall so some apps like the sat-nav can feel more letterboxed than they do on a Mercedes GLC. The sheer number of menus can be intimidating, too, but it’s not too difficult to find what you’re looking for as most of the car’s key functions are quite high-level. Better still, BMW’s retained a rotary controller for the infotainment in the centre console - so when you’re on the move, you don’t need to fiddle about with the touchscreen. The cabin looks quite cool, with its reliance on the ambient lighting strips rather than tons of chrome trim. However, once you poke around, you do notice quite a few cheap materials. The panels on the door cards which contain controls for the air vents and the door handles feel particularly nasty, and while the fabric trim on the dash looks quite cool it does feel quite low-rent compared to the leather, veneer or Alcantara you get on a Mercedes GLC or Alfa Romeo Stelvio. MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax The X3’s four engines all return very different fuel economy figures. The entry-level unit is the 208hp 20i petrol - this is quick, smooth, and claims to return around 40mpg. A figure of 35mpg would be more realistic. Long-distance drivers will no doubt want the 20d diesel - it’s nice to see BMW still offers one, especially as the 3 Series and 5 Series saloons no longer have a diesel engine option. It has 197hp but is actually ever-so-slightly faster than the petrol to 62mph. It’s also quite a bit more efficient, claiming nearly 49mpg officially - we’d be quite sure of getting that on a gentle long run, but expect closer to 40-45mpg if you’re simply pootling around town. The 30e plug-in hybrid is potentially a great choice if it suits your lifestyle. It has 299hp, making it pretty rapid, but the most important number is that it has up to 56 miles of all-electric range on a charge - which is less than some key alternatives, but significantly more than most others. Even if that’s more like 40-50 miles in the real world, that should be enough to complete even the most gruelling morning commute without using any petrol power at all. You can then reserve the engine for longer journeys at the weekends. Of course, you’ll need to be able to charge at home or at work to make the most of this - the X3 can accept up to 11kW charging, bringing a full charge down to around two hours - and do bear in mind that, driven with a flat battery, the 30e is likely to be less efficient than even the entry-level petrol car due to the added weight of all those batteries. Then there’s the M50. This may claim an official consumption figure of 36.7mpg, but in the real world cresting 30mpg will be a struggle - especially if you’re making use of the ample power under your right foot. For company car drivers , the PHEV is the pick of the range, though it’s worth noting that a Mercedes GLC or Volkswagen Tiguan both fall into a lower tax bracket here due to their longer electric-only range. All X3s attract the expensive car supplement on yearly VED, too. Safety and security Safety and security Safety expert Euro NCAP has not yet tested the 2024 X3, but BMW’s track record would suggest there’s nothing to worry about here. Since 2017, there have been 15 of its cars with five-star ratings, most recently the 5 Series - so when the X3 is tested, we’d expect it to achieve this. Every model gets plenty of driving assistance kit as standard, including lane departure warning, speed limit info and lane change warnings, plus a reversing camera and all-round sensors for lower-speed work. Add the Driving Assistant Plus and you get adaptive cruise control as well as more sophisticated lane aids and autonomous emergency braking. BMW’s systems tend to be fairly unobtrusive in use, and you can turn off the irritating (and sadly mandated by law) speed limit warnings simply by holding down the ‘SET’ button on the steering wheel. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems The new X3 is, well, new, so there’s no way to comment on its reliability just yet. However, the latest 3 Series and 5 Series, with which the X3 shares its engines and tech, both posted pretty good scores in the latest Driver Power owner satisfaction survey, which is reassuring. BMW as a whole also scored quite well, coming 14th out of 32 manufacturers - well ahead of Mercedes and Audi. The BMW warranty is three years, the same as its main alternatives, but you do get unlimited mileage. BMW X3 FAQs BMW X3 FAQs"
https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/m135i,BMW M135i Review & Prices,"€25,330",8/10,used,"Is the BMW M135i a good car? Is the BMW M135i a good car? Trading in an older performance BMW to buy the M135i is a bit like skipping your favourite pudding to eat a low-fat alternative. You know that it’s better for you, but somehow the healthy option just isn’t as satisfying. A few years back, BMW replaced the full-fat, high-sugar M140i with the low-cal, high-fibre M135i. The old turbocharged six-cylinder petrol, rear-wheel-drive BMW M140i was fantastic at combining decent practicality with sledgehammer performance and a smile-inducing drive. Why then, has its successor, the BMW M135i, been given all-wheel-drive and a less-powerful turbo four-cylinder engine? Well, for better efficiency, mainly, which is a bit boring. That said, its alternatives such as the Mercedes-AMG A35 , Audi S3 and Golf R all offer the same recipe of all-wheel-drive traction and turbocharged four-cylinder power, and have proven themselves thrilling to drive too. The M135i’s new engine means it doesn’t get a long, sweeping bonnet like the car it replaces, but it still packs plenty of angular creases and a prominent grille to make sure it’s one of the sportiest-looking hot hatches around. Things are a little tamer inside, but the M135’s minimalist dashboard and handsome infotainment display look more modern than equivalents in the old car’s cabin. It’s easy to get the hang of and comes with plenty of bang-up-to-date equipment too, including Apple CarPlay, optional gesture controls and BMW’s personal assistant system. The latter is similar to the ‘Hey Mercedes’ feature in the A-Class . Less impressive are BMW’s optional digital dials for the driver which are a gloomy contrast to the crystal-clear display you get in Audis and Mercs. All-told, the Mercedes system has the most impressive tech, but BMW’s iDrive has the edge for usability. In terms of interior quality, the M135i and S3’s plastics, trims and switches are so closely matched it’s impossible to choose a winner. Due to its new engine layout, BMW has been able to redesign the 1-series’ cabin to maximise room for passengers. As a result, there’s more space in all five seats than in the old car so you should be able to carry tall adults in the back in reasonable comfort. The driver benefits from loads of seat and wheel adjustment too. The M135i’s boot is also bigger than in the old M140i, and more spacious than the load bay you’ll find in a Mercedes-AMG A35. Despite being less powerful than its predecessor, the BMW M135i is hardly a soft touch. Its turbocharged engine produces 306hp, which when sent through its standard eight-speed automatic gearbox and all-wheel-drive means 0-62mph in 4.8 seconds. That’s slower than before, yes, but not slow, and although six-cylinders will always sound better, the M135i still has a pleasing rasp when pushed hard. And the new M135i is marginally more comfortable over lumps and bumps in town, even with its stiffer, lower sports suspension. It also has a light, precise steering and decent forward visibility for easy urban manoeuvres. Rearwards it isn’t so good, but then, front and rear parking sensors are standard. Happily, the M135i is also comfortable and quiet on the motorway, but importantly it’s still great fun to thread along a country road, despite its move from rear to four-wheel drive. For some, the 1 Series’ high levels of grip and keen steering will never replace the feel of rear-wheel-drive, but it’s definitely possible to enjoy covering ground quickly. So, the latest M135i is good to drive, powerful and comes with a high-quality interior. If you like its new looks and don’t care that it’s four-wheel drive, then you’ll love it. But if you’re a petrolhead who fell for the old M140i’s creamy-smooth, even-more powerful straight-six engine and playful rear-wheel-drive setup, this new car may leave you feeling short-changed.

How much is the BMW M135i? How much is the BMW M135i? The M135i costs a lot for a hatchback, even a hot one. But then the likes of the old M140i, the Audi RS 3 and the AMG versions of the Mercedes A-Class have proven there’s a market for small but rapid premium cars. In fact, there are upmarket alternatives to the M135i which cost significantly more. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort Hugely quick, but not as involving as the best rear-wheel-drive BMWs For a car of such high performance, the M135i is easy to live with around town. It’s at its best if you upgrade to adaptive suspension, as this allows the driver to select ‘comfort’ mode which is forgiving of potholes and other lumps and bumps in the road surface. The standard suspension is firmer and sits closer to the road than the suspension of other 1 Series models. It’s more obviously a high-performance set up, less suited to everyday urban driving, but it stops short of being harsh. There is no manual gearbox, just an eight-speed auto, so your left leg won’t have any work to do in heavy traffic. The automatic ’box shifts gear smoothly. It can be a little hesitant to change down, though, which could catch you out as you go for a gap in traffic. Light steering helps make parking straightforward. The view over your shoulder could be better but front and rear parking sensors are standard, so this is less of a pain than it could be. Parking Assistant, which is available as a single option or part of the Technology Pack, helps the driver avoid obstacles and includes a rear-view camera. The M135i is a quick and comfortable tool for long motorway journeys. The suspension is better suited to high speeds rather than pootling around town, keeping the car firmly under control. Change lanes to overtake and there’s plenty of power to get up to speed, and the gearbox is less hesitant if you put it in sport mode. For such a rapid machine, fuel economy should be reasonable on a motorway drive – ditching the old M140i’s six-cylinder engine for a turbocharged four-cylinder petrol has to have some advantages. It’s not going to be as economical as a good diesel on a long run but the engine won’t be working hard at all at 70mph in top gear. This is what it’s all about. A hot hatch with over 300hp and a twisty road should be a match made in heaven. And yet, the M135i doesn’t quite hit the spot. Don’t get us wrong, it’s very quick, hugely grippy, and corners with poise. But it doesn’t deliver that wonderful feeling of being pushed out of a corner that you get from the best rear-wheel drive BMWs. It’s definitely still fun and a very efficient tool for covering ground quickly, but somehow the M135i is not as exciting as it could be. On the other hand, if it’s wet and slippery you’ll be glad of driving a car with xDrive four-wheel drive. It helps to use all that performance without making a BMW-shaped hole in the nearest hedge. Space and practicality Space and practicality Lots of space for a small car, although it’s a shame that lumbar adjustment costs extra The driver and front-seat passenger have lots of head and legroom. There’s a decent range of adjustment to the seat and wheel too, so whether you are short or tall you should find yourself comfortable. As standard the seats are finished in part-Alcantara and part-cloth. You can upgrade to black or red and grey leather at extra cost if you prefer, but it will cost a four-figure sum and the standard upholstery looks smart enough to our eyes. Back-pain sufferers will want to order the optional lumbar adjustment. It seems a bit cheap of BMW to make buyers pay extra for this. You can splash out further on electrical adjustment with a memory function – definitely handy if the car will routinely have more than one driver. Other interior options that are worth considering include a heated steering wheel, part of the Comfort Pack. You can also add a panoramic sunroof if you don’t mind losing a little headroom. There are twin cupholders at the base of the centre console, and large door bins. There’s more storage under the armrest. So all in all, the front of the cabin is practical and comfortable, especially if you remember to order your M135i with lumbar adjustment. If you’ve travelled in the older 1 Series models you’ll know they were very cramped in the back. Today’s car is a big improvement. A little more headroom would be nice, but a six-footer should fit without feeling crammed in, and there’s plenty of room under the front seats for their feet. Air vents between the front seats will keep rear-seat passengers cool. The rear doors open wider than before, which is a big plus if you are trying to fit a bulky child seat in the back. The seat is very flat, though. It’s almost like a park bench, albeit one that’s upholstered in high-quality materials. With 380 litres for your bags, the M135i’s boot capacity is much as you’d expect from a hatchback of this size. If you want a hot hatch with more room for luggage, take a look at the Skoda Octavia vRS , although this isn’t as quick as the M135i and lacks a prestige badge. The BMW is slightly ahead of the Mercedes A-class AMG A35 hatchback, while the Audi’s S3 hatchback is only at 325 litres. There’s some useful underfloor storage, and only a small load lip to lift bags over. A 60:40 split rear seat is standard, but buyers can opt for a more flexible 40:20:40 split at extra cost. This makes it a lot easier to carry two passengers in the back and still have space for long items like skis or snowboards. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories It can’t match the ‘wow’ factor of a Mercedes-AMG, but the M135i is very well made If you’re going to spend hours behind the wheel, you might as well do it somewhere with a modern design and a high standard of finish. You could certainly do a lot worse than racking up the miles inside a BMW M135i. You aren’t struck with the immediate visual impact of the twin-screen cockpit of a Mercedes-AMG A-Class, but the BMW’s cabin is better finished. Everywhere you look, and everything you touch, is made of luxurious materials that seem built to last. Straight ahead of you, there’s a digital display instead of conventional dials. We’re not fans of the way the rev counter seems to move backwards, and the screen is a bit dark. You also don’t have quite the same scope to personalise the display as you’ll find in hot hatches from Audi and Mercedes. But go back and sit in any car with conventional dials and it will look years out of date compared with the M135i. In the centre of the car but angled towards the driver is the 10.3-inch screen for the iDrive infotainment system. The easiest way to control it on the move is to use the rotary control and shortcut buttons near the gear lever. You can scroll through menus and make selections without having to take your eyes from the road for long. Prod at the screen if you prefer, but we only tend to do this when the car is stationary. Gesture control is available. If you’ve seen his video, review Mat loves this feature, although not everyone will agree with him. It takes a while to get the hang of which gestures do what, and once the novelty wears thin you’ll probably go back to using the iDrive controller. However you choose to control it, iDrive is one of the best systems around. It’s compatible with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto . MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax The siren-song of the old model’s six-cylinder engine has been sacrificed for the sake of better economy and lower emissions. To be fair to the turbocharged four-cylinder engine, there’s still a pleasant rasp to the exhaust and it does achieve good economy for an engine with 306hp. According to the official figures, you can expect 35.8-38.2mpg. The thing is, not many people buy a car with a 4.8-second 0-62mph time and then drive as if their driving instructor is in the passenger seat. You’ll need restraint and a gentle right foot to match the official fuel economy. Carbon dioxide emissions range from 168-179g/km, which is low for a performance car but relatively high for a small hatchback. The first year’s Vehicle Excise Duty is swallowed up in the price of the car, but for the following five years M135i owners will pay the higher rate of Vehicle Excise Duty. That’s because the BMW costs over £40,000, and all cars costing more than this amount are subject to an extra charge. If you are looking at the M135i as a company car, then it’s far from the most tax-efficient choice as it sits in the top 37% bracket. Safety and security Safety and security The BMW 1 Series scored five stars out of five when tested by Euro NCAP back in 2019. It picked up a rating of 83% for adult occupant protection, and 87% for child occupant safety. The scores for pedestrian protection and safety assistance systems were 76% and 72% respectively. You can choose to add more driver aids by opting for the Driving Assistant pack. This adds lane departure warning with blind spot detection, as well as an uprated autonomous emergency braking system that can detect pedestrians as well as cars. Rear crossing-traffic warning, which warns the driver if they’re at risk of a parking bump while reversing out of a space, is also part of this pack. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems BMW tends to be a midfield finisher in customer satisfaction and reliability surveys. The 1 Series has so far performed better than most BMWs, so it’s a car you can buy quite confidently. Just like a Mercedes-AMG A-Class, the M135i comes with a three-year, unlimited mileage warranty. The unlimited mileage policy is more generous than the cover Audi offers with the S3 and RS 3, which lasts for three years but is limited to 60,000 miles. BMW M135i FAQs BMW M135i FAQs"
https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/6-series-gran-coupe,BMW 6 Series Gran Coupe Review and Prices,"€87,635",8/10,new,"The BMW 6 Series Gran Coupe is one of the most luxurious cars the company makes. If you can’t quite see how it fits into BMW’s line-up, think of it as a sleeker, more stylish version of the 5 Series saloon. As such, it’s a worthy alternative to the Audi A7 and Mercedes S-Class Coupe. There’s a real elegance to the car’s styling and that kind of understated class and exclusivity is carried over to the cabin. Everything inside is wrapped in soft leather and the asking price guarantees one of the best-built BMW interiors. Essentially, it’s the same as you would get in the regular 6 Series. So, yes, it’s not the most stylish or most technologically advanced out there, but it is very driver-focused and easy to use. The infotainment system is one of the best around, and there’s no shortage of space or comfort in the front seats, either. As you can probably imagine, the shape of the rear doors and the way the roofline drops down at the rear of the car means it’s not easy for everyone to get into the rear seats, particularly if they’re tall. But, there’s actually enough room for a couple of adults in there, if just for a short distance. The only person who’ll really feel shortchanged is anyone sat in the middle seat, as it’s quite narrow and the position of the centre console means they have to sit legs akimbo. It’s a similar story with the boot: the opening is a bit restricted, but the boot itself is a good size. It’ll take 460 litres, which is not far short of what you have in a 7 Series, and you have the added bonus that the rear seats will fold down completely flat, if you want to extend that space. Don’t let all that practicality fool you, though. Under that sleek body beats the heart of the grandest of grand tourers – and that will be obvious after just a few miles behind the wheel. By that stage, you’ll know this car was made to cross continents in the quickest time possible while you remain in a cocoon of luxury and comfort. Buying a Six makes no sense: you can buy something that’s bigger and more practical for less money. But, there’s something wonderfully desirable about the Six that makes you just want it Given how heavy it is, the 6 Series Gran Coupe is remarkably well balanced and very stable at high speeds. The ride comfort is acceptable, even in the firmer ‘Sport’ setting, and the eight-speed gearbox works brilliantly in both manual and automatic modes. Other than a little wind noise, it’s very quiet inside, too, and the only major gripe is that the low-set seat means the view out is a little restricted – not ideal in a car as big as this. As you might only expect, there’s a fairly limited range of engines, but the good news is that they’re all brilliant. You can pick between two petrol engines and one diesel, all of which have two turbochargers, power and performance to spare, and reasonable running costs. The diesel-engined 640d is the pick of the bunch, because it’s just as fast as the similarly priced petrol-engined 640i, but is much cheaper to run, thanks to its impressive fuel economy. On the other hand, if you can afford the extra fuel bills, then there’s always the 650i with its 4.4 V8. And, if that still isn’t enough, there is always the 552bhp M6… Whichever engine you pick, the car will come with a reasonable amount of toys. Even the least expensive SE models have leather upholstery and the best version of BMW’s iDrive infotainment system. On top of that, there are gizmos like the optional head-up display that allows the driver to stay more focused on the road ahead, by projecting information including current speed, sat-nav directions and speed limits onto the windscreen. All in all, the BMW 6 Series Gran Coupe is a very well sorted and desirable executive car. It looks great, has a fabulous range of engines, is surprisingly good to drive and can carry four people in reasonable comfort. It’s well worth considering if you want a ‘four-door coupe’."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/m4-coupe,BMW M4 Coupe Review & Prices,"€125,196",9/10,new,"Is the BMW M4 a good car? Is the BMW M4 a good car? The BMW M4 is a high-performance coupe alternative to the likes of the Alfa Romeo Giulia Quadrifoglio , Audi RS5 and Mercedes-AMG C63. Mechanically speaking, it’s pretty much identical to the M3 saloon but was spun off a few years ago into its own model as a sleeker coupe version of the famous 3 Series . The latest model has just as much punch as you’d expect from an M car, but brings a bit of a dilemma in design too. You see, BMW has been a bit like your teenage son or daughter rebelliously sneaking out one afternoon to get a nose piercing you’ve told them not to. It was known BMW had plans for the snarling great grille you see at the front of the M4 but, despite widespread outcry not to do it, it went ahead and put it into production anyway. Whether you love the looks or hate them, there’s more to the outlandish styling of the BMW M4 than just the ‘kidney’ (maybe lungs would be appropriate) grille. Huge intakes sit either side of the lower front bumper, while down the side swollen wheel arches make it stand out from a regular 4 Series. In fact, the only bit of bodywork shared with the standard car is the boot lid — though here it has a spoiler tacked on top. You’ll see a quad-exit exhaust sat below a carbon fibre diffuser, and happily, those huge tailpipes are real. You can choose between different alloy wheel designs, with the front pair 19 inches and the rear 20 inches in size. You won’t mistake the BMW M4 for a run-of-the-mill 4 Series inside. It’s laden with M-coloured stitching, M-badges all over and if that wasn’t enough, it’s like somebody vomited carbon fibre everywhere. A thick model-specific steering wheel is joined by standard electrically-adjustable sports seats that come with illuminated M logos, though you can opt for carbon fibre bucket seats if you want a more race car-akin feel. This version of the BMW M4 is a bit longer than the old car as well, so there’s more room in the back. It’s pretty decent for legroom considering it’s a coupe, but headroom is pretty limited because of the sloping roofline. For no extra cost in the BMW M4 , you get a fantastic infotainment system. It’s intuitive and dead easy to use, plus there’s finally support for Android Auto in addition to Apple CarPlay . Both can be connected wirelessly, as well. In front of you, there’s a 12.3-inch digital drivers display for key driving info, and these have plenty of customisation to them too, including racy-looking M-specific displays. There’s a reasonable amount of boot space in the BMW M4 , with 440 litres. That’s 35 more than the old car and a fair bit more than the Mercedes-AMG C63’s 355 litres, although 40 down on the saloon, and 60 behind the M3 Touring - the king of practical performance. If you’re buying a BMW M4 though, you’re likely after performance — and this latest version has bags of it. Its 3.0-litre twin-turbocharged straight-six engine is good for 510hp and 650Nm of torque in Competition form (which is all you can get in the UK), sent to the rear wheels through an eight-speed automatic gearbox. It fires the M4 from 0-60mph in 3.9 seconds and on to a 155mph limited top speed. You can get that raised to 180mph as part of a package that also includes carbon-ceramic brakes, but it’ll cost you thousands of pounds. When you’re driving it hard, it doesn’t feel quite as spiky and unpredictable as the old car — in part because of amazing levels of grip at the rear. It feels sharper than the likes of the Audi RS5 , yet not as intimidating as the last M4. It’s not just a brutal performance car though and does the normal stuff pretty well. Switch everything into Comfort mode and you can cruise along with lighter steering, though the suspension still has a pretty firm edge to it. Just as you would your firstborn if they rocked back home with a nose piercing though, you can look past the styling and appreciate the BMW M4 for how amazing it is. You might even grow to like the looks, too. If you do, check out the latest BMW M4 deals to see how much you could save.

You’re going to need deep pockets to buy an M4, that’s for sure, but alternative performance coupes will also take a big chunk from your bank balance. A Mercedes-AMG C63 costs even more, although the Alfa Romeo Giulia Quadrifoglio and Audi RS5 are a touch cheaper. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort The BMW M4 is a sublime and sharp performance car, but alternatives are a bit more comfortable If you want a performance coupe that’s comfy around town, try the Audi RS5. The BMW M4 always feels like a sporty car, with a firmness to the ride even with the suspension in its most comfortable setting. It’s not rock hard by any means, but you always know you are driving an M-car rather than a regular BMW 4 Series. You can’t buy an M4 with a manual gearbox in the UK, which is a shame. But being auto-only does make for easy progress in heavy traffic. The M4 is happy to creep along smoothly, although the powerful brakes can be a little grabby at low speeds. The weight of the steering can be adjusted, and the lightest setting makes for easy manoeuvres. A better view over your shoulder would though help when reversing into a tight parking spot. BMW Parking Assistant Plus is available as an extra and includes a 360-degree camera system which can be configured to show different views of the car's surroundings, giving no excuse for kerbing those big alloy wheels. The motorway limit is little more than a brisk walk for the M4. It’s limited to 155mph but that restriction can be lifted to 180mph as part of a package that also includes carbon-ceramic brakes. Choose the most comfortable suspension setting, soften off the throttle and gearbox responses, and select a quiet mode for the exhaust, and the M4 will happily cover long distances. There’s a bit more tyre noise than in a regular 4 Series, but the M4 is very civilised for a performance car. The brakes – even if you don’t go for the carbon-ceramic upgrade – are exceptionally strong. They’re really reassuring if you need to make an emergency stop from motorway speeds. When you’re driving it hard, the BMW M4 doesn’t feel quite as challenging to drive at higher speeds as the old car — largely in part because of amazing levels of grip at the rear. It’s more fun than an Audi RS5 , yet not as edgy as the last M4. The M4’s 3.0-litre twin-turbocharged straight-six engine is seriously powerful with 510hp and 650Nm of torque in Competition form. That makes for mind-bending acceleration. The rear-wheel-drive version of the M4 shoots from 0-62mph in 3.9 seconds. Go for the Competition M xDrive and the car has four-wheel drive, cutting the 0-62mph time to just 3.5 seconds. There’s a rear bias to the four-wheel-drive set-up, so the handling is no less sharp. It’s just easier to use the car’s staggering performance, even if the road is damp. Space and practicality Space and practicality Boot space is pretty good in the BMW M4, though rear headroom isn’t fantastic and the front seats aren’t particularly welcoming for those with a larger figure The M4 is practical for a performance car. This is no weekend toy – you could easily drive it every day, especially if you don’t use the back seats too often. It’s simple enough to find a comfortable driving position, thanks to the range of adjustment to the seat and wheel. The seats are heavily bolstered to hold you in place while cornering, which is great on a country road, but not so great if you are carrying a bit of timber. If you fit the seats, though, they are very comfy. M Carbon bucket seats are available as an option, which reduce weight by 9.6kg and can be lowered really close to the floor, which will be handy if you plan to tackle the odd track day in your M4 and need enough headroom to wear a helmet. Both the standard and optional front seats have electrical adjustment and heating. You don’t buy a car like this for its storage space but being based on the sensible 4 Series turns out to be a good thing. There are twin cupholders at the base of the centre console, and huge door bins with room for a large flask or bottle. There’s more space under the armrest and the glovebox is big enough to be useful. There’s space for two in the back. It’s pretty decent for legroom by coupe standards, but headroom is pretty limited because of the sloping roofline. Upgrade to the carbon bucket front seats though and there’s a little more space in the rear — so passengers can slouch a little for more headroom if they like. Adults will be comfortable enough, provided they’re not too tall. There are ISOFIX mounting points in the back so you can fit child seats securely. It’s not going to be easy to get a bulky seat through the narrow gap between the front seat and door frame, though. Anyone with kids will be better served by the M3 Saloon or M3 Touring. There’s a reasonable amount of boot space in the BMW M4 , with 440 litres. That’s 35 more than the old car and a fair bit more than the Mercedes-AMG C63’s 355 litres. You get an electric tailgate as standard as well, which will help take off the load if you’re lugging in lots of cargo. If you’re not sure whether the coupe’s boot is big enough, the BMW M3 Touring delivers similar performance and handling but with 500 litres for your bags. In fact, the M3 saloon also has more space, with a 480-litre capacity. For a coupe, though, the M4’s boot is pretty good. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories Like carbon fibre? You’ll be right at home in the BMW M4. But it’s a shame some of the infotainment buttons have been taken out The BMW M4 is a real departure from the regular 4 Series inside. It’s laid out the same, but carbon fibre is splashed literally everywhere — with plenty of M badges and branded stitching to match. You get a thick-rimmed M steering wheel as well that really sets the tone. You just know you’re going to enjoy driving the M4 even before the twin-turbo six-cylinder engine barks into life. The M4 launched with twin screens in the cabin, with a 12.3-inch display ahead of the driver and a centrally mounted 10.3-inch touchscreen infotainment system. Since the spring of 2023 BMW has upgraded the M4’s cabin with the latest BMW Operating System 8. There’s still a 12.3-inch screen in place of old-fashioned dials, but it now meets up with a huge 14.9-inch infotainment display. The two screens look like one wide curved display. The quality of the graphics and depth of colour is really breathtaking. The only trouble is, the original twin-screen set-up was easier to use. BMW has taken away some of the physical buttons that were fitted to the car originally, so you now control the air conditioning using icons along the bottom of the screen instead. It’s not so easy to make quick adjustments without taking your eyes from the road. Fortunately, BMW hasn’t ditched the iDrive rotary controller. This is much easier to use on the move than prodding at the screen. So overall, the new system is still one of the best infotainment packages around. It’s certainly one of the best to look at. As well as the two screens, every M4 has a head-up display. It places key information such as the car’s speed directly in the driver’s line of sight. Don’t think it’s a gimmick – once you’ve driven a car with a head-up display you won’t want to go back. MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax f you worry about emissions and want a performance car with a low carbon footprint, the BMW i4 M50 could suit you better than the M4. It’s not quite as rewarding to drive but being fully electric there are no exhaust emissions. For a petrol-powered car with over 500hp, the M4 Competition is quite efficient. But in absolute terms, there’s no denying that this is a thirsty car with high emissions. You can expect 28.8mpg from the rear-wheel drive model, according to the official figures. Enjoy the performance and you won’t get near that. The four-wheel drive M xDrive model is a little heavier and thirstier than the standard car, but there’s not a huge difference. In official tests the car returned up to 28.2mpg. Again, use the M4 the way it’s intended to be driven and you’ll burn through fuel at a faster rate. In terms of carbon dioxide emissions, the M xDrive emits 227-229g/km. The rear-wheel drive car emits 223g/km. You’ll pay a four-figure sum to cover the Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) when the car is first registered, although it’s swallowed up within the on-the-road price. As any M4 costs well over £40,000, the £390 VED surcharge will apply for the following five years. Swap your petrol head with a head for figures, and the M4 doesn’t add up for company car drivers. If the fleet manager is willing to sign off on an M4 you’ll pay benefit-in-kind at the top rate of 37%. With the low tax rates for electric cars , the i4 makes a far more sensible choice for business drivers. But where’s the fun in being sensible? Safety and security Safety and security The safety experts at Euro NCAP haven’t tested the M4, but they have tested the 4 Series on which it’s based. It earned five stars out of five back in 2019. The rating for adult occupant protection was an exceptional 97%. Child occupant protection was rated at 83%, vulnerable road user protection scored 93%, and the car’s safety assistance systems scored 72%. You can add more driver assistance features if you start ticking boxes for optional extras, although this can quickly get expensive. Driving Assistant Professional is part of the Technology Plus Pack. It adds Automatic Speed Limit Assist, Cross Traffic Warning (front), Crossroads Warning with City Brake Function, Lane Keeping Assistant, Traffic Light Detection and more. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems Read through reliability surveys and customer satisfaction studies, and you’ll find BMW has a mixed reputation and iIt often finishes in the mid-field. So while the M4 may not match the likes of the Lexus RC F for fuss-free ownership, it’s no lemon either. Like any BMW, the M4 comes with a three-year, unlimited mileage warranty. The Audi RS5 also has three years of cover, but with a 60,000-mile limit. If you are buying a used M4 , check how long is left to run on the original warranty and think about arranging cover if the new car warranty has expired."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/x5-m-competition,BMW X5 M Competition Review & Prices,"€164,713",8/10,new,"Is the BMW X5 M Competition a good car? Is the BMW X5 M Competition a good car? The BMW X5 M Competition has so much going for it, it’s a bit like a car designed via a focus group. It’s spacious, practical, has a lovely cabin, great infotainment and is fast yet comfy. Oh, this focus group all live in Monaco, by the way. Yep, the X5 M Competition is watery-eye expensive. More than £100,000 expensive. It isn’t alone, however, because it competes with other blisteringly quick large SUVs such as the Mercedes-AMG GLE 63 and Porsche Cayenne , which aren’t exactly budget cars. You can’t be the shy and retiring type to own an X5 M Competition, with its gaping black grille, huge air intakes, huge wheels, large exhausts and vivid unique paint colours helping it stand out over the standard X5. And, if by some miracle you’d missed the exterior, the X5 M Competition’s interior is every bit as in-your-face. Think seriously figure-hugging seats with quilted stitching, aluminium trim, sports pedals and ambient lighting. Of course, there’s the chance to up the ante with BMW’s options list, but a superb fit and finish are standard. One thing that stays the same versus stand X5s is the infotainment system, although it’s one of the best in the business. It’s BMW’s top-end Professional system, which gets a 12-inch screen that can be controlled by touch, a rotary dial between the front seats or even a very good voice control system. It also gets Apple CarPlay as standard (with Android Auto to follow in time), although you’ll have to pay for it beyond year one and Mercedes’ digital dials are more visually impressive and configurable than the ones you get as standard in the BMW. Two adults in the front of the BMW X5 M Competition will have no issues with space, and the same goes for another couple of tall adults behind them in the back. The X5 M Competition keeps the standard cars’ huge 650-litre boot too, which has the added benefit of a split tailgate. Elsewhere in the world the BMW X5 M Competition also comes as simply an X5 M with 600hp, but here in the UK it’s the full-fat 625hp Competition model or nothing. That V8 petrol sends this 2.4-tonne behemoth to 62mph from standstill in just 3.8 seconds. That’s supercar fast. And while it won’t lap a track as quickly as BMW’s fastest M cars, the X5 M Competition’s huge tyres, stiff, adaptive suspension, clever differential, extra bracing and quicker steering all help it feel just about as agile as an SUV can, even without the rear-wheel steering of some alternatives. As such, in town, this big SUV doesn’t feel quite so nimble, but on the motorway it’ll breeze down slip roads and overtake faster-moving traffic with a simple twitch of the right foot, all the while remaining more comfortable and quiet than it has any right to be given its sporty intentions. It all sounds great, but it’s worth bearing in mind that the also-V8 BMW X5 M 50i model does 90% of what this M Competition model can do while being vastly cheaper. However, if you have the budget and the need for the pinnacle of BMW SUVs, then the X5 M Competition will satisfy and then some. Make sure you head to our BMW deals page for the very best prices.

The BMW 8 Series is a sumptuous grand tourer with a luxurious interior, four seats and a surprising turn of speed. Go for a range-topping M850i model, and this BMW has the pace to take on the likes of the likes of the V8 Aston Martin DB11 , the Bentley Continental GT and the Lexus LC . The BMW 8 Series’ interior might not have the same pizzaz as these more expensive rivals, but you still get an extremely sumptuous cabin with lashings of posh Merino leather and huge slabs of brushed metal. The tall centre console comes with a few too many fiddly buttons, but above it you’ll find a vast touchscreen infotainment display that’s one of the best around. It’s far easier to use than the clunky last-generation Mercedes system you get in the Aston Martin DB11 and it comes with some of the coolest graphics you’ll see this side of a Lamborghini – most noticeably on the standard digital driver’s display. Thankfully, the BMW 8 Series is more practical than a Lamborghini – and most other large coupes for that matter. There’s ample space in the front for very tall drivers to stretch out and you even get a pair of back seats as standard. Sure, these will be a very tight squeeze for adults but kids will have plenty of space to get comfy. There’s space in the boot for a couple of medium suitcases and you can even fold the back seats down to carry long luggage, too. This isn’t a car you’ll want to take to the tip, however – more likely you’ll be blasting down the autobahn or storming up a mountain pass on your way to the ski chalet. Speaking of which, driving the BMW 8 Series for long distances is an absolute doddle. The standard adaptive suspension does an excellent job ironing out potholes and even the most raucous M850i V8 model emits merely a whisper in eighth gear at motorway speeds. Turn onto a twisty back road, put it in Sport mode and hit the throttle and this relaxing grand tourer transforms into a surprisingly lithe sports car faster than you can say ‘hold on in the back!’. The 4.4-litre twin-turbo V8 produces a whopping 523hp which – combined with a grippy four-wheel-drive system – rockets the 8 Series from 0-62mph at a rate that’d make some supercars blush. The standard eight-speed automatic gearbox is one of the best in the business, too – shifting quickly and smoothly, no matter which of the driving modes you choose. Stick it in Sport and it’ll even sense when you’re entering a corner and prime the gearbox to deliver lightning-fast downshifts as soon as you hit the brakes. Go one step further into Sport+ mode and the standard adaptive suspension becomes firmer to make the four-wheel-drive M850i as squat and purposeful as possible. You can even get the car with an active anti-roll system that uses electric motors to physically lean the car into a corner as soon as you turn the steering wheel. Thankfully, BMW’s considered more than just what makes a car great fun to drive on a country road. The BMW 8 Series comes with four-wheel steering to help make it as stable as possible on the motorway and more manoeuvrable than its large size would suggest around town. That said, threading this imposing grand tourer through tight gaps in traffic is still a slightly nerve-wracking experience. Rear visibility is pretty poor and the small side windows don’t give you a particularly good view out. You could level these criticisms at almost every slinky four-seat sports car on sale, however, and they quickly fade into the background when you consider the BMW 8 Series’ impressive breadth of abilities. It’s an excellent long-distance cruiser yet summons up some sports car skills when you fancy having fun on a deserted back road.

Check out how to you can sell your car through carwow , too. How much is the BMW 8 Series? How much is the BMW 8 Series? Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort The BMW 8 Series is a comfortable motorway cruiser which also feels sporty when you fancy taking the long way home. You do have to pay extra for its fancy suspension upgrades, though Despite its very large size, the BMW 8 Series is pretty easy to drive. Sure, the narrow windscreen and thick door pillars create a few sizeable blind spots at junctions, but the light steering means your arms won’t get tired if you have to thread the BMW 8 Series through tight city streets. It’s surprisingly manoeuvrable too, thanks to a clever four-wheel-steering system which angles the rear wheels outwards to help you perform U-turns in tight spaces. Furthermore, the 8 Series' standard-fit adaptive suspension system does a good job at ironing out bumps in the road around town. That same suspension system also makes the BMW 8 Series very comfortable when you're driving on the motorway. Combine that with the quiet cabin, and the BMW is a very relaxing car to travel in for long periods. It’s especially stress-free to cruise in if you pay extra for the Driving Assistant Professional pack. This comes with adaptive cruise control and lane-keeping assist features that work together to accelerate, brake and steer for you on motorways – providing you keep your hands on the steering wheel. f you’d rather do the driving yourself, you won’t be disappointed when you switch off the BMW 8 Series’ electronic chauffeur and head onto some twisty country roads. Put it into Sport or Sport+ mode and the adaptive suspension becomes firmer, the steering weightier and the throttle response sharper – all of which help the BMW 8 Series feel more agile than its generous proportions would have you believe. Pick an M850i model with the optional Adaptive M suspension and the BMW 8 Series feels even more nimble and sure-footed thanks to some clever mechanical trickery that physically leans the car’s body into bends at speed. Overall, the BMW 8 Series feels much sportier than the rather sedate Mercedes S-Class Coupe and Lexus LC pairing on a windy country road, yet doesn’t compromise on comfort when you just want to settle into a quiet cruise. Space and practicality Space and practicality The BMW 8 Series is no practical family hauler, but its boot is bigger than those in most slinky two-door sports cars The BMW 8 Series is a vast car, but you’ll only find four seats inside. In the front, there’s plenty of leg- and headroom for you to get comfortable – even if you’re very tall – and the seats come with loads of electric adjustment as standard to help you find a comfortable seating position and get a good view out. You won’t have any trouble storing a few odds and ends in the BMW 8 Series’ cabin. The glovebox is reasonably roomy and you get a fairly large storage bin under the central armrest. Fold up a flap in front of the gear lever and you’ll find a pair of cupholders and a tray for your phone with a built-in wireless charger. Unfortunately, the door bins – while very long – are too narrow to accommodate anything wider than a 500ml bottle and passengers in the back don’t get a folding armrest or any cupholders. Space in the back is pretty poor – even for a low-slung sports car. There’s space for two kids but even small adults will start to feel pretty claustrophobic after a few minutes in the back. You can fit a pair of child seats in the back, but lifting the seat through the narrow gap between the BMW 8 Series’ front seat and the door pillar feels like squeezing a tank through a multi-storey car park. At least the Isofix anchor points are easy to locate behind a set of removable plastic covers, but leaning in to strap in a child requires the flexibility of a gymnast. The BMW 8 Series isn’t particularly adept at carrying passengers, but it claws back some points with its impressively roomy boot – for a two-door sports car, at least. You’ll be able to squeeze in 420 litres of luggage, that’s around 5% more than in a Mercedes S-Class Coupe and more than double what you can fit in the Lexus LC’s boot. There’s quite a large lip by the BMW 8 Series’ boot opening which makes lifting in heavy luggage rather tricky, but once you’ve dealt with this you’ll find there’s space for a set of golf clubs or a few large suitcases. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories The BMW 8 Series’ interior looks great, feels very plush and comes with loads of high-tech features, but it isn’t as eye-catching as the cabins you get in more expensive alternatives The BMW 8 Series’ interior does a great job of looking sporty and feeling luxurious. Every surface – from the soft leather-trimmed dashboard to the brushed metal trims on the centre console – feels just as solid as in the uber-posh 7 Series . The knurled stainless steel finish on the centre console feels particularly lovely and the crystal-effect gear knob is a nice change from the rather amorphous plastic blob you get in most other BMWs. Every BMW 8 Series comes with a pair of huge digital displays. One sits on top of the dashboard and controls the car’s sat-nav and media-streaming features while the other takes the place of conventional analogue dials in front of the steering wheel. The former is a 10.25-inch touchscreen with some of the sharpest graphics of any in-car display. It’s bright enough to read in almost direct sunlight and the mostly colourful icons are easy to read with a quick glance. Some of the BMW 8 Series’ menus feel a little more complicated than those in the likes of the Mercedes S-Class but you can always use the handy rotary controller and shortcut buttons down on the centre console to quickly jump from one feature to another if you get a little lost. You can also use voice control to program the standard satellite navigation without taking your hands off the steering wheel. This works reasonably well but you can use the touchscreen to enter an address using a conventional on-screen keyboard if you prefer. It calculates directions quickly and the screen responds without any irritating lag if you swipe to pan across the map to check out the route ahead. It’s possible to use the 12.3-inch digital driver’s display to show a large widescreen sat-nav display – perfect if your passenger insists on fiddling with the central screen – or you can have it show a set of cool vertical speedometer and rev-counter gauges which look like they belong in a sci-fi jet plane. Unfortunately, while Apple CarPlay comes as standard, you can’t get the BMW 8 Series with Android Auto smartphone mirroring. At least the former works well and lets you make calls, use your preferred navigation apps and play music through the car’s infotainment system."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/i7,BMW i7 Review & Prices,"€167,371",9/10,new,"Is the BMW i7 a good car? Is the BMW i7 a good car? The BMW i7 is an electric saloon that has some controversial looks and joins the iX as the electric flagship of the BMW line-up. It’s the electric alternative to the 7 Series and features the latest battery technology from the German firm. It’s a lot like buying a nice faux leather jacket instead of one made from a cow. Looks-wise, the i7 will definitely split opinions. But once you’re used to it, the large kidney grilles and split headlights look pretty smart, while the long bonnet exudes class. The limousine styling continues down the side, so it can look a bit slab-sided, but the optional two-tone paint option could be a master stroke if you like that sort of thing. From the rear, it’s pretty square, and you don’t get a full width light bar that is all the rage these days. You also get a lot of blue ‘electricity’ accents around the car to make it visually different from the 7 Series. You get one of the nicest-feeling interiors around in the i7, with lots of leather – or vegan leather if you prefer – alongside crystally controls for the seat adjustment and gear lever. There’s also a lovely crystal strip that lights up depending on the climate control or interior ambience. But the highlight of the i7 is the optional cinema widescreen in the back. Folding down from the roof, it can stream your favourite shows or films on-demand, and it’s all controlled via voice commands or a door-mounted touchscreen. You can also get business class-style rear seats that recline to make you feel even more at home and comfortable on long drives. The main point of the i7 isn’t the boot space, but you still get 500 litres to work with. You can’t fold the seats down to increase load capacity, which is a shame, and the i7 loses 25 litres compared to the plug-in hybrid 7 Series models. It’s also considerably down on the Mercedes EQS , which offers 610 litres. The compact battery pack has a 102kWh capacity, and with that you can go up to 388 miles on a single charge. That is quite a way off the best for the Mercedes EQS, which can do up to 441 miles. Out on the road, the i7 starts to surpass the Mercedes EQS, as well as some other big high-end EVs like the Tesla Model S . With the adaptive air suspension setup, bumps are barely noticeable and you’ll have next to no trouble on a long journey, where you can use the adaptive cruise control to make for a serene drive. There’s no hiding that in town it feels all of its 5.4m, but with the help of all around cameras, you’ll be able to make smooth progress. The instant electric power also makes getting in and out of junctions easy. The i7 can also park itself while you keep an eye on your surroundings. On the whole, the i7 is a comfortable and an accomplished limo that the Mercedes EQS and Tesla Model S will struggle to match. Although the Mercedes will go further on a charge, the i7 manages to be more fun to drive and packed with even more kit. While it may divide opinions with its looks, it's definitely the leader in the premium electric market. If you like what you see, check out the latest BMW i7 deals available through Carwow. We’ve also got a wide selection of used BMWs , and if you’re looking to sell your car online , we can do that too. How much is the BMW i7? How much is the BMW i7? The BMW i7 isn’t cheap — which is possibly the least surprising thing we could say about it. It comes with a six-figure price tag even in its most basic eDrive50 form, and it’s a few thousand pounds more expensive than the equivalent entry-level Mercedes EQS. In fact, the EQS has a price advantage against all like-for-like versions of the i7 - the all-wheel drive i7 xDrive60 costs about the same as the flagship AMG version of the EQS, and the sporty i7 M70 is considerably pricier than its aforementioned EQS AMG rival. Against the Audi e-tron GT quattro , the i7 is way more expensive, and the Audi is faster, but it can’t match the BMW’s claimed range on a full charge (although their real-world figures are somewhat closer). It’s also nowhere near as spacious and comfortable as the i7. It’s a similar story when you start comparing the BMW with the Porsche Taycan . The Porsche is, in 4S form, faster, more fun, and much more affordable, but not quite so long-ranged and certainly not as spacious nor as comfortable inside. A Tesla Model S is also more affordable to buy than the i7, and like the EQS it has the BMW licked when it comes to range (up to 405 miles, depending on the model). However, the Tesla isn't as comfy or as plush inside as the BMW, and if you order a new Model S you can only have one in left-hand drive. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort The BMW i7’s greatest asset is its comfort — it’s exceptionally refined and smooth to drive, although it’s still a big and heavy saloon so doesn’t have the poise of lighter cars The i7 is a really big car. It’s a full 5.3 metres long, which means it’s around three feet longer than, say, a Ford Focus . It’s also quite tall and broad, so you do need your wits about you when driving around town, and narrow lanes or tight car parks can be a potential nightmare. Thankfully, there are some systems which can help to take the strain. You can optionally have four-wheel steering, which turns the rear wheels by up to 3.5 degrees and instantly makes the i7 feel more nimble around town and which means it’ll get around tight corners with a little more ease. Plus there’s a very good all-round camera system which helps with low-speed manoeuvres and parking, not to mention an excellent and very clever automated parking system which can remember and repeat parking moves at regular destinations. There’s even a washer jet for the rear-facing camera to keep it clear of road grime. You can also have a remote driving function, which works via the BMW app on your smartphone, allowing you to shuffle the car in and out of very tight parking spaces while standing outside. The standard adaptive air suspension helps around town too, as it can lift up the nose by 20mm to help cope with steep driveways or XXL speed bumps. A long motorway drive is where the i7 is in its natural habitat. The air suspension actually lowers slightly at high speeds to make the car more aerodynamic, but that doesn’t mean that it also becomes stiffer or more uncomfortable. Actually, it’s one of the smoothest, most soft-riding cars you can buy and it’s exceptionally relaxing to drive on a long journey. The adaptive cruise control and lane-keeping steering help, too. They’re not fully autonomous — of course — so you’re still in charge, but they’re very good at keeping a safe distance from the car in front and holding you between the white lines. The only thing is you’ll need to keep an eye on them as they don’t always seem to pick up speed signs, although when the system does recognise the local limit it will automatically slow you down, which should keep the speeding tickets at bay. Joining a fast-moving motorway is pretty easy too, as all versions of the i7 are very quick - even the least potent rear-wheel drive cars have 455hp on tap, so they can accelerate from 0-62mph in 5.5 seconds, and the 544hp all-wheel drive model completes the same sprint in 4.7 seconds. Opt for the 659hp M70 range-topper, and you'll have a BMW i7 that can dash to 62mph from a standing start in just 3.7 seconds - not bad for a luxury limo that weighs nearly 2.8 tonnes. All the softness and refinement might make you think that BMW has forgotten its old ‘Ultimate Driving Machine’ slogan when it comes to getting the i7 to go around corners. Nothing could be further from the truth. That air suspension also has an optional active anti-roll system which keeps the body almost dead-level when cornering, and the i7’s steering is fast and accurate, if not quite as sharp as you might find in some smaller, lighter BMWs. The result is a limo that can corner properly, and you can even have some fun throwing this big, heavy car around. It’s far lighter on its toes in corners than the Mercedes EQS for example, although not as good to drive as the smaller, less roomy Audi e-tron GT. Space and practicality Space and practicality There’s lots of space in the i7’s cabin — not to mention tremendous comfort — but like the interior stowage options, the boot isn’t as big nor as versatile as it could be The driving position of the i7 is very good, and with the controls for the electrically-adjusted front seats mounted up high on the door panels, you won’t have to fumble around down by your hips to find the right position. Seat comfort is exceptional, and there’s plenty of legroom and headroom in the front for even the tallest drivers and front-seat passengers. The felt-lined door bins stop stuff rattling around in them, but they could be slightly more generous in size. There’s more storage space under the front armrest but it’s slightly shallow. You get two cupholders in the front, and in front of those is a storage area which is also home to the wireless phone charging pad. The glovebox opens electrically, by pressing a touch-sensitive button on the dashboard, and it’s felt-lined to prevent rattles as well, although again it’s not the most generously-sized storage space. Rear seat passengers are exceptionally well-cared for, as the i7 is as good for space in the back as standard as the old long-wheelbase version of the 7 Series. There’s proper stretching-out space, although the rear seats are really shaped for two, not three people so anyone in the centre rear seat is going to feel a bit cheated. The seat behind the front passenger can also fully-recline, like a business-class airline seat, although it also moves that front passenger seat forwards and partially folds it, so you can’t have anyone other than the driver sat in the front to get the full premier passenger experience. On a more practical note, you get ISOFIX anchor points — easily accessible ones, too — in the outer rear seats, and storage space and cupholders in the fold-away centre arm-rest. There are also decent-sized door bins and map pockets in the backs of the front seats. Rear seat passengers also get their own USB charging sockets, mounted usefully high-up in the centre of the front seat backs. The best bit? Probably the ultra-soft and comfy little pillows, attached to the rear headrests! The i7 offers 500 litres of boot space under its standard electrically-powered boot lid, which is 25-litres less than you get in the petrol-powered 7 Series, and a massive 110 litres less than you get in the Mercedes EQS’ boot. The EQS is also a fastback, with a liftback-style tailgate making it more versatile than the saloon-style i7. There is at least a useful under-floor storage space which is big enough for you to be able to stash your charging cables, and the opening for the boot is big and wide, but there’s no ‘frunk’ boot in the front — in spite of how huge the bonnet is — and nor do the back seats fold flat to open up extra loading space. You do get tie-down points and shopping hooks, and the i7’s quality feel extends even into the boot, with a thick, luxurious carpet covering everything. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories The i7’s cabin is hugely luxurious and full of high-tech features, but not all of them are as clever as they seem The i7’s cabin steps ahead of that of the Mercedes EQS, mostly because it uses nicer materials and has a sense of higher quality about it. That’s true of the deep-pile carpets on the floor, which are almost like those of a Rolls-Royce , and the soft leather on the seats, which can be optionally replaced by a ‘vegan’ leather option if you like. The dashboard uses the big curved digital display that we’ve already seen in the iX electric SUV and which runs on the eighth generation of BMW’s ‘iDrive’ software. It’s all very advanced, and features items such as ‘augmented reality’ — which overlays direction arrows for the sat nav onto a live feed taken from the front-facing camera — and an optional 2,000-watt Bowers & Wilkins stereo which comes with ‘exciter’ bass speakers mounted in the backs of the seats. There’s a lot of crystal-effect buttons and trim in the i7, which you might find either tacky or delightful, and the full-width crystal strip on the dashboard (it’s actually made of plastic) lights up depending on what functions you’re using, as well as being part of the background mood lighting. Even the glass roof gets in on the act, as it can be inlaid with strips of LED lights which act as part of the cabin mood lighting. The star of the show, though, is the optional 31.0-inch screen which folds down from the roof and which turns the back seats into a mobile cinema or video game arcade. It’s a touchscreen, but it also runs on 8K high-definition picture quality and there’s a built-in Amazon Fire Stick to allow those in the back to watch movies or TV shows, or you could plug in a games console. It does entirely remove any rearward vision for the driver, though and the controls are more fiddly to use than they really ought to be. That’s true of the controls on the big infotainment screen in the front, too. BMW has unwisely put all of the heating and ventilation controls on the screen, and there are so many adjustable items that you actually have to scroll the screen sideways so that the driver and front seat passenger can access all of the available options. Equally, BMW has moved controls for the active cruise control from the steering wheel to the screen, which makes items such as the radar-guided distance control (which keeps you a safe distance from the car in front on the motorway) far too awkward to access. Those in the back get handy little smartphone-like control panels built into the rear doors, which allows them to adjust their seats, open and close sunblinds, and operate some of the big TV functions. We do like the exceptional quality levels though, and the fit and finish is hard to fault. There are also very nice touches such as front air vents that are hidden within the dash design, and which are controlled by subtle little buttons which don’t break up the lines of the cabin. There’s a ‘soft-close’ function for the doors as standard — no need to slam them shut — and you can optionally have fully electric doors which open and close at the press of a button. One amusing touch are the ‘Iconic Sounds’ — electronic noises meant to replace the traditional sounds of an engine, and which BMW has had made by legendary Hollywood music composer Hans Zimmer (Gladiator, Inception, and so many more). They’re a little odd, but quite good fun. Electric range, charging and tax Electric range, charging and tax The i7 uses a big, but surprisingly slim-fitting, 102kWh battery pack, which gives it an official range on one charge between 334 and 387 miles, depending on the model. That would be impressive, but the Mercedes EQS has a slightly bigger battery and can hit a claimed 441 miles on one charge. The i7 will struggle to hit that official maximum range too, especially if you’re doing any motorway miles. We conducted one of our range tests with the i7 and found on a mainly motorway run it managed 303 miles before the battery was completely drained. On the upside, the i7 can charge at up to 22kW on AC power, such as from a kerb-side charging point, with a full 22kW charge taking just over six hours, says BMW. You can get 195kW charging from more powerful DC public chargers, which can add as much as 106 miles of extra range in just 10 minutes. As an electric car, the i7 is still zero-rated for VED car tax , and you’ll pay just two per cent in BIK tax if you’re a company car buyer. Safety and security Safety and security The i7 hasn’t been tested by Euro NCAP yet, but the iX SUV — which shares some of the i7’s parts and construction — received a full five-star rating. As standard, the i7 comes with four-wheel drive, traction control (which includes BMW’s ‘near-actuator’ system which speeds up response to a slipping wheel), stability control, radar-guided cruise control, forward collision alert and emergency braking, lane-keeping steering, all-round cameras and parking sensors, speed limit assistance, and ‘evasion assistance’ for the steering which can help you swerve around obstacles. There’s also a blind-spot monitor, rear cross traffic alert, and a system that warns you if you’re about to open your door when a cyclist is coming up in your blind spot. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems The i7 is too new for us to have a solid handle on how reliable it will be, although BMW’s reliability rating has been improving of late — although it’s not quite as impressive as you might think, and the likes of Lexus and Genesis are well ahead in reliability terms. BMW does offer a standard three-year unlimited mileage warranty, and the i7’s battery pack is covered for eight years or 100,000 miles."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/6-series-convertible,BMW 6 Series Convertible Review and Prices,"€89,798",6/10,new,"If you’re looking for a luxurious open-top that’s more relaxing than, say, a Porsche 911 Cabriolet, the BMW 6 Series Convertible is well worth considering. It’s enjoyable to drive, has a choice of strong performing, efficient engines and a well-equipped interior. Indeed, there are very few complaints about the 6 Series’ interior. The dashboard is angled towards the driver and the quality of materials is of a very high standard. Everything feels opulent, if maybe just a little bland, given the hefty price tag. Still, BMW’s easy-to-use iDrive infotainment system comes as standard. The BMW 6 Series’ front seats are comfortable, though, and with the roof down it remains an incredibly quiet and unruffled place to sit – there’s no raising of voices needed here. The rear seats are less impressive for adults, who’ll struggle for knee room. The fabric roof can be raised or lowered at speeds up to 19mph and four adults are well protected from the wind even at higher speeds. A decent amount of luggage can come along for the road too – the 6’s boot will take a large suitcase plus some soft bags, a large pushchair or a set of golf clubs without fuss. There are three engines to choose from, but they’re all excellent. The entry-level petrol comes in the shape of the 3.0-litre turbocharged inline-six in the slightly confusingly titled 640i. Producing 320hp, it’s a smooth performer, mellow in sound, but strong enough to overtake with confidence. It’s best to enjoy the BMW 6 Series Convertible for what it does best: cruising in the sun, roof down. If you want sports-car fun, there are better open-tops. The twin-turbo V8 650i petrol adds a little extra power, but only improves on the performance figures marginally, at the expense of almost 9mpg in fuel economy. If efficiency is a bigger priority, then the 640d – a 3.0-litre diesel producing 313hp – will be more your thing. Hardly any less powerful than the 640i petrol it’ll also manage 40mpg if driven sensibly. Its all-round ability makes it the best option for the 6 Series. All 6-Series use BMW’s slick eight-speed automatic gearbox. It shifts smoothly, rarely gets caught out and generally suits the relaxed vibe of the car very well. Convertible cars sometimes suffer from shudder where the body flexes when cornering hard or going over bumps. No such problems here – the 6-Series feels solid, but not at the expense of the driving experience. It feels nimble, too, with high levels of grip. Still, it stops short of an all-out sports car, lacking the sort of connection you’ll enjoy in a 911 Cabriolet. Comfort, Normal and Sport driving modes are available on the 6 Series, but it’s best to leave it in Comfort or Normal, as switching to Sport causes the 6 to feel unsettled without managing to achieve any noticeable improvement to how it goes around corners. So, if you’re a keen driver then there are better ways to get your kicks. But, if you rarely carry rear passengers and cruising with the wind in your hair is more your thing, then the BMW 6 Series Convertible will do a fine job. Just bear in mind that these days there are many newer alternatives with the latest tech to consider – most notably BMW’s own 8 Series Convertible."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/m5-touring,BMW M5 Touring Review & Prices,"€143,869",8/10,new,"Is the BMW M5 Touring a good car? Is the BMW M5 Touring a good car? The combination of ‘M5’ and ‘Touring’ is legendary in performance car circles, because BMW has only applied the estate car treatment to three generations of the M5 super-saloon since it was launched in 1984. And yes, that includes the latest G90 model M5. The new G99 generation M5 Touring manages to be both a sledgehammer and a scalpel. It appears unwieldy, with its immense size and power, yet it’s shockingly precise and easy to use - though it can still get you into trouble if you’re not careful. While it has lost its supercar-style, high-revving, naturally aspirated engine over the years, the latest M5 features a frankly absurd 727hp, twin-turbocharged, 4.4-litre V8 hybrid engine under the bonnet. 0-62mph is dispatched in just 3.6 seconds, 0.1 seconds slower than the M5 saloon , but considering the Touring weighs more than an X5 M Competition SUV …or a small moon…that’s still some going. On the subject of super-SUVs, it’s not just the likes of the Audi RS6 Avant and Mercedes-AMG E53 Estate that you might cross-shop the M5 Touring with; there’s a huge variety of high-performance, high-practicality alternatives on sale. The Porsche Cayenne Turbo, Taycan Sport Turismo and the Range Rover Sport SV all offer a combination of rapid pace and dog-friendly boot space, for example. The M5 Touring is an enormous car, the same size as a 7 Series was not too long ago, with some outlandish styling features such as the oversized, light-up grille and bulging wheel arches. The LED headlights look almost too small and the rear diffuser too big, but there’s no denying that the M5 is aggressive through and through - and the Touring’s design is far more coherent than the saloon’s. Inside is much like a standard 5 Series though, with only the small flash of M-ness to remind you of what you’re driving. There’s a strip of red at the top of the steering wheel and red accents on the shift paddles and start button, and a pair of delightful M5-specific seats at the front, but aside from that you may as well be sitting in a 520i. That’s no bad thing considering BMW’s swish curved touchscreen setup and high material quality, but the infotainment is a bit of a faff to navigate with all of its menus, sub-menus and a lack of physical buttons. There’s plenty of room inside for all passengers, and a pair of wireless phone charging pads under the touchscreen are useful, but with your phone in situ there’s not that much storage space in the M5’s cabin. The door pockets are a decent size, but the centre console cubby is rather shallow, and it’s frustrating having to use the cupholders to store odds and sods in. Boot space is down when compared to every other 5 Series Touring on sale - including the electric i5 model - at only 500 litres. Something has to give when squeezing a hybrid battery and electronic differential into a family car, and in this case it’s the depth of the cargo area. There’s an optional electronically retractable tow bar and a 2000kg towing weight, should you be inclined to tow your classic E30 M3 race car about, for example. The M5 has lost none of its performance prowess in the name of practicality. Never mind the 0-62mph time, it’s the way in which the M5 hides its weight on a country road which amazes. With a slew of adaptive drive settings for the engine, gearbox, suspension and even brakes, you can set the M5 up to suit your driving style and have a whale of a time when the going gets twisty. Motorways are serene as it glides at high speeds in its softest settings, but it does feel stiff over broken city roads. The M5 avoids feeling crashy through potholes, but you can tell it’s a performance car by the way it’s shaken about in dips and over bumps. Check out the best BMW M5 Touring deals on Carwow, or the latest BMW M5 Touring lease deals for an alternative way to get the rapid family wagon on your driveway. You can have a look at used BMW M5 Tourings from our network of trusted dealers, or browse other used BMWs . Carwow can even help you sell your car when the time comes to change, taking the hassle out of the process. How much is the BMW M5 Touring? How much is the BMW M5 Touring? The M5 Touring’s price tag starts at over £110,000, which is a huge amount of money until you realise that the M5’s closest alternative in the Audi RS6, which is less technologically advanced, also starts at around the same price - without the ability to drive around town on electric power alone. While it does come with a good amount of standard kit, as it should considering its price, it’s easy to push the M5 Touring’s price up substantially by ticking just a few option boxes. The Ultimate Pack, for example, costs around the same as a small hatchback. It’s easy to spec a car up to the nines when spending this much money, but considering the BMW M3 Touring offers much of the same performance and comfort for tens of thousands of pounds less, you’ve got to really want an M5 to get behind the wheel. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort Comfortable in town and rapid on the lanes, but there’s no escaping the M5’s enormous size BMW has managed to make the M5 Touring no more difficult to drive around town than a run-of-the mill 5 Series, which is a mighty impressive feat. The driving position is fantastic and the M5-specific seats are hugely supportive with plenty of adjustability, and in its softest setting the M5’s suspension does a remarkable job of ironing out battered roads at low speeds. That’s not to say it’s perfectly smooth, as bumpy roads can shake the M5 around a little. No matter how good the suspension is, there’s no hiding the fact that it’s a car set up for performance with stiffer springs than on a regular 5 Series. It’s noticeable on the Touring as there’s less isolation from the rear suspension, but large potholes do cause an audible suspension thud which you can hear from the back of the car. The biggest benefit of the hybrid drive system is that it has a useable real-world range of around 30 miles if you’re gentle, and under electric power the M5 Touring is a very relaxing car to drive. Motorways are a delight in the M5, as its prodigious power output makes getting up to speed a piece of cake. You can get up to cruising speed on electric power alone at a decent rate without having to use the engine, but when you do decide to overtake then the M5 will oblige with no hesitation. In its softest settings the M5 Touring is no harder to drive than a 5 Series with its engine barely ticking along to keep you going. It’s a shame for adaptive cruise control to be an optional extra on a car this expensive, especially as it’s a great system which will comfortably keep distance and change lanes for you. The estate body shape of the M5 Touring means there’s a little more road noise than in the saloon, with its enormous rear tyres humming into the cabin. It’s not intrusive, but the tyre roar is a little noticeable if you’re not listening to loud music. A powerful engine and practical cabin wouldn’t be enough for the Touring to live up to the M5 badge, but fortunately the latest model can handle itself on a B-road blast. When we tested the saloon with professional measuring equipment, it produced a monstrous 774hp - little wonder that the M5 pins you back into your seat with a 0-62mph time of 3.6 seconds. You wouldn’t believe that you’re piloting a two-and-a-half tonne battleship, as the geniuses at BMW M have fettled the suspension and programmed the M5’s computers to hide the big estate car’s weight. It corners flat with almost no body roll, and you’ll even feel the car rotate around you with the right settings ticked, but the M5’s cornering ability is more impressive than it is immersive. On our narrow country lanes, you can’t help shake the feeling that you’ve got no breathing room in the almost two-metre wide BMW; if someone comes around a blind corner a little in your lane then the hedgerow to your left will feel as though it’s in the passenger seat. In its softest suspension mode the M5 can bottom out on a rutted road at speed, or in its stiffest settings it gets shaken about aggressively, and the M5 Touring just isn’t as fun as some of its more fleet-footed alternatives. And you shouldn’t need a menu shortcut to navigate the iDrive and choose from an overwhelming selection of settings to tailor the M5 to your driving style. Yes, there’s a programmable ‘M’ button on the steering wheel you can save your settings to, but it’s all a bit…much, even if it is a devastatingly fast car to drive. Space and practicality Space and practicality The Touring is definitely the most practical M5 variant, but its boot isn’t that much bigger than in the saloon Up front, the M5’s cabin is great for long distance drives. The standard-fit sports seats are figure hugging and supportive without being too constrictive for those with a larger build, but the shoulder bolsters do crease very easily. We found marks in the leather on a car with just 1500 miles on the clock, which were especially noticeable in the ‘Sakhir Orange’ leather finish. You can’t sit low down in the M5 as a result of the underfloor battery packs, meaning the seating position is never quite as sporty as you’d hope for in a super-saloon. Even in the lowest position possible you’ll find yourself at eye-level with small SUV drivers - and your elbows will bash up against the chunky centre console and arm rest on the door. Big door bins, a small centre console cubby, a pair of cupholders and two wireless charging pads add a little convenience to the M5’s expanse of interior space making it an easy car to live with. The Mercedes-AMG E53 Estate and Audi RS6 Avant have the big BMW beat for leg room, but that doesn’t mean the M5 is anything less than capacious in the back. The cabin feels airy, even with the front sports seats’ wide shoulder bolsters, especially with the glass roof option ticked. There’s enough shoulder room for three adults to sit in the back comfortably on shorter drives, or if you’re four-up on a long journey then a pair of USB-C chargers and a flip-down armrest with cupholders will keep your rear occupants comfortable and entertained. The door bins are large enough for a couple of water bottles per passenger too. With a 500-litre boot capacity, the BMW M5 Touring sits firmly in the middle between its two closest alternatives: the Audi RS6 Avant at 545 litres and the Mercedes E53 Estate at 460 litres. The regular 5-Series has a slightly larger 520-litre boot - you lose 20 litres to fit the M5’s larger differential in - and while it’s a usefully square shape the M5 has two bulges in the boot floor which intrude when loading wider objects. Though if you don’t need as much space up front, the BMW M3 Touring offers just as much boot space, and almost as much performance, in a smaller and cheaper package. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories Solid build quality and clever tech aplenty, but previous M5s have felt more special inside There’s not a great deal separating the M5 Touring from any other 5 Series, but the changes are very much driver-focused. Again, the excellent sports seats are the biggest difference, but smaller details such as a new flat-bottom steering wheel and some small red flashes around the cabin mark out the M5 as the top-of-the-range model. The steering wheel buttons and paddle-shifters on the steering wheel aren’t as ‘clicky’ to use as you’d hope for, but on the flipside the configurable ‘M’ buttons on the wheel do add some extra sportiness. While the enormous wide-screen displays are pretty to look at with razor-sharp graphics and a nifty digital M5 that mimics your lights and steering input on screen, there’s just too many menus, sub-menus and settings to choose from for the infotainment to be intuitive to use. Fortunately BMW has retained the rotary controller for the infotainment system, but once again you still need to battle through a myriad of menus which can be distracting on the move. You can program in shortcuts on a swipe-down menu on the main display, but the screen is so wide that it takes real concentration to select options on the side furthest away from you. The big light-up trims around the cabin are a bit tacky, especially when selected in the BMW M colour-scheme which floods the interior with red and blue light. Less lounge bar, more kebab shop…or police car. MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax The BMW M5’s split-personality extends beyond its driving manners to its fuel efficiency, and depending on how you drive the M5 Touring can be very economical or very, very thirsty. Drivers with a lead foot and a propensity to carve through corners won’t see more than 10mpg and frequent trips to the petrol station. If you do most of your miles in town or on a gentle commute and have access to a charger, then the M5 Touring’s electric range means that you might barely see a petrol station. The biggest advantage of the M5 is that it produces low CO2 emissions, avoiding the worst first-year tax hit and falling into the 8% benefit-in-kind company car tax bracket. If you’re a CEO or company director looking for a high-performance family car, the M5 touring will cost you less than most of its alternatives. Safety and security Safety and security The M5 Touring takes its crash safety rating from the regular 5 Series saloon, with which its body is near-identical under the skin. The 5 Series earned a full five-star rating in Euro NCAP crash testing, with an 89% score for adult occupant safety and 85% for child occupants - great news for families with children. Equally impressive is its 86% score for vulnerable road user (pedestrian) safety. A comprehensive camera and sensor array around the M5 Touring helps when parking and makes for reliable lane-keep assist , but it’s a shame that some of the safety features BMW has developed are optional - especially the active cruise control . Reliability and problems Reliability and problems With an enormously powerful engine and hi-tech electronic systems, the M5 is bound to be less reliable than a typical car with a small petrol engine. Being such a niche model, BMW doesn’t sell enough M5s to get a broad idea of the real world reliability data, but in theory it should be as reliable as any other 5 Series. BMW ranked 14th out of 32 manufacturers in the 2024 Driver Power survey, placing it just about in the top half. While that may not sound that impressive, it was far ahead of Mercedes and Audi in 25th and 27th places respectively, so the M5 Touring should offer more peace of mind than its German alternatives. BMW offers a three-year, unlimited-mile warranty which is more competitive than its closest alternatives. Just make sure you don’t miss a service interval, especially the crucial first service, and it’s likely worth opting for the extended warranty for additional peace of mind.

The large and boxy Peugeot e-Traveller can’t hide its van origins on the outside, but its interior looks and feels much like a contemporary family car. With the added benefit of tons of space and plenty of configurability. You can decide on the number and layout of the seats as well as standard and long wheelbase versions. This is essentially a customisable chest of drawers with wheels. All versions are powered by a 134bhp electric motor paired to a 50kWh battery pack. There are three driving modes (Eco, Normal and Power), each progressively increasing the available power output. A range of 148 miles is claimed on the WLTP cycle, with a charge from 0-80% taking 30-minutes using a 100kW fast charger. An 11kW wallbox will do the job in 5 hours. If you’re in a tight spot and need to charge from a domestic wall socket, it will take 31 hours to get from 0-100%. It's the same as the Citroen e-SpaceTourer and Vauxhall Vivaro Life Electric , which are almost identical bar the front-end styling. The two trims on offer are called Business and Business VIP, a subtle hint at what Peugeot expects most e-Travellers will be used for. That doesn’t preclude it from being a rather practical family vehicle though, especially since you can seat between four to nine occupants based on the seat layout. Both trims can be had in standard and long wheelbase versions. The base trim comes with manual air conditioning, rear parking sensors, cloth seats and 17-inch black steel wheels. Business VIP adds several useful extras like keyless entry, hands free electric sliding rear doors and sat nav. An optional safety pack adds driver aids like adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning and automatic emergency braking. Interior space is cavernous, with up to 1,162 litres of boot space available on long wheelbase models even with nine seats in place. With five seats in place, you can pack in 3,000-litres of cargo (4,900-litres with both rear rows removed). The huge rear tailgate and low load lip make it easier to load bulky and heavy items.

https://www.carwow.co.uk/peugeot/208-gti,Peugeot 208 GTi Review and Prices,"€19,293",8/10,new,"The Peugeot 208 GTi is the successor to one of the greatest hot hatches ever, the 205 GTi. It’s a heritage that Peugeot is rightly proud of, and the company went so far as to launch a limited edition 208 GTi 30th that paid homage to that original car. Of course, today’s 208 is very different to that 205, but what hasn’t changed in the last 30 years is that the market for hot hatches is fiercely contested and the Peugeot 208 GTi is an alternative to fine cars such as the Ford Fiesta ST and Volkswagen Polo GTi. Even from the outside, the bodykit, badges and red details make it obvious that this is no ordinary 208 and the theme continues inside. Here, you’ll find a strictly red and black colour scheme, with red flashes on the door pulls, air vent surrounds, seat stitching, and on the side of the gear knob. There are GTi badges all over the place, too, as well as a rally-inspired red strip on the top of the steering wheel so that it’s easy to see when you’re pointing straight ahead. Unfortunately, that steering wheel is the main point of contention inside the Peugeot 208 GTi – as it is in any 208. The wheel is unusually small, and deliberately set low so that the driver looks at the dials over the top of the rim, rather than through the wheel. Some people love it, but others just can’t get on with it. So, it’s something to consider if you’re in the market for a car like this, because whether you like it is very much down to personal taste. One thing that everyone can agree on is the Peugeot 208 GTi’s sporty yet comfortable ride. On a bumpy road, where rivals like the Fiesta ST can feel just too firm and bounce around when you’re driving fast, the Peugeot feels under more control more of the time. You can attack corners with complete confidence and, in the right hands on a twisty road, this talented little car is more than capable of surprising much more powerful cars. Exactly how a hot hatch should be, then. I can remember the original 205 GTi and the 208 GTi isn’t as good as that, but it’s the first Peugeot hot hatch I’ve liked so much in a long time Behind that performance is a 205hp 1.6-litre turbocharged engine co-developed with BMW that will get this pocket rocket to 60mph in just over six seconds. It’s even claimed to return more than 50mpg, according to Peugeot – assuming you can drive it like a saint. If you can’t do that, you can at least be happy that the GTi comes with a decent amount of equipment, including 17-inch alloy wheels and sparkling LED daytime running lights. Inside, meanwhile, there’s a DAB radio and dual-zone climate control, plus automatic headlights and wipers. Sports seats keep you in place in fast corners and there’s GTi-specific red lighting for the dial surrounds. So far, so good, but the problem for anyone considering a 208 GTi is the Ford Fiesta ST. Not only is it cheaper to buy, it’s also even better to drive. Nevertheless, the Peugeot is a still a very good hot hatch that you could happily drive every day. It may not quite recapture the magic of the 205, but it is by far the best hot hatch that Peugeot has produced in recent memory"
https://www.carwow.co.uk/peugeot/e-rifter,Peugeot e-Rifter Review & Prices,"€39,895",5/10,new,"Is the Peugeot e-Rifter a good car? Is the Peugeot e-Rifter a good car? If you’re in the market for a family MPV with an all-electric powertrain and loads of interior space, the Peugeot e-Rifter may be the car you’re after. While it might not be the most enticing-looking thing, it has all the attributes for those who need to lug things or people around regularly. As long as it’s within a reasonably short distance. The e-Rifter is a bit like a lightweight Cesna aircraft. Sure it’s great at shorter distances and very good at that. But you’ll be making plenty of stops if you want to go on any long-distance trips. It shares underpinnings with the Citroen e-Berlingo and Vauxhall Combo Life Electric , so if it looks familiar that could be why. Unlike the VW ID Buzz , which is a style icon, the e-Rifter ranks among the more reserved offerings. It’s slab-sided and won’t be winning any design awards, but has a smart face that will be pleasing to some. The cabin also isn’t the most exciting, but it has got either blue or orange sections to brighten up the otherwise black and grey finish. You get Peugeot’s funky iCockpit setup, while there are loads of storage bins and cubbies to hold your things, which makes for a very practical cabin. Rear space is also pretty good, while the boot is well-sized, although you’ll have to contend with a large tailgate, so make sure you don’t park too close to anything at the back. It’s not the nicest-feeling cabin though, as durability is the keyword with the e-Rifter. Scratchy plastics cover a lot of the surfaces, while the compact steering wheel is only leather-covered in the GT version. As with the cabin, the drive system is pretty underwhelming. You get a 50kWh battery pack paired to a front-mounted electric motor – and that’s on both the standard or long-wheelbase version. But on both, the official range of 172 miles isn’t likely to be enough for most families – especially if longer journeys are likely to be part of the mix. On such lengthier runs, efficiency isn’t great. Being boxy in shape, the e-Rifter doesn’t cut through the air very well, so you get a lot of wind noise. You also run through your battery quickly, and we found you’re more likely to go not much further than 100 miles on motorway drives. The e-Rifter is better suited to life off the motorway. With its lighter steering and large windows all-around, you have good credentials for town family runaround. The electric motor gets you up to speed quickly enough, while the option of regenerative braking to recoup charge helps negotiate slower moving traffic – although the car won’t come to a stop on its own due to the lack of a one-pedal drive mode. Vans aren’t great to drive on twistier roads, and the e-Rifter conforms to that stereotype. It feels cumbersome as the electric motor is only just powerful enough, but it doesn’t lean too much in bends as the batteries are mounted in the floor to help with stability. While it may have some major drawbacks, the Peugeot e-Rifter is better suited to people needing a large car for around town and who don’t need to venture too far from home with it. It also isn’t too pricey, especially against the Volkswagen ID. Buzz . Plus it has the option of seven seats – a rare asset among smaller EVs. And if you want to get a great deal on the e-Rifter , check out carwow, where you can also browse offers on the latest Peugeot models as well. If you want to see what used Peugeots are around, carwow has that too, and if you’re looking to change your car, our sell my car service will help you get a great price. How much is the Peugeot e-Rifter? How much is the Peugeot e-Rifter? While not the most expensive family car around, the e-Rifter is the most expensive out of the triplets from the same bloodline; the Citroen e-Berlingo and Vauxhall Combo Life Electric both start at a lower price. Compared to other electric family cars, like the Skoda Enyaq , Mercedes EQB and Volkswagen ID Buzz , the e-Rifter is significantly cheaper though. But you will have to compromise on range and quality of finish. There are also some options you can add to boost the overall appeal. All cost less than £1,000 each, but the cheaper credentials go out of the window if you start ticking away at the options list, at which point cars like the Skoda Enyaq could come into play. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort While the steering weight is light, making for easy progress around town, the rest of the e-Rifter experience is pretty underwhelming This is where the e-Rifter makes a lot of sense. Possibly not in its long wheelbase layout as much, but it manages to be simple to manoeuvre around town thanks to feather-light steering and large windows. The 10.8-metre turning circle is rather handy too, meaning that even in the longer XL model, you have decent manoeuvrability, and the big glass areas make for good visibility. With the instant performance offered by the electric motor, you can get away from junctions pretty swiftly. It runs out of puff quite soon though. That instant punch makes getting away from traffic lights easy, but it’s definitely suited for town driving. As the e-Rifter isn’t too dissimilar in shape to a brick, efficiency at high speed isn’t that great. Built to be a petrol/diesel-powered MPV originally, the electric power isn’t that punchy once you get out of town and at motorway speeds you end up burning through the battery pretty quickly. Combine that with driving in winter and you’re likely to see the range at less than 100 miles, which is quite anxiety-inducing on a longer journey. That means you’re averaging around 2.0 miles per kWh – nowhere near good enough for long-range driving. Even when driving calmly and in milder weather, you’re unlikely to go more than 120 miles between charges, so be prepared for lots of time sitting at charging stations if you regularly stray far from home. The e-Rifter is by no means a sporty car. The lighter steering that’s great in town makes the Peugeot feel a bit out of its depth when you’re hustling it on a twistier road. But that’s just not what this car is built for. You can engage Sport mode to stiffen up the steering and suspension slightly, but you’re better off taking your time and leaving it in normal mode. That way, you can be more comfortable doing it. You can hear the bumps rattle through the cabin when you go over them, while there’s plenty of wind and tyre noise when you get up to higher speeds. It definitely isn’t the most relaxing car to drive on a longer run. Space and practicality Space and practicality There’s lots of space throughout for passengers and storage, but just remember that the tailgate is huge so needs a decent space to open Where the e-Rifter majors is in space for both passengers and storage. There are some let downs in the front, with the door bins not being the largest, but you get space back with a huge cavern in the centre console. That does mean your cupholders are in an odd place – you get one to the right of the steering wheel, and the other in front of the passenger. There’s an additional glovebox on the top of the dashboard, while you get a full-width shelf above the windscreen for further storage. You sit quite high for a decent view out and there is a decent level of adjustment, but some will find the small steering wheel that’s part of Peugeot’s iCockpit setup a little strange. You do get reach and angle adjustment for that though so you can find a comfortable seating position. Rear space is rather good. With its van-based origins, the e-Rifter has loads of head and legroom, and with no transmission tunnel, three people will be able to sit across the back row comfortably. Getting in there is also pretty simple. You get sliding rear doors, which means getting in and out in tighter parking spaces can be very easy. Just make sure that they’re fully open, as they can close quite quickly and surprisingly if not. You get folding tray tables on the back of the front seats, which are a little flimsy, while the door bins aren’t too big either. You can add two further seats in the rear to help move more people around, and these are removable to make for more storage space instead. That does mean finding a place to put them though. Being van-shaped, the e-Rifter has decent storage available. In the standard form, you get 1,355 litres up to the roof, while going for the Long version tots up at 1,900 litres with the rearmost seats removed. Folding the rearmost seats (and taking out the two rear seats in the seven-seater) down takes that up to 3,000 litres for the standard version, while the long wheelbase option gets 3,500 litres to work with. It’s a very square space that helps with taking plenty of things around easily, while the lip is quite low – making loading a lot easier. But one annoyance is the liftgate boot opening. That helps loading things, but in tighter spaces that can be quite impractical. Alternatives like the Volkswagen ID. Buzz (1,100 litres) and Mercedes EQV (1,410 litres) do offer more space, but both are considerably more expensive. The Citroen e-Berlingo and Vauxhall Combo Life Electric both offer the same space as they are built on the same underpinnngs. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories There’s some funky shapes across the dashboard with the iCockpit layout, but the materials used aren’t the finest With the iCockpit concept, you get a pretty cool layout for a family MPV. You get a funky leather steering wheel – albeit on the small side – and well-shaped instrument panel that holds the driver’s display that’s 10.0-inch on the top-spec car. In the entry Allure model, you get analogue dials and a smaller screen. Depending on which trim you go for, you can have either a brown (GT) or blue (Allure) finish to pair with the black plastic you get throughout most of the interior. It’s not the nicest-feeling material with it being quite scratchy, while the upholstery on the seats is nice enough, but definitely made for a hard-wearing life. Durable hard plastics can be found on a lot of other surfaces, like the door bins and around the centre console. You get an 8.0-inch touchscreen infotainment system that’s mounted on the dashboard surrounded by piano black plastic, which can easily attract grubby fingerprints. The system itself isn’t the best, being laggy and a little difficult to navigate. You can connect via either Android Auto and Apple CarPlay , which are both definitely more user-friendly. You can choose to add 11kW AC charging instead of the standard 7kW setup for a faster home charge, as well as an upgraded alarm system. You can also add keyless entry, a pack with rear parking sensors and a reversing camera, and GT versions will get blind spot detection, front parking sensors and park assist. Electric range, charging and tax Electric range, charging and tax All versions of the e-Rifter get a 50kWh battery pack, which is good for 172 miles on a full charge. That goes for both the standard and Long version. On a DC charger, you can go up to 100kW in terms of charging speed, while AC charging is 7kW as standard. You can choose to upgrade that to 11kW. On fast charging you can go from 10-80% in 26 minutes, while doing a full charge on AC takes seven and a half hours. To get the max range from the battery, you need to average 3.4mi/kWh. But you won’t get anywhere near that figure if you’re spending much time on faster toads with higher speeds. As it costs less than £40,000, you won’t have to pay VED at all. But from April 2024, electric cars will need to be paying tax. Safety and security Safety and security You get a decent amount of safety kit as standard. There’s lane keep assist, active safety braking, traffic sign recognition, speed limit recognition, cruise control and driver attention monitoring. You can only add blind spot monitoring, front parking sensors and park assist to the top GT models. As mentioned before you can add an improved alarm system, approved by Thatcham, while you get airbags throughout, ISOFIX points for child seats and disc brakes on both the front and rear axle. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems Peugeots have had a reputation of poor reliability, but in recent years that has been improving. Previous versions of the standard Rifter have had some recalls for issues with the steering rack and underbody protection, but the e-Rifter has currently been unscathed. All Peugeot models come with a three-year/60,000-mile warranty, while the e-Rifter – being an EV – gets an eight-year warranty for the battery pack. You can choose to purchase an extended warranty from Peugeot, as long as the car is less than 10 years old and has done under 100,000 miles."

The Peugeot 5008 is the bigger, seven-seat sibling of the Peugeot 3008 . It has the same underpinnings as that car - same engines, hybrid systems, and even most of the same interior. But it’s larger, with more space in the cabin and a much bigger boot. It’s like swapping jackets for one that looks the same but has massive hidden pockets. We like it so much the Peugeot 5008 received a Highly Commended award in the Family Values category at the 2025 Carwow Car of the Year Awards . It certainly cuts a rug, and makes a stylish alternative to the likes of the Skoda Kodiaq , Hyundai Santa Fe and Nissan X-Trail . There is a fully electric Peugeot E-5008 , which we’ve reviewed separately, but this page will focus on the simpler and more affordable hybrid and plug-in hybrid models. At the front, the 5008 shares its style with the smaller 3008. There’s a huge body-coloured grille which stretches across the whole front of the car, flanked by LED daytime running lights which are meant to look as though a lion (Peugeot’s mascot) has slashed the front of the car with its claws. Though it’s not exactly pretty, the effect is striking and it stands out in a world of anonymous-looking family SUVs such as the Volkswagen Tiguan . Further back, the 5008 gets a much squarer roofline than the dramatically sloping 3008. It’s quite blocky, but that’s necessary to provide good headroom for the occupants of the third row of seats - and a bigger boot when it’s folded away. It certainly pays off, as the middle row of seats has way more space for heads, knees and feet than you get in the 3008. You also get three individual rear seats which split and fold in a 40:20:40 arrangement, making it much more flexible for balancing passengers and load space. The third row has space for adults for very short trips - though kids will be more comfortable back there. Even the 5008’s 348-litre boot (with all the seats up) is pretty reasonable, but with just five seats in place you get a mammoth 916 litres of space, which is bigger than the Hyundai Santa Fe or the Skoda Kodiaq. Front-seat passengers are well catered-for too, with a dashboard that goes hard on high-tech features. There’s a huge screen setup that stretches right across the top of the dash and covers off driver information and infotainment, plus a configurable panel of ‘i-Toggles’ which lets you set customisable shortcuts to almost any of the car’s functions. There’s no question that it looks good, even if the styling is a little busy, and it feels great too. The plastics are high quality and much of the dash is covered in fabric, giving it a softer, sofa-like feel that’s very luxurious. Engine options are both hybrid - there’s a 136hp 1.2-litre which sounds as though it’s going to be way too weedy, but actually copes well even with a fully-loaded car. If you’d prefer something a little more effortless, there’s a 196hp plug-in hybrid which can manage up to 48 miles of fully electric range and promises super-low fuel bills if you keep it topped up. Regardless of engine, the 5008 is comfortable to drive, though shelve any expectations you might have that this model has anything to do with the brand’s Peugeot Sport division. Despite the supportive seats and sporty steering wheel, the 5008 is not set up to be fun in the corners - instead, it’s easy and relaxing to drive. Get the best price on this new car with our best Peugeot 5008 deals . You can also check out other used Peugeot models, or find a used Peugeot 5008 for sale from our network of trusted dealers. Remember you can also sell your old car through Carwow too. How much is the Peugeot 5008? How much is the Peugeot 5008? The Peugeot 5008 is priced to compete with the Skoda Kodiaq at just under £38,000, and offers seven seats as standard where the most affordable Skoda has only five seats. Equally, the cheapest 5008 is the hybrid version, whereas the Kodiaq just gives you petrol power. The 5008 is also much, much more affordable than the Hyundai Santa Fe, but the Peugeot is a smaller car and doesn’t have quite as much boot space nor as much room in its third row of seats. The same goes for the Kia Sorento , which still offers a diesel engine unlike the 5008. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort Comfortable and easy to drive, but the standard hybrid engine can be noisy All Peugeot 5008s are automatic, so there’s no manual gearbox to worry about. However, the transmission can be a little reluctant to shift quickly, especially if you’re asking for lots of acceleration in a hurry - such as when you’re trying to move out quickly at a junction. In other hybrid cars, this is where the electric motor comes into play, but the Peugeot relies more on its petrol engine with the electric motor only cutting in at low speeds or when decelerating. A Toyota RAV4 certainly feels more responsive thanks to its more powerful and smoother electric motor. The Peugeot does have plenty of redeeming features around town, though. The steering is light and the tiny steering wheel is really easy to twirl around if you’re parking, for example. You also get great visibility out the front, while every model gets rear parking sensors and a reversing camera. Unlike the 3008, you also get a rear wiper. It’s pretty comfy over bumps too, even on the biggest 20-inch alloy wheels. You don’t bob about too much on rough surfaces and the 5008 doesn’t get upset by speed bumps. It’s softer than a Hyundai Santa Fe or a Skoda Kodiaq in this regard. Getting up to speed in the self-charging hybrid 5008 can be a slightly raucous affair as the engine needs working hard, especially when fully laden. However, the throaty sound of the three-cylinder petrol is rather nicer than the four-cylinder drone you get in a Hyundai Santa Fe, so it’s not all bad. Once you’re up to speed refinement is excellent with very well-contained wind, road and engine noise. With so much upholstery in the cabin it’s no wonder things don’t echo much. Peugeot’s assisted driving features work well, though you only get adaptive cruise control as standard on the upper trim level. Here the 5008’s soft suspension counts against it, as it just doesn’t feel as settled or as much fun as a Skoda Kodiaq or Hyundai Santa Fe. But does that matter? In a family-oriented car such as the 5008, what’s important is that it corners smartly with plenty of grip, and doesn’t lean so much in the bends that your occupants will get car sick. It’s actually very settled when it comes to hitting poor surfaces in the middle of a turn too, which is very reassuring. Space and practicality Space and practicality A useful boot space whether you’ve got five or seven seats up, but third-row occupants will be cosy The 5008 uses Peugeot’s distinctive ‘i-Cockpit’ arrangement. This means the steering wheel is smaller than normal, and you look at the dials over the top of it, rather than peering through the rim. For some drivers you may find that the lowest lines of information are blocked, or that the wheel feels like it’s uncomfortably close to being in your lap, so we’d recommend trying out a few driving positions on a decent-length test-drive to make sure you can get really comfortable. There’s plenty of adjustment in the seat and steering wheel to facilitate this, and the 5008 being quite a tall car means you can sit a bit more upright. Storage for small items up front is great. The door bins are lined with felt to stop things rattling about, and there’s a big storage box under the armrest with an air-conditioning vent - it’s no fridge box, but it will keep drinks a little cooler than normal on a hot day. There’s another big storage bin down one side of the dashboard, underneath a wireless smartphone charging pad, and the cupholders can take even a big bottle. All this makes up for a rather tiny glovebox. The middle row of seats are spacious, and they slide back and forward to allow you to balance out space with the third row - or the boot. Legroom and headroom are decent, though if you have three occupants, the cabin doesn’t feel particularly wide. It’s a shame too that you don’t get many extras, such as natty little tray tables on the seat backs - though you do get USB charging ports, door bins, air-conditioning controls and a fold-down centre armrest with cupholders. All three seats in this row are separate, too, though the old 5008 was even better in this regard - it had three proper-sized seats, each with ISOFIX child-seat mounting points. The new car only has two ISOFIX points, on the outer rear seats. As for the third row, you won’t want to spend loads of time back here if you’re an adult. Average-sized adults will just about fit for a short journey, especially if the middle row occupants slide their seats forward a little. It’s a much better fit for children or teens, and unlike the Hyundai Santa Fe you don’t get nice touches like proper cupholders or USB charge points. No complaints here. With all seven seats in place, the Peugeot 5008 gets 348 litres of space. That’s not a bad size at all for a seven-seater, and is about the same size as a Skoda Kodiaq with all seven seats in place. To put that into perspective, a Volkswagen Polo has a 351-litre boot - so the Peugeot has about as much space as a small hatchback when you’re carrying seven. Fold down the rearmost seats, though, and you get a cavernous 916-litre boot - bigger than a Skoda Kodiaq (780 litres for the seven-seater) a Hyundai Santa Fe (628 litres) or Nissan X-Trail (580 litres). The seats fold flat easily, and leave a nice unobstructed load bay, plus the boot opening is really big and square making it easy to load. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories A cool design and high-quality materials, but the infotainment system can be a bit laggy to use The 5008’s interior is unlike any other car on sale right now - well, except its smaller sibling the 3008, that is. It’s sort of a mixture between an airport lounge and an air traffic control tower - it’s both high-tech and plush at the same time. The top of the dash is dominated by what Peugeot says is a 21.0-inch display - it’s actually two separate screens under one piece of glass, but the effect is dramatic nonetheless. The one on the right has all your driver information such as speed and warnings, while the left is a touchscreen infotainment system. The infotainment looks good but isn’t the easiest to use - the software isn’t the snappiest, and some of the menus are confusing with just a few too many layers to them. Underneath the infotainment display you get a smaller letterbox-shaped screen which houses Peugeot’s ‘i-Toggles’ - customisable shortcuts that can be set to control just about anything. Set these up properly and you can make life in the 5008 much easier, with shortcuts to things like your preferred climate settings, specific sat-nav destinations or a quick way to turn off the more annoying driver assistance bongs. Everything inside feels high-quality too - the 5008 is a real challenger for the premium brands here, as even BMW would be impressed with the fit and finish. The fabric-covered dash feels lovely, and the switches have a reassuring soft click to them. Even smaller features - such as the solid-feeling column stalks or the whisper-quiet electric windows - help the feeling of luxury. MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax The most cost-effective 5008 to run is of course the all-electric E-5008 but the hybrid models shouldn’t break the bank either. Over a week with the self-charging hybrid we averaged around 48mpg, which is impressive for a car of this size and more than the Hyundai Santa Fe can manage. Expect this figure to go down if you’re fully laden or doing lots of town driving, though. The plug-in hybrid claims an unbelievable 212mpg. As with all PHEVs , your mileage may vary depending on what your journeys are like. If you plug in regularly and make the most of the 5008’s electric range (around 35-40 miles in the real world) then you might almost never have to use the petrol engine. Do lots of longer trips with a flat battery, and you’ll see worse economy than the regular hybrid. The plug-in model does have lower company car tax bills, though - it falls into the 8% BIK bracket. However, the Skoda Kodiaq scrapes into the 5% band thanks to its longer all-electric range. Safety and security Safety and security The 5008 hasn’t yet been tested by safety organisation Euro NCAP - the most recent Peugeots tested were the 408 and 308 in 2022, both of which scored four stars out of five. Standard safety kit is reasonable with the mandatory driver attention alert, lane-keeping aids, autonomous emergency braking as well as airbags in all three rows. The higher-spec GT model gets adaptive cruise control while blind-spot and rear cross traffic monitoring is available as an options pack. Peugeot makes turning off some of its more annoying beeps and bongs a bit irritating to do - you can set a shortcut on the i-Toggle display, but the best alternatives have a physical shortcut button for this. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems The 5008 is so new that it’s impossible to say for sure how reliable it’ll be. Both of its hybrid engines are recent additions to the range too, so there isn’t even historical data to go on for its engines. However, Peugeot placed an impressive sixth out of 32 car manufacturers in the latest Driver Power owner satisfaction survey, which is reassuring. Peugeot’s standard warranty is just three years, so the Hyundai Santa Fe’s five years or the Kia Sorento’s seven years of cover beat this - but you do get unlimited mileage in the first two years.

https://www.carwow.co.uk/peugeot/e-3008,Peugeot E-3008 Review & Prices,"€57,418",7/10,new,"Is the Peugeot E-3008 a good car? Is the Peugeot E-3008 a good car? The Peugeot E-3008 is one of the most distinctive-looking cars on the market today. While the latest generation has sacrificed some practicality for the sake of its swoopy looks, it’s a very accomplished family car under the skin. It’s like a pair of Ray-Ban sunglasses; still does the same job as a pair of petrol station specials, but it’s a bit posher and more interesting to look at. And again, as with a pair of designer sunglasses, there are other stylish alternatives to consider; the hybrid Renault Rafale , minimalist Tesla Model Y , retro-futuristic Hyundai Ioniq 5 and swoopy Volkswagen ID.5 to name a few. Though only the Ioniq 5 comes close to having as much road presence as the E-3008. It’s a fascinating mix of crisp angles, intricate details and big, bold surfaces. The roofline is oh-so rakish, and there’s even a little flick-up spoiler on the boot edge; Peugeot’s done a bang-up job with the styling. Range: 304 - 435 miles Efficiency: 4.2 - 4.5 miles per kWh Battery size: 73kWh, 97kWh Max charge speed: 160kW Charge time AC: 10hr 30mins, 0-100% at 7kW Charge time DC: 30 mins, 20-80% at 160kW Charge port location: Left side rear Power outputs: 210hp, 230hp, 320hp And the interior is just as impressive, looking as though it were designed with a ruler or a set square - in a good way - and there’s a clever use of fabric to mask harder plastics. The dashboard wraps around the driver, with a crisp 21.0-inch widescreen display housing both the infotainment and instrument cluster. Some thoughtful touches include a touchscreen shortcut bar under the middle air vents, and a secondary haptic climate control shortcut bar below it. While there’s standard Apple CarPlay / Android Auto connectivity, it is frustrating that you need to navigate away from them to adjust the climate settings. There’s plenty of room and adjustability to get comfortable in the front, even with Peugeot’s quirky small steering wheel, and rear passengers won’t feel hard done by for head space - even with the sloping roofline. Rear knee room is tight, but there’s a handy 520-litre boot capacity, though alternatives such as the Model Y and ID.5 have more cargo space. The E-3008 is rather efficient, with a claimed range of up to 435 miles depending on which trim and battery size you go for. You’ll likely see around 80% of that range in the real world, which isn’t bad going, but there is a hybrid 3008 available if you prefer petrol power. On the road, the E-3008 doesn’t quite match the precedent set by its sporty styling. It has tight, darty steering and a responsive throttle in sport mode, but it doesn’t feel all that comfortable being hustled down a country lane. It can feel unsettled with quick direction changes, and there’s almost zero feel from the brake pedal which is disconcerting. The dual-motor 325hp version feels more sure footed thanks to its four-wheel drive system, and it is quick, but it’s not quite the high-performance drive that Peugeot suggests it is. All versions are hugely comfortable though, soaking up bad roads with ease around town and sitting at a whisper-quiet cruise on the motorway - though the sharp steering can be a little jarring when making lane changes at high speeds. Still, the E-3008 is fantastic as a comfortable, stylish cruiser, and you can have a look at new E-3008 deals through Carwow. There are also E-3008 lease deals , and used Peugeot E-3008 deals through our trusted network of dealers. If you’re open to different body styles, there are other used Peugeots available, and Carwow can even help you sell your old car when you decide to make the jump. How much is the Peugeot E-3008? How much is the Peugeot E-3008? The E-3008 is significantly more expensive than its hybrid 3008 counterpart, and while its starting price may seem steep for a Peugeot, it’s actually on par with alternatives from Kia, Volkswagen and Tesla . There are only two trim levels to choose from: entry-level Allure and top-of-the-range GT. There aren’t many visual clues as to which is which, and even the base Allure cars are well equipped. LED lights, diamond-cut 19-inch alloy wheels, the widescreen dashboard display and a self-cleaning rear-view camera all come as standard on the E-3008. GT cars build on Allure models with a contrasting gloss black roof, more intricate light designs, heated front seats and some posh aluminium interior trims. They also get ever-so-slightly wider wheel arches in gloss black. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort It’s a stellar motorway cruiser and city crawler, but a sports car the E-3008 is not Driving around town is easy thanks to the light steering, and there’s enough punch to get you out of junctions sharpish. The Peugeot is easier to drive smoothly than alternatives such as the Tesla Model Y because of this, though, even in dual-motor guise. The E-3008 deals with large bumps and undulations in the road with little fuss, and while sharper edges such as potholes and expansion joints are more noticeable, they’re still not intrusive. Visibility is good looking forward and to the sides, though the shallow rear window isn’t all that easy to look out of when parking. To make manoeuvres easier you get a fantastic turning circle that almost rivals that of a London cab, as well as reversing sensors and a rear-facing camera as standard, with the latter getting a water spray so road grime doesn't block your view. Step up to GT models and you also get front parking sensors. At higher speeds the E-3008 is a fantastic car in which to cover long distances. The seats are comfortable and the car deals with road imperfections smoothly. There's almost no rumble from the tyres and minimal wind noise to contend with - particularly impressive with no engine noise to mask it. Although the motors don't feel particularly powerful at lower speeds, once you're on the move there's enough performance in reserve to get up to speed quickly. This is useful for short sliproads or when pulling off swift overtakes. The 325hp dual motor models make getting up to speed even easier, though if you’re not in sport mode it takes a couple of moments between putting your foot down and the rear motor kicking in to give you the extra boost. It is slightly disappointing given the E-3008's starting price that you only get regular cruise control as standard, with GT-spec cars getting an adaptive system that can maintain your distance to the car in front. On a country road the Peugeot E-3008 isn't the most stable drive, and while most bends are manageable and drama-free, tight hairpins and sharp direction changes do pronounce the E-3008’s body lean. It’s not a particularly fun car to drive though. In its normal settings, the steering is so light it can be difficult to judge your inputs and place the car accurately on the road, while the eco-friendly tyres can lose grip relatively quickly when pushed, especially in damp conditions. You can select the sport mode, which makes all of the car's power available all of the time, but it also makes the steering heavier, which feels unnatural and means you're exerting a lot of effort just to get the car turning. And you can't mix and match settings to your preference, either. As a result, the Tesla Model Y is much more fun on your favourite B-road. While the dual motor version has strong acceleration, stiffer suspension and dartier steering, it promises a sportier driving experience than it delivers. It’s the brakes which are the most disappointing, with almost no feel and a grabby nature to them; hard to meter because of how spongy they are. Space and practicality Space and practicality There’s plenty of storage in the cabin, but alternatives get a bigger boot There’s loads of space in the front of the Peugeot E-3008, and it’s easy to get a good driving position. The steering wheel doesn’t have much adjustability, but there’s so much movement in the seat that it doesn’t matter too much. And if you’ve struggled with the steering wheel blocking the view of the dials in other Peugeots, that's less of a problem than usual here, but it’s worth trying before you buy. There are plenty of clever storage solutions around the cabin. Both the front and rear door bins are big enough to store large bottles of water, but only the front ones have a felt lining. You also get a pair of cupholders, huge under-armrest storage that can be chilled, and another big space beneath a nicely damped cover under the screens. There are also a couple of USB slots for charging your devices. Those in the back won’t feel hard done by either, because there’s loads of room despite the sloping roof. Even taller passengers will find their knees won’t bang the seats in front and their hair won’t brush the headliner, though the floor is a bit high, which lifts your thighs off the seat cushion and could make things a little uncomfortable on long journeys. It’s a bit tight for three across the back and, with the outside passengers pushed towards the door, they will find their head resting on the roof. Storage isn’t quite as impressive as up front, but you do get a small area between the seats and door bins that will hold a small bottle. You also get a pair of USB slots and a 12-volt connector in the rear, great for charging phones and whatever device still has a 12-volt plug these days. On the plus side, all that space means it’s easy to fit a child seat, and the doors open pretty wide to help with access. The ISOFIX points are behind a zip in the fabric, so it can be a bit fiddly to actually get things hooked up. The Peugeot E-3008 has a 520-litre boot, which is smaller than most alternatives offer, with only the Kia EV6 having less space at 490 litres. The Tesla Model Y beats all with its massive 854-litre boot, while the Hyundai Ioniq 5 gets 571 litres and the Volkswagen ID4 has 543 litres. You could also consider the Skoda Elroq , which is much cheaper and not as posh inside, but has lots of practical features, but a smaller 470-litre boot. Folding the rear seats down in the E-3008 gives you a generous 1,480 litres of load space, but the seatbelts can become trapped when the backrests are put back in place, which is a bit frustrating. Another mark against the E-3008 is the lack of a front boot. The Model Y wins again here with a 117-litre space that’s a great place to store charging cables so they don’t get in the way in the main boot area. Both the Ioniq 5 and EV6 get a ‘froot’, too. At least the Peugeot has decent underfloor storage in the boot that presents a viable alternative location for your cables. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories The interior is arguably the most interesting of any mid-sized SUV on the market, but it loses some points for the occasional hard plastic trim Peugeot is building some of the best interiors in the business at the moment. Not only do you get funky designs, you also get upmarket materials that rival those you find in posh German cars. The E-3008 is no different, with its funky multi-layered design that should feel like a cluttered mess but is actually classy and coherent. Ignore the massive screens and it gives off 1970’s LA showhome vibes. There’s fabric on the centre part of the dashboard that sweeps around in front of you before seamlessly lining up with the centre console that splits the front seat passengers. There’s also a recessed area beneath the windscreen with ambient lighting that looks really classy. It’s a proper antidote to the boring minimalism seen in so many premium cars these days. Poke around in the lower areas of the cabin and there are cheaper plastics to be found, such as on the door bins, but they don’t detract from the overall ambience too much. Naturally, there are displays aplenty. Sat atop the dashboard is a sleek 21.0-inch screen – it's one complete unit with the information split into two sections. The one directly ahead shows all your driving information such as speed and range, and you get high-resolution maps to rival the class-leading Virtual Cockpit from Audi . On the right of this is the infotainment touchscreen, which is incredibly fast and feels on par with modern tablets for responsiveness. It’s a shame there are no physical buttons for the climate settings, but at least the temperature is always on the screen so you can change it without having to go through loads of menus. That being said, you have to navigate away from Apple CarPlay or Android Auto to change the climate settings, which can be anxiety-inducing on an unfamiliar road. There is, however, a handy shortcut button for the assistance systems, so you can quickly turn off anything that you find intrusive - though it is slightly awkward to reach behind the steering wheel. A third display that sits above the centre console, housing some shortcut buttons, and this is customisable so you can have your most-used settings quickly to hand. It’s a really clever and genuinely useful system. Electric range, charging and tax Electric range, charging and tax The entry-level E-3008 is only available with a 210hp single electric motor that’s powered by a 73kWh battery, giving it an official range of up to 327 miles. Acceleration is brisk rather than quick, with 0-62mph coming up in 8.8 seconds. That does make it easy to drive sensibly and get close to the official 4.5mi/kWh efficiency rating though. There’s also a long-range model available with a 97kWh battery, good for a highly impressive claimed range of 415 miles and with an extra 20 horsepower over the smaller battery model - though it feels identical to drive. At the top of the tree sits the high-performance, dual-motor model based on the 73kWh car. An additional 110hp motor at the back of the car gives it all-wheel drive and cuts the 0-60mph time down to 6.0 seconds with a range of 303 miles. All E-3008s are subject to the luxury car tax in years two-to-six on top of the typical flat rate of road tax after the first year, where you only pay £10. Being an EV means the E-3008 falls into the lowest band for benefit-in-kind tax ; an attractive proposition for company car drivers. Safety and security Safety and security The Peugeot E-3008 earned four out of five stars when tested by Euro NCAP in 2025. That’s a bit disappointing, scoring only 62% for its safety assistance tech, and a little surprising considering how much you get as standard. Post-collision braking, lane-keeping assistance and an emergency braking system with night-time detection of pedestrians and cyclists all come on the entry-level Allure model. They also come with basic cruise control, but GT versions upgrade this to adaptive cruise control, which maintains your distance to the car in front. You can also pay extra for a 360-degree camera. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems The old reputation of Peugeots being unreliable can be firmly forgotten, with the firm turning things around in recent years. The 2024 Driver Power owner survey actually saw Peugeot come sixth out of 32 manufacturers entered into the mix, a hugely promising result. How reliable the E-3008 will be remains to be seen, but Peugeot’s other electric cars haven't prompted any cause for concern. You get a three-year, unlimited mileage warranty as standard. This is in line with the time period offered by most car manufacturers in the UK, though some others do put a limit on the mileage. Hyundai betters this with five years, Kia offers seven years, and Toyota and Lexus cars have 10 years of warranty cover if you keep up annual servicing. On top of the standard Peugeot warranty, you also get eight years of cover for the main battery."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/peugeot/e-308,Peugeot e-308 Review & Prices,"€45,542",7/10,new,"Is the Peugeot e-308 a good car? Is the Peugeot e-308 a good car? Think of the new Peugeot e-308 as the concluding part of a trilogy: you can already buy a conventionally powered 308 and a plug-in hybrid, but now there’s a fully electric car to complete the set. The electric version is the most expensive of the three, which is to be expected as an electric car, but it’s also more expensive than most of the other battery-powered hatchbacks you might consider, such as the Volkswagen ID3 , Citroen e-C4 and Renault Megane E-Tech . And that’s for the five-door hatchback; there’s also an e-308 SW , which is something of a rarity as there aren’t many electric estate cars. What do you get for your money? Well, aside from the usual 308 good stuff – stylish looks and an upmarket cabin – the entry-level Allure model comes with 18-inch alloy wheels, heated front seats and steering wheel, and satellite navigation is standard along with a rear-view camera. Safety kit includes autonomous emergency braking and adaptive cruise control to hold a safe distance from the vehicle in front. GT models are about £2,000 more, adding full matrix LED headlights, 3D LED taillights, a GT-specific grille, and wider sills to add more aggression to the looks. The seats are trimmed with soft Alcantara , there’s aluminium trim on the dash and door panels, and you get front parking sensors. The 3D digital instrument cluster is a neat touch that adds cool factor to the cabin. For a short period, there’s also a limited-run First Edition. This costs a fraction less than the GT and has an exclusive interior with upholstery that combines cloth, synthetic leather and Alcantara. All three trim levels share the same electric motor and battery. The motor has 156hp, which should be enough for brisk rather than exciting performance – you won’t be keeping up with a Tesla Model 3 , that’s for sure. The 54kWh battery offers an official range of up to 250 miles, though the higher-spec car manages a couple of miles less due to its larger alloy wheels. That’s a little behind the Volkswagen ID3 Pro’s 266-mile range, despite the fact the Peugeot comes with a heat pump as standard to improve efficiency. Using that 250 miles of range is a generally pleasant experience. The e-308 manages to be comfortable around town, yet still has a bit of fun about it when the road goes twisty. But only up to a point. For an electric car, it's not very punchy at all, with only 156hp on offer where 200hp is more of a base level for electric hatchbacks these days. It's fine, just feels a bit sluggish if you've ever driven any of those VW, Cupra, MG or Renault alternatives that pack a bit more power and therefore a more impressive acceleration. When you do need to stop and recharge, the e-308 is capable of topping up its batteries from 20-80% in about 30 minutes using a 100kW rapid charger. A full charge from a 7.4kW home wallbox takes seven hours and 20 minutes. So, is the Peugeot e-308 a good car? Well, the regular Peugeot 308 earned score of 8/10 on Carwow, so it’s off to a strong start, but there’s no getting away from the fact it costs more than the talented alternatives listed above, and can’t go quite as far as the best electric hatchbacks on a full charge. But the interior quality is a step above the likes of the VW ID3, Vauxhall Astra Electric or MG 4, and it’s an all-round high-quality experience. Check out the latest Peugeot e-308 deals available through Carwow, or browse other new Peugeot deals , and you can also see the latest used Peugeot stock from a network of trusted dealers. Plus, you can sell your car through Carwow, too. How much is the Peugeot e-308? How much is the Peugeot e-308? The e-308 is another example of how Peugeot is pushing itself a little more upmarket, with the entry price outpointing Volkswagen and Cupra ’s electric hatchbacks despite offering less power and a shorter range than either. It’s only a couple of thousand pounds to step up from the Allure to GT trim level - the only two the electric 308 is offered in. Extra kit includes nicer 18-inch alloy wheels, full Matrix LED headlights, heated front seats and steering wheel and a host of other visual upgrades to make the car feel more expensive. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort The e-308 is a nice well-rounded driving experience no matter what type of road, although it doesn’t have the power or punch of most electric vehicles It’s a shame that there’s no one-pedal driving option in the Peugeot, as you get in cars such as the Nissan Leaf , where you can drive the majority of the time just using the accelerator as the car slows and can be brought to a complete stop when you lift off (which also, via regenerative braking , recoups more energy to be put back into the battery. With the e-308 you only get the regular drive mode, or hit the ‘B’ button for increased regen, but it’s not as effective as full-on one-pedal modes. The e-308 is also made less town-friendly by its small rear window and average-sized wing mirrors, neither of which help lift all-round visibility, although a rear parking camera is standard. Front parking sensors are though only standard on the GT. But the Peugeot rides over bumps and urban road furniture well, with no unpleasant thumping or banging rattling through the cabin despite the car being fitted with pretty large and attractive 18-inch alloy wheels as standard. And as with all EVs you get to enjoy cruising in serene and relaxing silence. Just be aware that car parks in particular are a place where EVs can creep up on unwary and inattentive pedestrians. It’s also worth noting that Peugeot seems to have finally dropped its horrible auto wiper set-up where a single sweep by flicking down on the wiper stalk would disengage the auto wiper function, so every time you got a run of water you wanted to sweep away you’d have to double-flick on the stalk to keep the auto function enabled. And the usual Peugeot warning applies to the e-308 as much as it does the other cars in the brand’s line-up, where the small steering wheel takes a bit of getting used to, and means you need to work harder to find the right driving position. Electric vehicles as a whole are never at their best on the motorway as higher speeds take their toll on the battery’s range. But keep the speed under control, or accept you’re not going to get near the official range, and the e-308 is a pleasant way to cover long distances, although there is a surprising amount of wind and road noise for an otherwise classy car. That’s amplified by the absence of engine noise. But as with around town, the Peugeot is a comfortable car for longer runs, with supportive front seats. But the car being quite severely down on power compared to other electric cars, such as the 218hp MG 4 or the 204hp of Volkswagen’s ID3 and the Cupra Born , is clearly felt when you’re trying to get up to motorway speed on a slip-road, for example. The 0-62mph acceleration time of almost 10 seconds is a bit lacklustre when cheaper electric hatches have significantly more performance. When the road gets twistier, the e-308 is surprisingly fun for a fairly low-powered electric car. That 156hp means the e-308 isn’t surging from bend to bend, but that doesn’t matter so much as it’s a hatchback not a performance car, and the lack of body roll and a steering weight that isn’t too light gives the confidence to drive B-roads at a brisk pace. More powerful EVs that haven’t been set up as performance cars sometimes feel a bit out of their depth when they can bolt from corner to corner but haven’t had any upgrades to the likes of the suspension, so aren’t any more adept at taking bends. The lack of body roll in particular is surprising because that would normally come hand-in-hand with a car that’s not great at absorbing bumps and ripples in the road. But while the e-308 isn’t the most cosseting of EV hatchbacks , it rides the bumps well and you feel them without them being uncomfortable. Space and practicality Space and practicality There’s a decent amount of interior stowage, but rear passenger and boot space are no better than average The front of the e-308 looks and feels cutting edge and classy, which is a good start. There are a couple of stowage areas including two cupholders and a little spot that works for keys or a phone. The under-arm storage area is small but does have a USB-C charging point to add to the single USB and the 12V sockets at the bottom of the dashboard. A nice touch is that the big door bins are lined, so you don't get the scratch sound of anything that’s been put in them sliding up and down hard plastic, as you do with many cars. As mentioned above, the small steering wheel does take a little getting used to, and adds another dimension to trying to find the best seating position so you’re not only comfortable, but can also see the dials. A pair of USB-C points greet rear occupants, as do a pair of nicely sculpted rear seats. Neither head or leg room are excessive, but it’s comfortable enough for a pair of adults, though comfort would be increased if it were easier to get your feet under the front seats. Those big and supportive seats do also impact the rear room a little. A third passenger will be less comfy, as even though the e-308 is an EV, it shares its set-up with petrol and diesel hatchbacks, so the floor isn’t flat in the middle, leaving a third passenger with a central tunnel to straddle their feet across. Getting in isn’t as easy as you’d hope thanks to a high door sill that you have to lift your feet over, but at least you get some big door bins to drop stuff into. The rear headrests are big and comfy, which is great for rear seat passengers but not so good for the driver’s rear visibility when they’re left up and the back seat isn’t occupied. The ISOFIX fitting on the two outer rear seats are hidden behind quite fiddly zips, which will annoy anyone that has to switch car seats in and out frequently. And there’s no front ISOFIX fitting. The boot drops from 421 to 361 litres when you go from petrol or diesel 308s into the electric version thanks to the battery packaging - another compromise of sharing the same design of car across multiple powertrains. But that’s still a decent size, out-pointing the MG 4, and within range of the 385 litres offered by both the Cupra Born and VW ID3, and the Citroen e-C4’ s 380. But the Renault Megane is the handiest hatch for boot space at a huge 440 litres. The rear seats drop to reveal a 1,271-litre space, and you’ll find a net for small items to one side of the boot, along with four tie-down points, but there are no bag hooks, power sockets or other cleverness, apart from a small under-floor area the charge cables will fit into. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories The e-308 impresses for interior quality and design in particular, although the infotainment system isn’t the most intuitive despite improvements over previous attempts such as handy shortcut buttons First impressions are excellent when you drop into the e-308’s cabin, with a neat and modern design backed up by some high-quality materials. You can tell Peugeot is trying to push itself upmarket with the step forward in cabin quality. The infotainment across Peugeot models has been something of a recent bugbear for usability reasons, and while diluted in the e-308, they’re still there. The 10.0-inch touchscreen is not the easiest system to navigate around to find the various functions, especially when on the move, although the addition of big shortcut buttons is a very welcome one in lieu of actually taking the climate control out of the touchscreen system, which would be the ideal solution. A nice touch is that the switches change colour when you engage sport mode. Electric range, charging and tax Electric range, charging and tax Peugeot keeps it simple with just the one battery and motor combination, but it’s a shame it’s all a bit middle-of-the-road in terms of efficiency and range. The 54kWh battery gives the e-308 an official range figure of 250 miles, which should mean around 200 in the real world. And that’s not a bad figure. It’s just that the similarly priced VW ID3 and Cupra Born eke out another 15 or so from a similar-sized battery on the official figures, and can offer pricier versions with bigger batteries too, while the Renault Megane goes up to 280 miles on its 60kWh battery. The story is slightly worse when it comes to charging rates, with the e-308 only able to charge at a maximum of 100kW, which is pretty slow by modern standards. The Cupra Born and VW ID3 are slightly faster at 120kW, the Renault Megane can take power at up to 130kW and the MG 4 and BYD Dolphin are as high as 150kW. It’s not a big difference, but will impact how much time you spend waiting for the car to recharge at high-powered charging points. Efficiency is also not quite up with the best either. Based on the number of miles each kilowatt can take the car, the e-308’s official figure is 3.8 miles per kWh, which is better than the MG 4, but a little off the others, with the VW ID3 sitting at up to 4.3 miles per kWh, likewise the BYD Dolphin, and the Renault Megane at 3.9. But at least the EV running costs benefits are alive and well, especially if you take the e-308 as a company car , due to the huge benefit-in-kind savings. A higher-rate tax payer would be looking at savings of around £1,500 for the 2024-25 tax year on the electric 308 versus the plug-in hybrid version, and that rises to savings in the region of £3,500 in company car tax alone versus the diesel 308 hatch. Then there’s road tax, with EVs sitting in the lowest Vehicle Excise Duty band. Safety and security Safety and security Although the e-308 hasn’t been tested specifically, the internal combustion-engined hatchback was tested by safety expert Euro NCAP in 2022 and scored a slightly disappointing four stars from the maximum of five. Protection of vulnerable road users wasn’t great, and the adult occupant score suffered from some marginal protection of the driver in the front impact test. Safety equipment includes the Active Safety Brake system that detects pedestrians or cyclists, even at night, as well as lane keeping assist, cruise control and six airbags. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems Peugeot’s warranty offering is the industry basic standard of three years or 60,000 miles, although the mileage limit doesn’t come into effect until the third year. But the battery on the electric car gets an additional eight-year/100,000-mile warranty backing it to be performing at at least 70% of original capacity."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/peugeot/3008,Peugeot 3008 Review & Prices,"€47,403",8/10,new,"Is the Peugeot 3008 a good car? Is the Peugeot 3008 a good car? Peugeot ’s 3008 has shot up the ranks since the first one was launched more than a decade ago. It may have started as a tall (and somewhat ugly) crossover , but now it’s a fully-fledged SUV -coupe, with really stylish looks and much more high-tech kit. It’s like someone who used to be a bit podgy, but has hit the gym and overhauled their wardrobe. While the all-electric version, the E-3008 , might get all the headlines, a big chunk of the 3008’s sales in the UK will be taken by this, the hybrid model — not least because, in spite of all the new on-board technology, it’s a fairly handy £10,000 less expensive than the E-3008… That being said, there are plenty of compelling alternatives to the Peugeot 3008, many of which are a bit more affordable. Some of the best all-rounders include the Nissan Qashqai , Kia Sportage and Hyundai Tucson . Then there's the practical, great value Citroen C5 Aircross and stylish but impractical Toyota C-HR to consider, too. Power for the 3008 Hybrid comes from a 134bhp 1.2-litre three-cylinder petrol engine — that’s the same one that Peugeot has been making for donkey’s years, but it’s been upgraded for life as a hybrid. The system sort of sits between a ‘traditional’ Toyota-style full hybrid and a mild-hybrid . So, the 3008 Hybrid can drive itself on electric power alone, but only for very short bursts at very low speeds. It’s good for around town, but less useful on long motorway hauls. Peugeot reckons you’ll get 51mpg out of it, and CO2 emissions are kept to a trim 124g/km. Inside, there’s a huge, sweeping all-digital 21.0-inch screen that dominates the cabin. It sits up and away from the driver, almost resting against the windscreen. As is Peugeot’s recent tradition, the steering wheel is small, hexagonal, and sits more or less in your lap. We've tried it in the E-3008 and it's much easier to find a comfortable driving position where the wheel doesn't block the instrument display than ever before, but it's probably still worth trying before you buy. To the right of the steering wheel is a slim touchpad which has configurable shortcut buttons for the big screen so that you can access the menus you need more easily, but sadly Peugeot insists on putting all of the climate control functions on the screen, which makes it more fiddly than it needs to be. The gear lever is now a chunky toggle switch behind the steering wheel, so that leaves the centre console free for cupholders and storage spaces, of which there are loads, and the 3008’s mixture of back-lighting and soft fabric surfaces on the dashboard make for a cabin that’s almost good enough to challenge the mighty Germans on quality, and surpass them on design. In spite of that rakish roof, there’s good space in the back seats, even for grown-ups, although those with longer legs will find that their feet and knees sit up a bit too high, as the floor has been raised up to make space for the electric version’s battery pack. The boot is a useful 520 litres, but that sloping roofline makes loading in really bulky items a bit of a challenge, and alternatives such as the Hyundai Tucson have a larger capacity. Speaking of that roofline, the Peugeot 3008 is a really good-looking thing. It manages to be imposingly chunky while also sporting sleek lines and cool details such as Peugeot's signature three-claw light designs. Stick with Carwow if you want the best Peugeot 3008 deals .

How much is the Peugeot 3008? How much is the Peugeot 3008? If you’re looking at a Peugeot 3008, be aware that it’s one of the more expensive family SUVs, which is the price you pay for an interior that’s not far off premium German alternatives. Even when focusing on comparable hybrid versions only, the Nissan Qashqai is one of the more affordable options, followed by the Kia Sportage, while the Hyundai Tucson and Toyota C-HR are closer to the Peugeot in price. The Citroen C5 Aircross is the easy choice if you only care about practicality – it’s nowhere near as posh inside but it has a cavernous boot. Equipment levels are pretty good on the Peugeot 3008. The massive widescreen display is a highlight, and you also get a textured dashboard and part-fabric upholstery inside. GT models are better equipped, with adaptive cruise control, Alcantara upholstery and Pixel LED headlights, which can maintain the full beam without blinding oncoming drivers. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort Comfortable on the motorway but not as much fun as a Ford Kuga through the bends The 3008’s hybrid engine is a bit clunkier than the one you get on a Toyota RAV4 - you notice the transition between petrol and electric power more in the Peugeot, and its six-speed gearbox lurches around a bit more than Toyota’s continuously variable transmission. However, there’s plenty of get-up-and-go from low speeds thanks to the electric assistance, and in normal driving the whole set-up fares reasonably well. It’s certainly smoother than the old 3008 was when it was fitted with the non-hybrid 1.2-litre petrol and an automatic gearbox. The 3008 rides over bumps quite well too thanks to soft suspension. It has an easier job here than the much heavier E-3008 does, but it’s not so softly sprung that you’ll find your head bobbling about on rough road surfaces. A Skoda Karoq does feel more tied-down, though. With just 136hp on tap the 3008 isn’t particularly rapid, and you will need to put your foot down quite a lot when you’re joining from a short sliproad or trying to rapidly overtake. There’s enough power that you don’t feel completely outclassed, but a Nissan Qashqai hybrid or Kia Sportage hybrid both feel more relaxed at high speeds. The Peugeot does win some more points back with its suspension, though, which makes short work of lumps and bumps on the motorway. It’s also very refined, provided the engine’s settled down to low revs - wind and road noise are both well-contained. Assisted driving features present in the 3008 are good but not flawless - the adaptive cruise control can get spooked and has some phantom braking, but the lane-keeping aids are good and unobtrusive. They’re also easy to engage from buttons on the steering wheel, where the previous 3008 had an awkward column stalk. The 3008’s modest power output and soft suspension mean that it’s not really the most satisfying car to drive down a winding B-road. It’s safe and unflustered, but it leans quite a lot in the bends and the super-light steering - while very quick - doesn’t really match up in terms of feedback and accuracy. It feels quite remote, where a SEAT Ateca or Ford Kuga make you feel a bit more connected to the road and are therefore more satisfying to drive quickly. There is a ‘Sport’ driving mode, but this is limited to the throttle and gearbox responses as well as the steering weight - the 3008 doesn’t get adjustable suspension, so it still leans just as much in Sport mode. And the heavier steering feels unnatural, while the hyperactive gearbox just gets in the way. Better to leave it in ‘Normal’ mode and just take things a bit more gently. Space and practicality Space and practicality Cabin storage is excellent, but the boot isn’t as big as you’ll find in other cars If cabin storage is key then the Peugeot 3008 will appeal. There are loads of places to put things. Starting with the door bins, they’re an okay size but items will rattle around a lot because there’s no soft lining. That’s where the complaints end though, because there’s a pair of cupholders for your morning coffee and a big area under the armrest that can be chilled. Look under the screens and you’ll find another cubby hole, this one having a lovely soft-close cover. There’s also a pair of USB-A slots for charging mobile phones. It’s spacious for people too, even though the dashboard and centre console rather wrap around you – it’s cosy more than cramped. Finding a good driving position is pretty easy, because although the steering wheel doesn’t move much, the seat has a lot of adjustability to compensate. If you’ve encountered issues with the wheel blocking the instrument screen in other Peugeots, the 3008’s layout does a good job of minimising this issue. There’s a lot of room in the back, too. You might expect headroom to be limited on account of that sloping roof, but even taller passengers will find it spacious, and their knees won’t be touching the seat in front. The floor is quite high though, meaning your thighs don’t rest on the seat cushion, which could be tiresome on long journeys. You also get fewer storage areas in the back seats compared with up front. The door bins will hold a small bottle, and there are no USB slots at all. On a positive note, it’s easy to fit a child seat in the back because it’s so roomy and the doors open nice and wide. It can be a bit tricky to find the ISOFIX mounting points though, because they’re hidden behind zips in the fabric. With a 520-litre boot, the Peugeot 3008 will be spacious enough for most, but it offers less space than some of its alternatives. The Hyundai Tucson is the biggest option, with 620 litres in non-hybrid versions, and even though this drops to 577 litres in the self-charging hybrid and 558 litres in the plug-in version, that’s still more than you get in the Peugeot. Other options include the Kia Sportage with 591 litres, and Citroen C5 Aircross, which has 580 litres as standard, but you can slide the rear seats forward to open up 720 litres of boot space. The Nissan Qashqai and Mazda CX-5 are two potential alternatives, but both have smaller boots at just over 500 litres each. Then there’s the Toyota C-HR, which is miles behind at 388 litres. It’s worth noting, though, that the 3008’s boot is quite deep but not very high, so it’s easy to fit a big shop in there, but larger items might hit the sloping bootlid. The bumper is quite high off the ground, which could make it tricky to lift heavy items, but at least there’s no lip to get in the way. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories High-tech and high-quality, the 3008 has a lovely interior, but scratchy plastics can be found if you go looking It’s the interior that goes a long way to justify the Peugeot 3008 being a little pricier than many alternatives you might consider. The design is fantastic, and a real breath of fresh air after the constant stream of plain cabins you’ll see in modern cars in the name of ‘minimalism’. There’s an almost retro vibe to the design and materials, but this is shattered by the massive widescreen setup atop the dashboard. Paired with another slim screen for the shortcut buttons below this, it’s like walking into the TV section of your local John Lewis. There are some buttons in the centre console, but most systems are controlled through the touchscreen. This is a pain for some features, such as the climate controls, but at least these are always visible at the sides of the screen, and the shortcut buttons are customisable so you can find what you regularly use quickly. The main screen is a single 21.0-inch display that's split in two sections, with the one on the right being a touchscreen for your infotainment system. It’s incredibly quick to respond to your touch and feels more like a modern tablet than the sluggish systems you often find in cars. The other display sits directly ahead of you and shows your speed, range and other useful information. It’s crisp and clear but not quite as fancy to look at as Aud i’s Virtual Cockpit setup. Between the two is a shortcut to the home and driver assistance systems, which is useful if you want to quickly turn any off on the move. It’s hard to find much to fault inside, but despite the generally upmarket feel there are a few areas that don’t hold up to scrutiny. The door bins and the lower centre console have some cheap scratchy plastics, but they are fortunately largely out of sight. MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax There’s a single engine option in the Peugeot 3008. It’s a hybrid that pairs a 1.2-litre petrol engine with a small electric motor - it’s not a proper self-charging system like you’ll find in most hybrids, but it’s more than a mild hybrid. It means you can run on electricity for short periods to reduce fuel consumption, but you won’t be able to treat it like an electric car with a backup fuel tank like you can with a plug-in hybrid. You get 136hp from the petrol engine, coupled with 22hp from the electric motor. First drive opportunities will arrive later in 2024 so check back for confirmation, but those figures – and the 10.2-second 0-62mph time – suggest it won’t be particularly sprightly. With official testing recording up to 52.5mpg in mixed driving, its lack of get-up-and-go should be compensated for by pretty low running costs. Again, check back to see how achievable that is in the real world… What you can know for sure is that its CO2 emissions figures mean car tax is relatively low, but company car drivers will get a better benefit-in-kind rate from a plug-in hybrid or electric car. If this relates to you, there is the all-electric E-3008 to consider. It has more power at 210hp and gets to 62mph about two seconds quicker. You also benefit from the mega-low benefit-in-kind rate as well as lower running costs of electricity – though the advantage of this won’t be so obvious if you have to rely on expensive public charging. Safety and security Safety and security The Peugeot 3008 has not been safety tested by Euro NCAP yet. However, it’s worth noting that the 408 and 308, the two most recent Peugeots to undergo the tests, have received four stars out of five. That's mildly disappointing compared with most alternatives, which typically score full marks. You get some basic driver assistance kit as standard, including lane-keeping , emergency braking and a post-collision braking system. Basic cruise control comes as standard with Allure models, but upgrade to GT and you get adaptive cruise control to maintain your distance to the car in front. A 360-degree parking camera is also available for extra cost. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems While you might be concerned about Peugeot’s reliability record, the French firm has largely turned this around recently, scoring highly with UK consumers in reliability and owner satisfaction surveys. It remains to be seen whether the 3008 will be reliable, but the signs are positive. You get a fairly basic warranty, which at three years with unlimited mileage is about average. Hyundai, Kia and Toyota all offer longer warranties, which can be passed on to new owners and therefore helps with resale value. Peugeot 3008 FAQs Peugeot 3008 FAQs"
https://www.carwow.co.uk/peugeot/e-208,Peugeot e-208 Review & Prices,"€36,861",8/10,new,"Is the Peugeot E-208 a good car? Is the Peugeot E-208 a good car? The Peugeot E-208 has had a facelift, updating the all-electric hatchback with a fresh look, a bigger battery and a more powerful electric motor. This makes it a much more competitive small EV, and much easier to consider against great electric cars such as the Mini Cooper Electric , the MG4 and the Cupra Born . An immediate plus point the E-208 has going for it is its size. It’s the same size as the regular petrol 208 , so it’s quite a bit smaller than most EVs. If you want something nippy and compact, perfect for city driving, the E-208 is your best bet this side of a Fiat 500 Electric . Peugeot E-208: electric range, battery and charging data Range: 217 - 245 miles Efficiency: 4.3 - 4.5 mi/kWh Battery size: 50 - 54kWh Max charge speed: 100kW Charge time AC: 0 - 100% 7hr 45m Charge time DC: 20 - 80% 25m Charge port location: Rear left Power outputs: 136 - 156hp It’s also quite sensible and pragmatic, despite its posh outward appearance and high-tech cabin. In that regard it’s a bit like putting a fancy phone case on your work phone - yes, it looks good, but it’s all business where it counts. For 2024 Peugeot upgraded the E-208’s exterior looks. But part of the appeal is that there’s very little to mark it out as an electric car - if you didn’t spot the green flash on the number plate or the discreet ‘E’ badging, you’d think it was just a regular petrol 208. It does look smart, though, with distinctive ‘triple-claw’ LED daytime running lights front and rear, smart diamond-cut alloy wheels and even a homage to the old Peugeot 205 in the shape of its rear window. That compact silhouette hides an interior that is a bit tighter than the class best. The rear seats are quite cramped, and even the front seats aren’t the best for very tall drivers. The boot, though quite roomy at 311 litres, can’t compete with larger cars of a similar price, such as the 363-litre MG4 EV and the 385-litre Cupra Born. The E-208 is at least much more roomy than the Mini Cooper Electric - and its dashboard has a similar wow factor, too. It’s beautifully built, with lots of squashy, high-quality materials, and the 10.0-inch touchscreen that sits on the top is clear, responsive and quite easy to use. Other nice touches include the row of piano-style keys underneath the screen, while Peugeot’s i-Cockpit dial layout is present and correct - though it still won’t suit everybody’s driving position. You get a choice of two battery and motor combos. The entry-level is the same one the E-208 was offered with at launch in 2019 - a 50kWh battery and 136hp electric motor. The newer variant of this has 54kWh and 156hp to play with - not a big boost, but huge improvements in efficiency mean this is by far the best option to select. To drive, the E-208 isn’t as rapid as an MG4 or a Cupra Born, and as a result it doesn’t feel too dissimilar to the regular petrol automatic 208. It’s great to drive in town thanks to compact dimensions and quick steering, though the aforementioned MG and Cupra are more entertaining to drive on a twisty road mainly thanks to their rear-wheel drive chassis. But if you want a good-looking small electric car with a standout interior, check out our best Peugeot E-208 deals here. You can browse great deals on other Peugeot models here, or find a used Peugeot for sale here. And remember to consider Carwow when you come to sell your old car - our network of trusted dealers will ensure you get the best possible price. How much is the Peugeot E-208? How much is the Peugeot E-208? The E-208 starts at just under £30,000, though for less than £1,000 extra you can up-spec to the 156hp motor and larger battery - this is a no-brainer. This makes the E-208 a little cheaper than a Cupra Born, but quite a bit pricier than an MG4 EV. You can choose from the same two trim levels as the regular 208 - Allure and GT. The former has 16-inch alloy wheels, all-round parking sensors, artificial leather trim on the upholstery and that 10.0-inch infotainment touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. The GT model adds on 17-inch wheels, a 3D-effect instrument cluster, fancier LED headlights and full artificial leather upholstery. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort Quick and responsive, the E-208 is great around town. The ride is harder than on the regular 208, though, and the brakes can take a bit of time to get used to The Peugeot E-208 is in its element around town, its responsive electric motor and nippy performance allow you to zip into gaps in traffic with ease. The regenerative braking means you don’t have to touch the brake pedal much, which is a good thing as it can feel a bit squishy at first and takes some time to get used to. Standard parking sensors help when reversing into bays, although the large front pillars can obscure your view when looking at cars approaching from side roads ahead of you. Being a bit heavier than a regular 208 means that the suspension has had to be tweaked, this has made the E-208’s ride a bit more unyielding over bumps. It’s still more comfortable than the sporty Mini Cooper Electric, though. The e-208 is refined and quiet at motorway speeds, it’s got enough power to overtake slower traffic and will happily cruise along at 70mph even when fully loaded. The large front pillars aren’t such an issue here, and you get cruise control, lane keep assist and driver attention warning as standard. GT trims come with the Driver Assist Pack which also includes adaptive cruise control, which is great on long motorway journeys. The e-208 steers and turns competently, but there’s not much in the way of excitement to the way it goes about it. There’s also a bit of body lean through fast corners. Despite a boost in power with the facelift, the E-208 doesn't feel particularly fast on the open road compared to EVs which may have over 200hp. Part of the reason is that, in Normal and Eco driving modes, the E-208 limits the available power - you only get its full 156hp in Sport mode, which many people won't bother engaging. If a fun driving experience is a priority, the Mini Cooper Electric is the way to go. Space and practicality Space and practicality The E-208 is spacious up front and has decent boot space, but rear space is tight for adults The front – as it is in most of the alternatives – is spacious enough to accommodate two adults without issue. The seats offer plenty of adjustment, and the steering wheel can be adjusted for rake and reach, which is important as it can obscure the dials in certain positions. When it comes to your bits and bobs, the Peugeot E-208 offers generous door bins, two cupholders and a storage tray ahead of the gear lever which offers wireless phone charging on higher trims. There’s also a cubby between the front seats and a small glovebox for personal items you want to keep hidden from view. The E-208's rear doors are pretty small, and they hide a rear seat which isn't anywhere near spacious enough for adults unless it's a very short journey. With a six-foot driver, only very short people will be able to get comfortable in the rear, with very little legroom - though headroom is acceptable. The flat footwell makes the centre rear seat easy to slide into, even if it isn’t quite as comfy as the outer two pews. Door bins and front seatback pockets are provided as storage, and there are also two USB slots in the back to charge devices with. Thanks to some clever packaging, the E-208 offers the same 311 litres of space as the regular 208. That's not a bad size, though larger EVs have more room - the MG4 has 363 litres, for example, and the Cupra Born 385. The charging cables do take up a bit of space though, and the narrow boot opening can make it tricky to load wider items. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories Few alternatives look as fresh inside, and the material quality is decent, aside from a few hard plastics bits of trim around the cabin The two-tier dashboard design and driver-centric angle of the infotainment unit are identical to the layout you get in the regular 208, but that’s no bad thing. The overall effect is a lot more impressive than you would expect from a small electric hatchback , and most of the materials are of a decent quality, too, aside from some cheaper feeling plastics in the lower half of the cabin. The rest of the switchgear feels nicely made, although the touch-sensitive infotainment shortcut buttons are a bit fiddly, but you can access most of the commonly used features from the main menu instead. A 7.0-inch touchscreen infotainment system is offered on the base Active Premium+ and Allure Premium+ trims, it comes standard with Bluetooth connectivity and DAB Radio as well as Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. GT trims get a larger 10.0-inch unit which also includes sat-nav. Both units offer sharp graphics and are easy enough to use, however the smallish buttons can be hard to press while on the move. The Peugeot’s USP is its cool 3D digital dials. You get it from the Allure Premium+ trim as standard, and it projects information on three different layers to create a 3D effect that helps it literally and figuratively stand out from the displays found in other cars of this size and price. The display is customisable and offers up additional information on the state of charge and range in the e-208. Electric range, charging and tax Electric range, charging and tax You get two choices of battery and motor with the E-208. The first is a 50kWh battery back with a 136hp electric motor - this is the same one originally offered at launch in 2019. It promises a maximum range of 217 miles, but in our experience you'd be lucky to get more than 150 miles. That should be fine for some, but for just a little bit extra you can upgrade to a 54kWh battery and 156hp electric motor. While that sounds like a modest increase in battery capacity, it's come with a big boost in efficiency - the E-208 thus equipped can go over 200 miles on a charge, against an official range of 247 miles. That makes it significantly more usable in the real world, even if it's not much more powerful. Charging times from 0-100% can take as long as 24 hours if you use a standard three-pin plug, however, a 7.4kW wallbox will do the same job in just seven and a half hours. A public fast charger will get you from 0-80% in just half an hour. The ability to charge at 100kW is a bonus for the e-208, being faster than the Mini Cooper Electric's 75kW max rate. The Peugeot E-208 has no road tax cost and the company car Benefit-in-Kind (BIK) tax rate is low. You are also exempt from congestion charge fees in low emissions zones. Safety and security Safety and security The Peugeot 208 went through Euro NCAP testing in 2019, scoring four out of five stars overall. Despite missing out on all five stars, it scored an impressive 91% for adult occupant safety and 86% for child occupant safety. The low 56% score for protecting vulnerable road users was what let it down. All Peugeot E-208 models come standard with rear parking sensors, lane keep assist, driver attention warning, active brake assist and cruise control. Adaptive cruise control and lane position assist are available on the top GT Premium trim and optional on all but the base Active Premium+ model. You also get a reversing camera on the Allure Premium+ trim and front and rear parking sensors on the top GT trims. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems Peugeot has fared well as a company in recent customer satisfaction surveys, with the regular 208 achieving mid-field results overall. In fact, Peugeot scored an impressive sixth place in the 2024 Driver Power owner satisfaction survey, just behind Citroen. Peugeot offers its standard three-year/60,000-mile warranty for the e-208, with the battery pack covered by a separate eight-year/100,000-mile warranty. All pretty standard fare, as is the option to extend the standard warranty by a few more years as long as the vehicle is under 10 years old and has covered under 100,000-miles.

Think of the Peugeot 208 as the chocolate truffle of the small hatchback market, where the alternatives are an assortment of tarts and pastries. It’s a bit smaller than you might want at times, but ultimately it feels that little bit more special and luxurious. That doesn’t mean it’s the obvious choice though, because the Renault Clio runs the 208 close for style points, the Audi A1 might just have the Peugeot edged out on badge appeal and the Skoda Fabia brings a heavy dose of practicality to the table. Yet for its numerous alternatives, the 208 certainly stands out on the road. Though the latest model was launched back in 2019, the 208 looks bang up to date after a 2024 refresh. Lion claw-themed running lights and an intricate grille tie the car’s front end in with a similar motif for the LED taillights. A retro side-window shape inspired by the iconic 205, chunky gloss-black wheel arches and a selection of intricate wheel designs all add some flair to the chic, sporty looking hatchback. Peugeot has done just as good a job with the 208’s interior, which looks and feels as though it’s been taken out of a much more expensive car. The dashboard is intricate without feeling fussy, wrapping around the driver and passenger while clearly displaying the standard-fit 10.0-inch touchscreen infotainment display. GT-spec models get an uber-cool 3D-effect driver’s screen, though lesser trims still get a digital display, and all models have soft-touch materials in abundance. There is the odd scratchy plastic on the door cards and lower dashboard, but other aspects such as the lovely, clicky dashboard button are nice to the touch. The 208 is fitted with Peugeot’s i-Cockpit dashboard layout, where the steering wheel is small and mounted low down. Long-legged drivers may find it odd to get used to, but the small wheel adds to the car’s agile feeling around corners. Sadly, it’s not very spacious inside; squeezing four adults into the 208 makes for a rather cosy environment, and fitting one six-footer behind another is best saved for emergencies. The boot is smaller than in the Renault Clio and Volkswagen Polo at 311 litres, and you’ve got a high load lip to contend with when loading heavy items too. Entry-level 208 Style models are powered by a 1.2-litre petrol engine with a manual gearbox , but Allure, GT and GT Premium cars have an automatic , hybrid unit instead. They’re all fuel efficient and smooth, but the hybrid options are far punchier and add some extra sportiness to the 208’s driving experience. The additional power makes the hybrid 208 easier to dart around town in, and it’s more relaxing to drive with its automatic gearbox - though it can be a bit lethargic when changing gear. It’s an easy car to pile motorway miles on too, with only a little wind noise to contend with. Country roads are quite fun, and the hybrid models have plenty of punch to accelerate between corners, though the Renault Clio has it pipped when it comes to sporty driving. Still, the 208 can put a smile on your face when hustling along on a bendy road. As far as small hatchbacks go, the Peugeot 208 may not be the most practical option, but it’s got enough charisma and style about it to tempt you away from cars with posher badges on the back.

The Peugeot 208 starts at a smidge under £20,000 for the entry-level Style model, with a rather large jump to the hybrid Allure model. GT and GT Premium models are a couple of thousand more on top, each. All 208 models come equipped with the 10.0-inch infotainment display as standard, as well as rear parking sensors and a leather steering wheel. Style cars come with 16-inch steel wheels with diamond cut-effect trims, which feels a bit outdated, but Allure models get alloy wheels and a body-coloured grille as standard. GT-trim cars upgrade to the 3D instrument display, sports seats and 17-inch alloy wheels, plus you get auto-high beam LED headlights and a funky interior with green stitching to match the lime-green paint finish. GT Premium trim adds heated and electrically adjustable, Alcantara-trimmed seats too. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort Petrol and hybrid engines are eager and efficient, and the 208 is great to drive - though a Renault Clio is more fun The 208’s small steering wheel and light steering make it extremely easy to thread about urban streets. Visibility is good straight ahead, but to the sides and behind, the 208’s swoopy styling makes for rather large blind spots. Still, all-round parking sensors and a reversing camera are standard, so you should have no trouble when it comes to slotting it into small spaces. The smaller-wheeled Allure model is more comfortable over bumps at low speeds than the sportier, larger-wheeled GT. Even then, the 208 isn’t as settled over broken urban road surfaces as a Polo, but it never frustrates. All of the engines cope well with traffic but the hybrids are the nicest to drive in town. They can drive on electric power for short periods, and they also come with automatic gearboxes to take the strain off your left leg. All 208s are pretty good on the motorway. Even the basic 100hp petrol has enough punch to easily get up to speed, and as it's a six-speed manual gearbox the top gear is enough for comfortable cruising without the engine revving too fast. The hybrids are better still as they have a bit of extra punch, though all the engines can be quite noisy when you're revving them hard. The comfort over bumps improves the faster you go in all models, and the 208 stays nicely planted at speed on the motorway. Avoiding the larger alloy wheels means less road noise, too, and the only wind noise is a faint bit around the door mirrors at 70mph. The 208’s small steering wheel and light steering make it feel sporty and fun to thread around twisty roads, although ultimately the 208 doesn’t feel as fun as Renault Clio. Its steering isn’t as communicative and it doesn’t contain its body lean in bends quite as well either, but there’s nothing alarmingly bad about the way it corners. It has high grip levels and enough steering accuracy to be confident in what you’re doing. Space and practicality Space and practicality Two adults will have no issues in the front, but space in the back is more limited and the 208’s boot is average in size for the class The 208 is a small car, so owners won’t be expecting miracles, but it is worth noting that the Peugeot isn’t going to cut it as a family car once your children grow into lanky teens as it starts to get tight on head and legroom in the back. Two adults will have no problems getting comfortable in the front seats and the driver gets loads of standard manual seat and wheel adjustment. Electric adjustment is optional if preferred. Taller drivers will note, however, that the seat sits quite far back - actually behind the B-pillar - so getting in can be a little awkward and the seatbelt doesn't always sit very comfortably. There’s not quite as much headroom as you’d find in taller cars such as a Volkswagen Polo or Honda Jazz though, but it won’t be an issue unless you are much bigger than average. However, the tiny and oddly shaped steering wheel can cause issues - depending on your driving position - as it blocks the view to some of the instruments when in its most comfortable position. Between the front seats is an armrest which covers a storage space which is big enough for a purse or phone. Elsewhere in the cabin there are quirky features such as a flip-down smartphone ledge, along with decent sized (but more conventional) door pockets and a small glovebox. As you’d expect, there are also cupholders behind the gear lever. Adults in the back seats will find their knees brushing the front seat backs even if their heads are clear of the ceiling. They will also have to fold themselves up in order to access the back seats in the first place. The door openings are deceptively small, which will make it tricky for those of larger proportions or who are less mobile. The two outer seats are comfortable enough once the headrests have been moved up, but the sculpting of the bench means anyone in the middle is going to feel short changed. The door bins are smaller but still take a litre bottle of water. The nets on the backs of the front seats are pretty shallow, though, and there’s no rear armrest or cupholders. At 311 litres the Peugeot 208’s boot is average compared with its alternatives. To put it into context, it’s slightly larger than the boot in a Vauxhall Corsa , but around 10% smaller than the Volkswagen Polo and Seat Ibiza . There’s quite a pronounced lip to lift your bags over, but the access is good via the opening and once your bags are inside the space on offer is a usefully square shape – albeit on the narrow side. You have to do without any handy extras such as hooks, lashing points or 12v sockets, and there’s no option of a variable height boot floor either. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories The Peugeot 208’s interior not only looks stylish, it is also well built from quality materials. Its infotainment system has all the kit you want, too, although it can be fiddly to use Not only does the 208 look striking outside, it stands out for its interior design and quality too. There are some cheaper feeling plastics on the door tops and lower-down areas, but overall the soft-touch dashboard and classy, nicely damped switches help the 208 feel a cut above the rest. The two-tier, concave dash design is striking, too, and touch-sensitive buttons for the infotainment and heated seat controls (if fitted) that help make the 208 feel more expensive inside. Entry-level models get part-leather seats and a leather steering wheel, while the GT upgrades this to full faux leather. On the tech front, a 10.0.0-inch touchscreen infotainment system sits atop the 208’s dashboard as standard, which includes DAB radio and Bluetooth, but more importantly Apple CarPlay and Android Auto too. Peugeot’s new 3D digital dials are standard from Allure trim. They’re projected onto different layers to give a three-dimensional effect and look superb, but importantly also display key information clearly and are customisable so you can choose what you want to see. Wireless charging also comes as standard for the GT model, but if your smartphone can’t handle that then the USB connections are plentiful – there are two in the front (one standard, one USB-C) and you get a further two in the back. There’s just one six-speaker audio system across the range and no option to upgrade, but it offers a good sound in any case. MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax The 208 should prove pretty cheap to run, with all engines providing good fuel economy. Sadly the mega-efficient diesel is no longer available, but in its place you'll find a couple of hybrids which promise to come close to it in terms of real-world running costs. The entry-level 1.2-petrol should be good for around 50mpg if driven carefully, while both the 110hp and the 145hp hybrid options should return in excess of 40mpg and 50mpg respectively. The hybrids are also great for round-town economy, where the stop-start nature allows them to make the most of their battery assistance - though they're not quite as accomplished as the diesel was when it comes to long-distance fuel economy. Other running costs should be low. Insurance is reasonable, though there's no real entry-level petrol model to keep costs down for the youngest drivers. As for road tax , CO2 emissions are low enough to give either a £195 or a £220 bill for the first year - not too unreasonable. They also result in palatable Benefit-In-Kind costs for company car drivers, though the all-electric E-208 is the much more obvious choice for this. Safety and security Safety and security In terms of safety, the 208 scored four stars in the independent Euro NCAP safety assessment, which is average for a car of this size and price. All versions have Automatic Emergency Braking, road sign recognition and a lane departure warning system as standard, but the AEB is more sophisticated on the GT models as it will also spot (and stop for) pedestrians and cyclists. Top-spec models also add adaptive cruise control and active lane positioning on the automatic gearbox equipped models. In terms of security, all 208s have an alarm and remote central locking as standard. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems Peugeot doesn’t historically have the greatest of reputations for reliability, but it is getting better and this is reflected in customer satisfaction surveys, where it now rates above average. A sixth-place finish in the 2024 Driver Power owner satisfaction survey is particularly impressive, ranking just behind Citroen but importantly many places ahead of Renault, Volkswagen and even Toyota. The company’s three-year warranty offering is only average, although it does cover you for unlimited miles in the first two years. The third year only covers up to 60,000 miles though.

https://www.carwow.co.uk/peugeot/508-pse,Peugeot 508 PSE Review & Prices,"€32,291",7/10,used,"Is the Peugeot 508 PSE a good car? Is the Peugeot 508 PSE a good car? If you want to slash your fuel bill but aren’t quite prepared to give up on the performance car lifestyle, the new Peugeot 508 PSE might be right up your alley. Not only can this practical plug-in hybrid accelerate from 0-62mph in 5.2 seconds, but Peugeot also claims it can travel 34 miles on nothing but electricity. It’s definitely a sight for sore eyes, too, which is a good thing considering it’s set to go up against go-faster versions of the BMW 3 Series and Volvo S60 . The regular 508 is already one of the most handsome cars around – both in saloon and 'SW' estate form – but with its massive 20-inch alloys, aggressive new bodywork and vivid green accents, the updated-for-2023 508 Peugeot Sport Engineered (PSE) looks even more athletic than ever before. Kind of like Brad Pitt would if he was wearing his gym kit. This sporting theme continues on the inside. It’s all dark leather upholstery, soft touch plastics and bright, contrasting stitching in here – and they all combine to pretty stunning effect. The 508 PSE looks and feels like a properly high-end sporting saloon (or estate), and its mid-life update only improved things. A new 10.0-inch infotainment screen with sat nav is now standard across the range. That's a good thing, but the driving position is a bit more of a controversial issue. The seats offer plenty of adjustment and are impressively supportive, but the low-set, small-diameter steering wheel might just feel plain weird to some, and could block the updated digital dials, depending on your driving position. Headroom in the back is pretty tight too, but this go-faster 508 does at least have a large boot. It’ll get you and your luggage down the road very quickly, too. By combining a regular petrol engine with not one, but two electric motors (one at each end for all-wheel-drive), the 508 PSE puts down an impressive 360hp. And when you’re not in the mood to really get your foot down, its 12.4Wh battery will let you travel 34 miles on nothing but electricity. Admittedly, despite adding a few miles with the latest update, that claimed figure is a touch limited next to other sporty plug-in hybrid saloons, which is important if you’re planning on running one as a company car. As it stands, it slots into the 14% benefit-in-kind tax bracket. Don’t let the 508’s sporty looks and performance fool you into thinking that it’s too hardcore for daily use, either. Sure, you’re aware of its more athletic suspension when you’re driving around town or out on the motorway, but it doesn’t crash over bumps and is impressively comfortable over distance. Those large 20-inch alloys to generate a fair bit of road noise, mind. Still, this is a problem that can be easily solved. The Peugeot 508 PSE comes with an excellent Focal premium sound system as standard, along with everything from DAB radio to Bluetooth, and satellite navigation to Apple CarPlay and Android Auto . There’s lots of useful safety tech, too. A 360-degree camera and rear parking sensors will come in handy in town, while things like adaptive cruise control, autonomous emergency braking and lane-keep assist will help to keep things comfortable and safe on the motorway. Of course, a car with this much sporting potential and on-board tech isn’t particularly cheap. Prices start at just under £54,000, which is about what you’d pay for a plug-in hybrid from Volvo , or for a genuine six-cylinder performance car from BMW . But if this handsome French athlete is up your alley, head on over to our Peugeot 508 PSE deals page to see how much money we can save, or browse used 508 PSE models from our network of trusted dealers. You can also have a look at our latest used Peugeot cars for sale , and see how you can sell your car for through carwow. How much is the Peugeot 508 PSE? How much is the Peugeot 508 PSE? Being a fairly big, fairly fast car with a plug-in hybrid powertrain means that the Peugeot 508 PSE was never going to be cheap. Even bearing this in mind, it's very expensive. For a similar price, you can get into a Volvo S60 – its hybrid engine is more powerful and it has a nicer interior with more badge appeal, but it's comfort-focused rather than sporty. It's considerably more expensive than a plug-in BMW 3 Series, too, though if you want the sporty M340i version and its 374hp six-cylinder petrol engine, you're looking at similar cash. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort The 508 PSE is quick in a straight line and surprisingly comfortable given its sporty set up, but electric range is limited Because of its low-set driving position, steep windscreen and small rear window, the view out front and back isn’t quite as good as we’d like. It’s certainly not a tricky car to navigate around tight city streets, but it’s something to be aware of, particularly in the estate, which has a small rear windscreen and chunky pillars that block your view. It’s comfortable on all manner of road surfaces, and even with those big 20-inch alloys it deals with lumps and bumps with little in the way of fuss or bother. You're certainly aware it's bumpier than a non-PSE 508, but the car settles quickly over road imperfections and doesn't crash through potholes like some sporty cars do. Out on the motorway, it really impresses. Yes, there’s a bit of road noise, but thanks to its sleek shape there is hardly any wind noise. With gadgets like adaptive cruise control and lane-keep assist, long-distance drives should be a little less taxing. Getting up to speed is easy too, thanks to that punchy plug-in hybrid engine and clever gearbox that's always quick to respond when you need it to. It means that pulling off overtakes is a breeze and doesn't require much planning ahead. The downside to this engine, though, is that if you do a lot of motorway miles you won't see very good fuel economy. If you keep the batteries topped up and typically do shorter journeys it will sip fuel, but out on the motorway that short electric range will be eaten up quickly and you'll rely on the thirsty petrol engine alone. It’s pretty fun on a twisting country road too, if not quite as engaging or exciting as a BMW M340i or 330e – both of which can be had for similar money. The Peugeot’s lightweight steering and spongy brake pedal are partly responsible for this. That said, the combination of petrol and electric means there's plenty of punch when you put your foot down, and you rarely find the car struggling to combine the two sources of power when you need it. The low-slung driving position and small steering wheel do a great job of tricking you into thinking you're driving something smaller and sportier, and so long as you don't push too hard in corners it takes quite a lot to shatter the illusion. That said, it's definitely happier in wider sweeping bends where you can comfortably carry more speed, rather than tight, twisty stuff where you start to feel its size and weight. Space and practicality Space and practicality The 508 PSE has a big boot, but the driving position is a bit strange and headroom in the back is tight If you’ve never driven a modern-day Peugeot, you might find the layout of its controls a bit odd on first acquaintance. The steering wheel is tiny, and fairly low set – if you’re particularly tall, you might feel as though it’s almost sitting in your lap. Because of its small diameter you look at the digital instrument binnacle over the top of the rim, which feels odd for those not used to it and can mean drivers with long legs who mount the wheel high won’t be able to see the instruments. But aside from this important quirk, adjustability is good. You can bring the steering wheel in close to your chest, and the electrically operated seats are comfortable and impressively supportive. You sit reasonably low in the Peugeot, which adds to its sporting feel. If you’re used to a more raised driving position, you might not like this so much. There’s a decent amount of storage space in the cabin – and certainly enough to accommodate any random odds and ends from family holidays. The two cup holders just ahead of the front armrest are a good size, and the front door bins are large enough to hold a regular-sized flask easily enough. The glove box is pretty small, mind. Back seat space is a bit of a mixed bag. Taller passengers will find they’ve got loads of leg- and kneeroom, but the sloping roofline that gives the 508 its sporty looks means there isn’t much headroom. You’d struggle to get an adult passenger comfortable in the middle seat, too. Fortunately, back seat passengers are well catered for in terms of practicality, just like those up front. The door bins back here won’t hold a solid flask, but the cupholders in the fold-down armrest will. There are pockets behind front seats for things like books and iPads, too. Kids should fit back there just fine, though, and there are ISOFIX seat anchors on the outside seats. Although the 508 PSE might look like a sporty four-door coupe, its hatchback-style boot means there’s plenty of space for your luggage. The boot has 487 litres of capacity with the 60:40 split-folding rear seats up, and 1,537 litres if you fold them down flat. That’s considerably more than you’ll get in a BMW 330e (375 litres) or Volvo S60 Recharge (391 litres). There’s not much of a lip to navigate, and beneath the flat floor there’s a decent-sized cubby where you can store your charging cables. There are a handful of tie-down points, a 12-volt socket and a single hook to hang things like shopping bags too. Oh, and the tailgate is electrically operated. And if you need even more storage space, you can also get the 508 PSE as an estate, which has a larger 530-litre boot. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories Peugeot 508 PSE brings the wow-factor and is generously equipped, but the infotainment system could be more responsive Trust the French to absolutely nail the look and feel of the 508 PSE’s interior. The standard car already provides a solid foundation, with its strong focus on plush materials and soft-touch plastics, but this sporty version takes things a step further. Vivid yellow/green stitching complements the dark leather and suede seat upholstery very nicely, while glossy black and silver trim finishers really give the cabin an upmarket look. The stepped dash design, which sees the air vents and digital instrument binnacle positioned a level above the infotainment system, adds to the car’s enveloping, sporting feel too. It’s a bold design for sure, but also one that makes sure all of the car’s important buttons and switches are still within easy reach of the driver’s seat. Everything feels well screwed together too, which is always a good thing. As a range-topping performance model, the 508 PSE gets a lot of infotainment tech as standard. The 10.0-inch touchscreen is packed with useful features such as satellite navigation, Bluetooth connectivity and DAB radio. It’s used to display the feed from the 360-degree parking cameras, and can mirror your smartphone thanks to the inclusion of Apple CarPlay and Android Auto . The graphics are sharp, and the display is easy to read; but it can sometimes take a bit of time to respond to your inputs. Still, it’s a pretty easy system to operate. Those piano key-style shortcut buttons that run along the bottom border are a big help in this respect, although we’d still like to see physical dials for the dual-zone climate control system. You get a wireless charging pad for your smartphone, and there are handy USB ports in both rows. The high-end Focal sound system is also really impressive, and is a great way of masking the road noise created by those big 20-inch alloys. MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax The 508 PSE is available with just one power option, but it’s a bit of a firecracker. You get a regular turbocharged petrol engine and two electric motors, all of which combine to produce a hefty 360hp. Because there's a motor at each end, you also get all-wheel drive grip. So it’s a quick car, then. Peugeot claims it can accelerate from 0-62mph in 5.2 seconds, and it feels every bit as fast as that suggests. It’s only available with an eight-speed automatic transmission, so it’s a very easy car to drive around town and it's pretty clever at shifting gears when you're driving enthusiastically. The 12.4Wh battery is good for a claimed electric range of 34 miles, which is a tiny bit more than pre-2023 cars but nothing significant. We saw closer to 15-20 miles from a full charge – be aware that a bit of cold weather can have an effect here. That figure is also less than what you’d get from alternatives such as the BMW 330e and Volvo S60 Recharge, which means the 508 PSE will cost more in benefit-in-kind tax if you’re planning on running one as a company car . Still, you can charge the battery up fairly quickly. Plug in to a 7kW home wallbox and you’ll get it topped up in 1hr 45mins, while a standard three-pin socket will do the job overnight. Provided you make a point of charging it regularly, you should be able to significantly cut your monthly fuel bill. Safety and security Safety and security When the Peugeot 508 was safety tested by Euro NCAP , it was given the full five-out-five stars. It did particularly well in the adult occupant section with a 96% rating, while its child occupant score of 86% is still pretty good. As well as all of the usual driver assistance technology, such as automatic emergency braking and an active bonnet, which helps protects pedestrians in the event of a collision, the 508 also has blind spot assist, lane assist and traffic sign recognition as standard on all versions. The PSE gets some choice extras, though, such as night vision to alert you to potential hazards ahead when driving after dark, while the addition of the Drive Assist Pack Plus means you get adaptive cruise control and lane positioning assist to help you maintain your speed and position in the lane on the motorway. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems Peugeot has done a great job in terms of reliability in recent years, and this extends to the 508. Owner satisfaction surveys indicate that things rarely go wrong, and while the plug-in hybrid engine is one of the company's newer units, it appears to be free from significant problems. Giving you further confidence should be the fact that the 508 comes with a three-year, unlimited mileage warranty. This is a similar timeframe to other manufacturers, but most also impose a mileage limit. The hybrid's battery has a separate warranty, which lasts for eight years or up to 100,000 miles."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/peugeot/rifter,Peugeot Rifter Review & Prices,"€35,209",6/10,new,"Is the Peugeot Rifter a good car? Is the Peugeot Rifter a good car? The Peugeot Rifter is a boxy shaped family car that gives you loads of interior space and a huge boot, as you would expect from a car that’s based on a van. But if you’re expecting the Rifter’s interior to have the pizzaz of the Peugeot 3008 SUV’s cabin, you’ll be disappointed because there’s none of that car’s smart design or use of eccentric fabric trims. No, in the Rifter you get loads of hard plastics with the odd flash of colour to stop things looking too miserable. The small steering wheel and instrument binnacle that sits above it are nods to the i-Cockpit style design you get in other Peugeot cars, as is the infotainment system that sprouts out the top of the dashboard in all but entry-level Access models. The touchscreen’s prominent position and decent size make it fairly easy to use even when you’re driving, and the sat-nav’s directions are easy enough to follow. You even get separate ventilation controls so you don’t have to go hunting through menus just to turn up the fan, as you do in a Peugeot 308 . There are more compelling reasons to choose the Peugeot Rifter over a 308, though, and the most obvious is its generous interior space. You get loads of room up front and all models offer adjustment to ensure you get a comfortable driving position, whether you’re tall or small. It’s just a shame the seats themselves aren’t very supportive. A similar accusation could be made of the back seats, which have loads of head and leg room but feel a little too upright to be comfortable for your passengers on long journeys. Mind you, the rear sliding doors give you great access, plus its width and flat floor mean you can carry three adults without anyone feeling short of elbow or foot room. Wait until 2019 and you’ll also be able to choose a seven-seater model, which really does have space for seven tall adults. Whichever model you choose, interior storage is also very impressive. The Peugeot Rifter gets the door bins and cup holders you’d expect of any family car and to those it adds handy features such as a deep cubby between the front seats – big enough for several two-litre bottles of water – train-style overhead storage and a large lidded box on top of the dashboard in addition to the regular glove box. The practical theme continues when you get to the boot – its huge opening, boxy shape and lack of a load lip make it simple to pack and it should easily swallow a family’s luggage for a fortnight away. Head onto the road and you’ll find the Rifter’s boxy shape doesn’t just make it practical, the raised driving position also gives you a decent view out – although the large pillar around the windscreen can hide cyclists when you’re pulling out of junctions. Parking isn’t an issue, though, because mid-range models and above come with reversing sensors as standard. Automatic emergency brakes are also standard and, if you do lots of town driving, it is also worth considering the smooth-shifting optional eight-speed automatic gearbox. It suits the relaxed way you tend to drive the Peugeot Rifter, which suffers from plenty of body roll in bends. Slow steering – despite the tiny wheel – doesn’t exactly encourage spirited driving but, if you feel the need, the Peugeot goes where you point it and has plenty of grip. Surprisingly, it’s actually on the motorway where the Rifter’s van DNA is at its most obvious – at a cruise there’s quite a lot of wind and engine noise, and no models could claim to have an excess of horsepower for fast motorway overtakes. Having said that, the 110hp Blue HDi diesel is quick enough for most people’s needs and should happily return fuel economy of more than 60mpg. The 110 PureTech petrol’s nippier performance makes it a better bet if you’ll mostly drive it in town and it will be more frugal than a petrol SUV of a similar size. In fact, the Rifter’s low price and huge interior mean it’s arguably a better family car than any SUV for the same money, but only if you can live with its boxy looks and stodgy image.

https://www.carwow.co.uk/peugeot/108-top,Peugeot 108 TOP Convertible Review and Prices,"€15,894",6/10,new,"The Peugeot 108 TOP is a soft-top version of the compact 108 city car that comes with a partial fabric roof. Just like the hard-top 108, it shares many components with the Citroen C1 and Toyota Aygo, but – in addition to a folding roof – it comes with front and rear doors as standard. Besides its folding fabric roof, the Peugeot 108 TOP interior looks identical to the standard 108. You get an equally minimalist cabin with only the bare minimum of buttons for the heating and ventilation and top-spec cars get equally eye-catching striped seats. Unlike the standard 108, the Peugeot 108 TOP comes with a seven-inch touchscreen with smartphone mirroring as standard. Also fitted across the range is a height-adjustable drivers’ seat to help you find your ideal seating position. There’s enough head and legroom for you to get comfortable if you’re over six-feet tall, too, but rear-seat passenger space is far from impressive. Sure, you get front and rear doors as standard, but there’s less head and legroom in the two back seats than you get in the likes of the VW Up and the Skoda Citigo. Having a folding roof doesn’t affect the Peugeot 108 TOP’s practicality, but it still can’t carry a great deal in the boot. There’s space for a pair of small suitcases, but that’s pretty much it. You can fold the two back seats down to carry more, but a bike won’t fit unless you remove its wheels. Chances are, though, you won’t be considering a compact convertible because you want to carry lots of luggage. You’ll be more interested in cruising along with the top down. Unfortunately, while the Peugeot 108 TOP is a doddle to drive, it isn’t particularly comfortable. It’s noisier than the standard car at speed, too, and its 1.0-litre petrol engine is sedate to say the least. The Peugeot 108 TOP isn’t what some would call a ‘true’ convertible, but its folding fabric roof still lets you enjoy the wind in your hair Accelerating from 0-62mph takes more than 13 seconds, and versions fitted with the optional automatic gearbox take even longer. That said, at least it’s cheap to run. With a gentle touch on the accelerator, you should be able to manage more than 50mpg in normal driving conditions. The Peugeot 108 TOP is very easy to manoeuvre around town. You don’t get parking sensors or a reversing camera as standard but the Peugeot 108 TOP’s small size and light steering mean it’s dead easy to park and the relatively large windows make it easy to spot your way through tight gaps in traffic. Unfortunately, some key safety kit that helps prevent avoidable accidents – such as automatic emergency braking – costs extra across the Peugeot 108 TOP range. But, if you’re looking for an affordable soft top that’s cheap to buy and cheap to run, it’s certainly worth a closer look."

https://www.carwow.co.uk/peugeot/508,Peugeot 508 Review & Prices,"€54,896",7/10,new,"Is the Peugeot 508 a good car? Is the Peugeot 508 a good car? If you need a large family car , but don’t want to be go for the boring side of sensible just yet, the Peugeot 508 could be the model for you. If a Volkswagen Passat is a smart shirt-and-chinos combo, the 508 is more of a sharp Givenchy suit, probably worn by a model smoking Gauloise outside a Left Bank cafe. It’s tres cool. And an update in 2023 means it's even better looking than before. The ultra-slim headlights blend into daytime running lights that look like they've been etched by a claw strike from a big lion. The grille blends into the bodywork, which is a unique look, while the rear LED lights have a new design with three angled lines. But while its stylish five-door hatchback/saloon/coupe body looks great – and there's a more practical yet still very fancy-looking 508 SW estate version, too – the back seats are noticeably more cramped than in alternatives such as the Skoda Superb or Volkswagen Passat. It's an appealing option in a dwindling selection of saloon-style models, though; former options such as the Ford Mondeo and Vauxhall Insignia have been dropped due to falling sales. Okay, so you might have to put up with a few complaints from tall passengers in the back, but you certainly can’t accuse the Peugeot 508’s interior of being boring. Its dashboard design is far more interesting than most alternatives and all models come with two large infotainment screens that make the cabin look bang-up-to-date. If you’re more interested in old-fashioned, solid build quality, however, the Peugeot 508 might not be the car for you. It’s certainly not terrible, but the Peugeot’s materials don’t feel as consistently brilliant as those in a Skoda Superb. But driving the Peugeot 508 feels much sportier than pottering about in the Skoda thanks to the 508’s low-set driving position. Not everyone will be a fan of its small steering wheel, though. The boot isn’t the biggest – look to a Superb if that is what matters most to you – but the 508’s large hatchback door makes loading bulky items relatively easy, even if you do have to lift them over a slight boot lip. So, the Peugeot 508’s practicality might not be particularly impressive, but if you’re considering a sporty-looking saloon car , you’ll likely have more than a passing interest in how it drives – and you won’t be too disappointed. The Peugeot 508 is fun to drive down a twisty road, but also manages to smooth out bumps quite effectively too. There's also a sporty Peugeot Sport Engineered (PSE) version if you want more ability in the bends. The 508 isn’t quite so clever when it comes to autonomous driving tech, however. It’s available with active cruise control and lane assist , but these systems aren’t as sophisticated as those you’ll find in a Volvo V60 . The engine lineup is limited now to one petrol and one hybrid , plus a more powerful hybrid system in the sporty PSE. The entry-level engine is a 1.2-litre petrol with 131hp that gets up to 50mpg in official tests. However, for ultimate fuel economy, you can drive around 40 miles on electricity alone with the 225hp plug-in hybrid engine. You'll have to keep the batteries topped up and drive like a saint to achieve its official 274mpg economy figure, though. There will be no saintly driving in the other plug-in version, the 360hp 508 PSE. Think of it as the 508’s answer to the BMW M340i in that it's sportier than the regular model, but it's not supposed to be a hardcore performance car. Other family cars are better built and more spacious, but if that all sounds a bit too ‘pipe and slippers’ for you, then the 508’s stylish design and fun drive make it worthy of a place on your shortlist.

When it's time to sell your current car , carwow can help with that, too. How much is the Peugeot 508? How much is the Peugeot 508? By and large, the Peugeot 508 is priced sensibly for a mid-sized family saloon. It’s a little more expensive — model for model — than the Skoda Superb and loses out badly in terms of space. Then again, the Peugeot is a much more stylish and chic-looking car than the Skoda, so if style matters to you, you won’t feel too badly done by. The 508 is also much, much more affordable than the Volkswagen Arteon , which is possibly its most similar car in conceptual terms, being as it’s also a low, sleek four-door that’s kind of pretending to be a coupe (frameless doors and all). The 508 holds an almost £10,000 price advantage over an Arteon and you’ll feel pretty upset paying that premium when you twig that the Arteon is just a VW Passat with fancy bodywork. Peugeot would also like to think that the 508 is stylish enough to compete with the likes of the BMW 3 Series , and if you go along with that then it’s a few grand cheaper than the cheapest 320i. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort The Peugeot 508 is pleasant to drive and is comfortable over rough roads, but it's not as sporty as its coupe-like styling suggests In spite of the 508’s steeply angled windscreen, and its low and sporty driving position, the view out of the front is actually pretty good. What’s less good is the chunky windscreen pillar, which you end up having to crane your head around to make sure you’re not about to flatten a cyclist. The rear view is also pretty dreadful, with a tiny rear window and massive pillars at the back. There is a parking camera, and on higher-spec versions you get an all-round ‘top-down’ camera too. The 508 gets an eight-speed automatic gearbox as standard, which is good because it is smooth and easy to use — especially around town. You do get gear change paddles but there’s an annoying delay between clicking them and the gearbox actually doing anything. Standard models have suspension that feels a bit firm around town, but that improves a lot if you upgrade to the optional adaptive suspension. The plug-in hybrid version is very good around town thanks to being able to run on nice, smooth electric power for up to 42 miles, and all versions have light steering and a reasonable turning circle so parking’s not too hard. If you’re doing lots of motorway miles, go for the petrol engine because it’s pretty frugal, even though it feels a bit underpowered on bigger roads. The plug-in hybrid can get quite thirsty on long runs because you will drain the battery pretty quickly. If you're a very high-mileage driver you might find the diesel offered on pre-2023 update models will be a better option, though you will have to buy used. Refinement is generally good, and surprisingly given the frameless door glass, there’s not a lot of wind noise. You will hear a bit of tyre and road roar, but that’s about it. The suspension feels smoother on bigger roads, but there is still an annoying ‘whump’ if you hit a pothole, and it reverberates up through the bodywork, which isn’t nice. The 508 does come standard with lane keeping steering and cruise control , but you have to upgrade to the GT model to get radar-guided cruise control. Both systems are good, but not as sharp in their reactions as some rivals, although rather nicely the lane-keeping assist can be programmed to keep you to one side of the lane, leaving space for motorbikes and cyclists. How thoughtful. The 508’s small steering wheel will always be slightly controversial, but it does make the steering feel quite sharp and reactive. However, that’s a bit of an illusion, because the Peugeot isn’t built to corner quickly. Once you're tuned into the small wheel, you realise it's actually quite lazy in the way it responds to your steering inputs, which encourages a more laid back driving style. It’s not as sporty as it initially feels, nor as sporty as it looks. Is it leading you on with that styling? Maybe a bit, but overall the 508 is still a pretty good thing to drive. If you want very, very good then check out the 508 PSE. This comes only as a plug-in hybrid with 360hp, four-wheel drive, and a chassis tuned by the people who make Peugeot’s Le Mans racing cars. It’s pretty awesome in the corners, with way more grip and poise than the standard 508. It is very pricey, though. Space and practicality Space and practicality The boot isn't as big as the Skoda Superb and rear seat space is poor, but front seat practicality is better The 508 gets useful storage space in its big, sweeping centre console with a lidded cubby that can take a mobile phone, and two good-sized cupholders behind the gear shifter. Actually slightly too good-sized — they’re a bit deep for a small coffee cup. There’s another big storage bin under the butterfly-style armrest, and the door bins are fine, if a little bit shallow. There’s also another open storage area under the centre console, down by your knees. Down there, you’ll find a wireless phone charger and two USB sockets but it’s kind of hidden from view and it’s quite hard to reach anything that’s stored down there. The glovebox, as is traditional for right-hand-drive Peugeots, is tiny to the point of being useless. Things are much less impressive in the back seats. In fact, the 508 is pretty cramped and you really pay for that racy roofline. The door opening is a decent size, so wrestling a child seat in and out is fine (and you do get ISOFIX in the back and in the front passenger seat, albeit the anchors have really awkward zipped covers) but rear headroom for tall passengers is pretty awful. Worse, Peugeot has stuck the rear coat hook up by where the rear passenger’s head will be, so it’s useless if you have someone in the back. Legroom is actually okay, but there’s nowhere under the low-set front seat to put your feet, and the seat base is quite short and low-down, so under-thigh support for taller passengers is poor. Three people in the back? It is possible because the transmission hump isn’t too big, but the headroom for the centre seat passenger is poor and the seat itself is narrow, so it’s a thumbs down. The rear door bins and seat-back nets are small too, but at least you do get two USB sockets for those in the rear, and an armrest with cupholders. Maybe use those for a rechargeable light, as it’s pretty dark in the back. You also need to watch the rear doors — shove them open with a bit of force and they spring back suddenly on the hinges. Speaking of doors, in spite of the frameless side glass, the rear doors have a fixed rear quarter light which stays in place when the side glass is wound down, and which not only looks awkward, it also really gets in the way if you’re trying to squeeze in or out in a tight parking space. The 508 fastback’s 478-litre boot is OK, but it’s dwarfed by the massive 625 litres you’ll get in a Skoda Superb. Impressively, though, the 508 doesn’t lose boot space if you go for the plug-in hybrid version as the battery is cleverly packed away so it doesn’t intrude. There is a slight load lip for the boot, but it’s not too bad, although the parcel shelf is really annoying. It’s a fixed, two-part shelf which is a faff to remove, and when you do there’s nowhere in the car to store it so you just have to leave it at home or abandon it in the bushes. Under the boot floor, there is a space-saver spare wheel but if you delete that you can have some under-floor storage. You get the expected tie-down points, luggage hooks, and a 12-volt socket, of course. Folding down the 60:40 split rear seats is annoying, as there’s no lever in the boot to do it, so you have to go around to the rear doors to flip them down. They don’t sit fully flat, which is also annoying, but at least you do get a continuous floor so you can slide heavy items all the way in. There’s also a load-through flap in the rear armrest, but it’s pretty narrow so of limited use unless you’re a skiing enthusiast. If you need more practicality, the handsome 508 SW estate has a 530-litre boot. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories The cabin looks stylish with some fancy materials, but build quality isn't fantastic and the infotainment is still a little behind the best in class It’s fair to say that the 508’s cabin is as stylish on the inside as the rest of the car is on the outside. It’s maybe lost its shock value a little, as Peugeot has repeated its style in the likes of the more affordable 2008 crossover and the 308 hatchback, but that multi-layered dash, with its imitation carbon-fibre panels still looks striking and it’s very different to what anyone else is doing. Certainly, it makes the Skoda Superb and Volkswagen Arteon feel very plain inside. Quality is pretty good, as all of the upper surfaces are made of nice soft-touch materials and you get nice contrast stitching if you go for optional leather. You will find cheaper plastics low down, though, and when Peugeot does cheap plastics it really does cheap plastics. The front seats are very comfy at first, but, if you're tall, they can feel a bit short on support for your legs on a very long journey. And if you are tall, you’ll probably feel more comfortable with the low-set, small steering wheel and high-up instruments, but shorter drivers will need to crank the seat up to be able to see over the steering wheel rim, which kind of spoils the low-slung, sporty effect. The 508 comes as standard with a 12.3-inch digital instrument display which has a few different layouts, including one which puts the sat-nav screen right in front of you, which is handy. There’s even an optional ‘night-vision’ camera, which automatically displays a forward view from an infra-red camera at night. It sounds like a gimmick, and kind of is, but the camera can see further than the headlights so there is a safety benefit. In the centre of the dash, there’s a standard 10.0-inch screen, which is a nice upgrade on the old 8.0-inch screen found in lower trims. It gets a row of lovely ‘piano key’ shortcut buttons underneath, which bring you straight to important screens such as the air conditioning and sat nav, but the menu layout is still fiddly and we’d much rather have some physical buttons for the climate controls. There are some further shortcut buttons for the heating and ventilation further down, but if you want to just adjust the fan speed, you’ve got to go in through the touchscreen which means taking your eyes off the road for too long. As of 2023, you get the latest graphics and menu designs, which are a huge improvement on before and a bit easier to use. Easier still is Apple CarPlay and Android Auto , which are included as standard, so you don't need to use the built-in sat nav and audio systems, though there’s the option of an ear-busting stereo by French audio expert Focal, which is great. Not so great? The USB port for connecting your phone is under the centre console on the left, for French drivers, not on the right for us Brits, so it’s pretty awkward to find. There are some other neat features, such as a system that automatically adjusts the cabin lighting and air con to either calm you down (when you’re being frustrated by traffic) or wake you up (such as half way through a long journey) and you can have (very noisy) massaging seats, which aren’t quite as lovely as they sound but which can help you avoid a numb bum on a long run. MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax If you’re looking at this from a tax perspective then the plug-in hybrid is the clear winner. With official CO2 emissions of just 33g/km meaning that company car user-choosers will pay just 14 per cent in Benefit In Kind tax if they go for one. As a private buyer, you’ll pay very little first-year road tax before reverting to the standard rate after that, though the PSE model faces an extra charge in years two to six because it's above the £40,000 threshold. Peugeot’s claimed electric range on a full charge is up to 42 miles, which is decent but it’ll probably be more like 30 miles in real-world conditions. It’s also put in the shade by the claimed 53 miles that the Volvo V60 PHEV can cover on electric power alone. You can charge the 508 PHEV quickly enough, in around one hour and 45 minutes from a 7kW home wallbox. Like all PHEVs, the 508 does get thirsty on a long run, but it’s not the worst in this regard — you should be able to average close to or better than 40mpg. The high-performance PSE version will only do a claimed 34 miles on electric power when it’s fully charged, and you’ll be looking at more like 30-35mpg on a long run. It still has impressive 40g/km official CO2 emissions though. The basic 1.2-litre three-cylinder petrol turbo engine has an official economy figure of up to 50mpg, but around 40mpg in real world conditions would be more like it. CO2 emissions of 127g/km mean a reasonable first year road tax cost. Safety & security Safety & security The 508 put in a very impressive performance when it was crash-tested by Euro NCAP back in 2018. Aside from the full set of five stars for its overall performance, it scored a 96% rating for adult occupant protection, albeit a slightly less impressive 86% for child occupant protection. Standard safety spec includes a pop-up bonnet, to protect a pedestrian in the event of an impact and automated emergency braking to help stop that happening in the first place. You also get standard electric child door locks, and tyre pressure monitoring. There’s also a distance alert, which warns you if you’re getting too close to the car in front, an intelligent speed limiter, cruise control, and lane-keeping aid. However, if you want more than that you’ll have to trade-up. Allure Premium models come with blind spot monitoring, driver attention alert, automatic high-beam headlights, radar-guided cruise control with traffic stop-and-go, and an upgraded lane-keeping assistant. Only the top-spec PSE version gets the night vision camera as standard. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems Peugeot has done very well in recent years in surveys of reliability and ownership satisfaction, so the 508 is a solid bet for reliability. Although the hybrid engines are fairly new designs, the 1.2 petrol is a long-serving engine, and shouldn’t have any major gremlins left. The 508’s build quality is good, but inside you’ll notice that some surfaces and some of the switches and buttons don’t quite have the solidity that you’d find in a Volkswagen or a Volvo , so while there have been no major reports of unreliability, they may not hold together quite so well in the longer term. The 508 has been recalled a few times; for engine management software updates, for rear suspension problems, and for problems with the roof-rack fixing points. Peugeot gives the 508 a three-year warranty, which has unlimited mileage for the first two years, but which is restricted to 60,000-miles in the third year. You can extend the warranty of your 508, or any Peugeot, for a fee as long as it’s less than 10 years old and has fewer than 100,000-miles on the clock."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/peugeot/508-sw,Peugeot 508 SW Review & Prices,"€56,300",8/10,new,"Is the Peugeot 508 SW a good car? Is the Peugeot 508 SW a good car? The Peugeot 508 SW proves that spacious estate cars don’t have to be boring. Compared with the chinos-and-shirt looks of the Volkswagen Passat Estate and Skoda Superb Estate , the 508 SW is as stylish as a Parisian model in a Givenchy suit smoking a Gauloises outside a Rive Gauche cafe. Unlike many estate cars, the Peugeot 508 SW doesn’t play second fiddle in the looks department to its four-door sibling. Sure, its upright back end isn’t quite as slinky as the standard 508 ’s sloping roof, but it comes with some unique Peugeot lettering on the boot lid, a subtle roof spoiler and some lovely frameless doors which are sure to attract attention from nosey neighbours. An update in 2023 means it's better looking than ever. There are new slim headlights with three vertical claw-like daytime running lights and a cool front grille that blends into the bodywork. And if prying eyes get close enough to examine the Peugeot 508 SW’s interior, they’ll be just as impressed. The simple, minimalist dashboard, high-mounted digital driver’s display and gorgeous piano-key-style switches look more like they belong on an uber-luxurious limousine than a practical family car . The infotainment system isn’t as easy to use as you’d hope, however, but at least it comes with sat nav and smartphone mirroring so you can use your phone’s navigation and music-streaming apps instead of Peugeot’s own programs. Sadly, no amount of fancy phone integration can make up for the cheap, scratchy plastics you’ll find lower down on the Peugeot 508 SW’s doors and centre console. These aren’t dealbreakers, but you’ll notice them each time you reach down to put something in the door bins or adjust your seat. On the subject of seats, you won’t have much trouble finding a comfortable driving position – even if you’re very tall. Just as in the standard 508, the 508 SW comes with Peugeot’s iCockpit system – essentially a small steering wheel and a raised digital driver’s display – that takes a bit of getting used to, but it feels more intuitive in the 508 SW than in most other Peugeots. You might have to adjust your driving position so the wheel doesn't block the dials, though. Unfortunately, while space in the front seats is good, tall adults may find the Peugeot 508 SW’s back seats a little cramped. There’s enough knee room for two six-footers to sit behind equally tall people in the front, but there’s very little shoulder room if you need to carry three in the back at once. It isn’t particularly easy to fit a child seat either, but at least there’s space in the Peugeot 508 SW’s boot for a family’s luggage for a week away or – if you fold the back seats down – a bike with its wheels attached. A Skoda Superb Estate’s boot is bigger though. For low fuel bills over long distances, pre-2023 cars had a frugal (if rather noisy) diesel engine. However, now you only have the choice of petrol or plug-in hybrid . If you spend most of your time on the motorway the petrol should offer lower running costs However, city dwellers will prefer the hybrid. It costs a fair bit more to buy than the petrol, but you could make that back over time thanks to its low low fuel bills, provided you’ve somewhere to charge it up. With a full battery, the 508 can go about 30 miles on electric power. There’s also a super-quick sporty version of the hybrid called 508 PSE (Peugeot Sport Engineered), which has 360hp but at a cost that will convince you there’s a typo in the price list. On the motorway, you’ll find the Peugeot 508 SW cruises along quietly and comfortably at speed. You'll have to get the pricey PSE for adaptive suspension as standard, which helps iron out bumps in Comfort mode and makes the 508 SW feel more fun to drive in its Sport setting. It's also available as an optional extra on top-spec GT versions. However, even then, it doesn’t quite turn the 508 SW into a sharp, nimble sports estate, and the fake engine noises that get piped through the car’s speakers do little to improve the illusion. Don’t let this put you off, though – especially if you prefer your estate cars relaxing rather than sporty. To that end, the Peugeot 508 SW also comes with a smooth eight-speed automatic gearbox as standard in all models and plenty of active safety kit to help prevent avoidable accidents. This all helps make the Peugeot 508 SW a practical family estate that’s very easy to live with and pretty stress-free to drive. It isn’t as much fun as some sportier alternatives, but when it comes to style, it’s streets ahead of the current crop of drab-looking estates. So if you fancy yourself a chic estate, check out the latest Peugeot 508 SW deals to see how much you could save through carwow. You can also browse used Peugeot 508 SW models as well as an extensive stock of other used Peugeots . And if you want to sell your car online , carwow can help with that too. How much is the Peugeot 508 SW? How much is the Peugeot 508 SW? The Peugeot 508 SW is pretty competitively priced with other family estates of similar size. The cheapest Volkswagen Passat Estate costs a little more than the cheapest Peugeot, while the most affordable Skoda Superb Estate costs a bit less. With plenty of equipment as standard, the 508 SW is good value. You won’t need to spend lots on extras or look beyond the basic Allure model for a good selection of creature comforts and comprehensive safety kit. If you want to keep the list price as low as possible, the 131hp petrol is considerably cheaper than the plug-in hybrid. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort The Peugeot 508 SW is comfortable and relaxing to drive, but despite its sporty steering wheel, there are more enjoyable estates to point down a winding road You can no longer buy a Peugeot 508 SW with a manual gearbox unless you shop for a used example. That’s no great hardship around town, where an automatic makes life easy in heavy traffic. What’s not so easy is your view at junctions or while reversing. The thick front pillars create big blindspots, and you won’t see much over your shoulder through the small rear windscreen. Fortunately, the 508 SW comes with parking sensors front and rear and a rear-view camera, even on the basic Allure model. Light steering helps with low-speed manoeuvres, as does the small steering wheel, and at low speeds it's pretty comfortable over bumps. The standard suspension can fidget a bit, especially on larger alloy wheels, but high-spec cars with adaptive suspension are pretty forgiving of urban lumps. To keep emissions right down, you can choose one of the plug-in hybrid cars . The less powerful of the two will travel up to 34 miles on electricity alone, so plenty of school runs and commutes can be completed without any exhaust emissions. As well as being good for local air quality, it’s a quiet and relaxing way to get around. Change lanes and put your foot down to accelerate up to 70mph and the gearbox can be a bit slow to respond. It’s not so much of an issue with the hybrids, as electric power takes up a lot of the slack, but you do notice a pause with the petrol and diesel models. The diesels that Peugeot has dropped from the range were ideal for motorway miles. Now, you'll probably want to stick with the petrol engine if you regularly do longer distances. It doesn't quite pack the same punch that the diesels did, but it gets up to speed quickly enough and is quiet at higher speeds. If you want to feel like there’s some power in reserve at motorway speeds, either of the plug-in hybrids has a lot more power than the combustion-engine-only car. However, you'll drain the batteries quite quickly, so if you can't charge very regularly you might find economy is worse than non-hybrid models. You do get a bit more wind and road noise than you’d hear in a Volkswagen Passat, but not enough to really get on your nerves. The range-topping 508 SW Peugeot Sport Engineered is a bit of an outlier in the range. It’s so much faster, both on the straights and through the bends that it feels like a completely different car. Other 508 SW models are competent enough on a twisty road, but don’t approach a B-road with the same relish. The Peugeot is better suited to boulevards than B-roads. Play around with the optional adaptive suspension in a GT-spec car and the 508 SW handles well, but it never offers the kind of engagement that a BMW 3 Series Touring owner takes for granted. On standard suspension, comfort rather than agility is what you can expect – it’s not a car to put a smile on the face of press-on drivers. Space and practicality Space and practicality Front seat passengers get a decent amount of space, but the rear seats are a touch cramped and alternatives have bigger boots Slide behind the wheel and the first thing you notice is the steering wheel. It’s tiny, and looks like someone has fitted a wheel from a games console for a bet. It feels weird at first, but you do get used to it, so long as you can position it to be comfortable and see the instruments – not everyone can. You look at them over the wheel rather than through it as you do in most other cars. Peugeot calls this the iCockpit, and it’s a bit of an adore-déteste feature. The driver and front passenger’s seats are height adjustable on all models, and also get lumbar adjustment as standard. The front of the seats can be extended for more under-thigh support on GT spec and above. That funny little go-kart steering wheel adjusts for height as well as moving in and out, so folks of most shapes, heights, and sizes should be comfortable. Storage is pretty good with the exception of the glovebox, which is tiny because it’s half-filled by the fuse box. But the door bins are big, and there’s a large space under the driver’s armrest. As you’d expect, there are two cupholders between the front seats. The rear seats don’t offer as much space as you’ll find in the VW Passat Estate or Skoda Superb Estate, but whether that matters really depends on how tall your passengers are. Headroom is much improved compared with the 508 Fastback saloon-styled model, and there’s enough legroom for average-sized adults. However, more space for feet under the front seats would make it easier to really stretch out, especially for tall passengers. There are ISOFIX mounting points in the two outer rear seats, and in the front passenger seat. However, they’re behind zips, which makes them fiddly to use, and the sloping roofline makes for a narrow door opening through which to lift a bulky child seat. Some estate cars are all about practicality. Some sacrifice space for style. If you’ve read this far you’ll know the 508 SW is definitely in the latter camp. That’s clear when you look in the boot. In isolation it’s a practical space, and there are lots of hooks and tie-downs to make the luggage area more useable. But a capacity of 530 litres is nothing to get excited about when the Skoda Superb Estate offers a cavernous 660 litres and the VW Passat isn't far behind on 650 litres. If you need more room, the rear seat backs fold forwards. They don’t quite lie flat though, so there’s a slight slope to the floor. Still, it's a useful 1,780 litres of space, though this is again some way behind the Skoda's 1,950 litres. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories There's plenty of high-end style and material quality, but the small steering wheel takes a little getting used to and the infotainment isn’t the most user-friendly The 508 SW is all about offering a less boring, more stylish alternative to the massed ranks of humdrum estate cars. That’s evident in the look of the cabin as well as the handsome exterior. We’ve mentioned the iCockpit already. Setting aside any issues with seeing the instruments clearly, it does give the cabin a really sporty look and feel. That’s somewhat at odds with the driving experience in all but the PSE version, but if the cabin of a Volkswagen Passat makes you yawn with boredom then the Peugeot is certainly very different. We really like the piano-key style shortcut buttons for the infotainment. They’re useful and good-looking. The standard of finish is high, so long as you look at the top half of the dash and doors. Lower down you’ll find harder, scratchy plastics and cheaper-looking materials, but you can say much the same of most family estate cars. Look over the steering wheel and you’ll see a 12.3-inch digital instrument panel. The driver can configure the display with different themes and to show different information. It adds to the smart and high-tech vibe. The 508 SW now gets a 10.0-inch infotainment display as standard. It's a decent upgrade on the old 8.0-inch unit that came as standard before the 2023 update, boasting crisp, clear graphics and fast response to your touch. It’s still not the best system, though. Yes, the shortcut buttons are handy but the menus aren't the most intuitive to navigate. You have to use the screen to adjust the air conditioning, which is a faff compared with pressing a real button. No doubt most owners will plug in their smartphones and use Apple CarPlay or Android Auto , which are both standard. MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax With just two engine options to pick from, plus the sporty PSE version, choosing your engine is easy. For most people, the petrol is probably your best bet. It’s not the quickest of cars, but it’s affordable to buy and still delivers reasonable economy. Official figures suggest up to 50mpg is possible, but you can expect more like 40mpg in normal, mixed driving. You would have to decide whether the considerable up front extra cost of the hybrid could be offset by lower running costs, which largely comes down to whether you have access to charging to keep the batteries topped up. If you’re a business driver choosing from a company car list, the 225hp plug-in hybrid is the smart choice. Because of its low emissions (23-33g/km) and ability to travel on electricity alone, it sits in a low benefit-in-kind tax band. You'll pay 14% compared with 31% for the petrol. The high-performance PSE is also a good choice for company car drivers for similar reasons, but otherwise the high list price makes it hard to justify, even though it’s very economical for such a quick car. Be aware that if you buy a 508 SW costing over £40,000, you’ll have extra Vehicle Excise Duty to pay in years two to six. Safety and security Safety and security When the safety experts at Euro NCAP tested the Peugeot 508, it scored the maximum five stars. This was the Fastback model, but the SW should be every bit as safe. The 508 earned a 96% score for adult occupant protection, 86% for child occupant safety, 71% for pedestrian protection and 79% for its safety assistance systems. All models come with an active bonnet to keep pedestrians away from the engine in a collision, and a lane assist system to steer the car towards the centre of the lane if it starts to drift. Security kit includes an alarm with a tilt and lift sensor. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems A few years ago, Peugeot didn’t have a great reputation for reliability, but in recent years the brand has improved a lot. It’s finished near the top of some customer satisfaction studies, and the latest models are a lot more durable than Peugeots used to be. If something does go wrong with your 508 SW, all new Peugeots have a three-year warranty. Mileage is unlimited for the first two years but capped at 60,000 miles in year three. That’s pretty much in line with industry standards, but you’ll have a longer cover if you choose a Hyundai , Kia or Toyota ."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/peugeot/traveller,Peugeot Traveller Review & Prices,"€30,404",5/10,used,"Is the Peugeot Traveller a good car? Is the Peugeot Traveller a good car? The Peugeot Traveller is a large van-based MPV with up to nine seats, but running costs comparable to a regular car. It’s an alternative to the Mercedes V-Class and Hyundai i800 . As soon as you see the Traveller, it’s obvious that it has its roots in a van, but that’s not a problem. On the contrary, it has the distinct benefit of allowing buyers to choose from a variety of arrangements. That means that not only can you pick from different seating arrangements – covering both the number of seats and how they’re laid out – you can also choose between two different lengths of vehicle. As you can probably guess, the Traveller’s large, boxy exterior means that it has a massive amount of space inside for passengers – far more than in a conventional MPV . And, if you remove all the rear seats – which is not easy, as they’re pretty heavy – you can have a colossal luggage capacity of as much as 4,500 litres to play with. Again, it’ll come as no surprise that there’s a van-like air to the materials, but the design and equipment are reminiscent of what you’ll find in a Peugeot car. So, among the toys that are available are DAB radio, smartphone connectivity through Apple CarPlay and Android Auto , dual-zone climate control and a 7.0-inch touchscreen. You can even get a head-up display that projects info – such as current speed – onto the windscreen, as well as a reversing camera. Overall, if you’re upgrading from a family hatchback , you’ll find the standard equipment is decent, but not particularly generous for the price. You get cruise control, parking sensors and air-conditioning, while radar-guided cruise control, automatic city braking and an 180-degree camera are notable options. Despite the tall body and the high seating position, driving the Traveller is fairly easy. It’s surprisingly manoeuvrable and the soft suspension means that you won’t feel too many bumps. Ultimately, though, you can never forget that you’re driving something that’s basically a van. On the motorway, the Peugeot’s brick-like aerodynamics mean it suffers from more wind noise than conventional, car-based rivals such as the Ford Galaxy . And, when you turn into a corner, there’s a lot of body roll. Just as unsurprisingly, the only engines available are diesels, but what will probably come as a surprise is that the smallest unit is just a 1.5-litre unit. Naturally, it doesn’t get the Traveller moving all the quickly, but it has the advantage of the lowest CO2 emissions and the best fuel economy in the range. If you’re likely to be using the Traveller more heavily laden, then it’s worth considering one of the stronger engines, both of which are 2.0-litre units. They give progressively stronger performance, but the price you pay are increasingly high fuel consumption and emissions. If you have a particularly large family or regularly have to move lots of people, then the Traveller could be the right car for you. But, the likelihood is that most people will find a more conventional MPV or SUV suits them better and will cost them a fair bit less to buy and run.

https://www.carwow.co.uk/peugeot/308-gti,Peugeot 308 GTi Review and Prices,"€35,837",6/10,new,"The Peugeot 308 GTi is the hot hatch version of the French firm’s small family car. It’s an alternative to the likes of the SEAT Leon Cupra and Volkswagen Golf GTI that comes with a minimalist cabin and a spacious boot, as well as a surprisingly powerful little engine. In keeping with that minimalist theme, from the outside, there’s not much that distinguishes the Peugeot 308 GTi from other 308s. Well, not without hitting the options list, that is. There are a few red trim pieces in the front bumper, as well as lowered suspension and twin exhaust pipes. But, if you want something that stands out a bit more, you can pay extra for the ‘Coupe Franche’ paint job – a two-tone finish that makes the 308 GTi stick out like a sore thumb. Inside, meanwhile, there are plenty of features that set the GTi apart. So, you sit in figure-hugging Alcantara and leather sports seats that hold you firmly in place in tight corners. You also get aluminium pedals, metal kick plates and lots of red stitching. Unfortunately, while the interior looks nice and modern, it doesn’t feel anywhere near as solid or as upmarket as a Golf GTI or Leon Cupra. The infotainment system is also rather disappointing, as it isn’t particularly intuitive to use and the sat-nav can be tricky to follow. On a more positive note, there is lots of room for adults in the front, along with plenty of space to store odds and ends. Sadly, the rear seat isn’t so accommodating, as there’s noticeably less kneeroom than you get in a Golf. It’s a case of so near, yet so far, for the 308 GTi. It’s very close to being a great hot hatch, but it’s not quite on the money When you open the boot, though, you can see what’s happened. It looks like Peugeot has sacrificed some passenger space to allow for a bigger boot, as the 308 GTi’s boot is huge. It has more than enough space to carry a large baby buggy or four suitcases with room to spare. And, with the seats down, there’s significantly more space than you get in most alternatives. Just as impressive is how much power the Peugeot 308 GTi’s relatively small 1.6-litre engine can produce – 262hp – and how much pulling power it delivers at relatively low revs. This means the car responds quickly and feels eager, without the driver having to constantly change gear. It also helps make the Peugeot 308 GTi quicker than the VW Golf GTI. The 308 GTi gets from 0-62mph in just six seconds – that’s almost half a second quicker than the German machine. Given the stats, it’s a shame that the Peugeot’s pokey engine doesn’t sound any more exciting. Admittedly, you can hear its likeable burble and the pops during full-bore gearchanges from the outside, but precious little of that noise makes its way into the cabin. Running costs are impressive, though, with claimed fuel economy of 43.5mpg, although in normal driving conditions, you’ll more likely to see a figure in the mid- to high thirties. That’s on a par with the Golf GTI, but unfortunately the 308 doesn’t feel quite as agile or as sure-footed as the likes of the Golf GTI and Leon Cupra. This issue is somewhat compounded by the 308 GTi’s rather soft suspension, which wallows and bounces around more than a Leon Cupra, Megane RS or Golf GTI on bumpy country roads. The Peugeot 308 GTi was built to beat its namesake from Volkswagen, and in many ways it does. But it can’t match the Golf’s breadth of talents or the way that the Golf feels special even in the mundane cycle of daily life."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/peugeot/e-5008,Peugeot E-5008 Review & Prices,"€60,577",8/10,new,"Is the Peugeot E-5008 a good car? Is the Peugeot E-5008 a good car? There are very few seven-seater electric SUVs on sale at the moment, and the majority of them are really rather pricey. Like a pair of Zara jeans, the Peugeot E-5008 looks just as stylish as its more expensive alternatives, but for a fraction of the price. Considering that the E-5008 is over £10,000 less than the Kia EV9 , it looks like pretty good value, and it’s around £35,000 less than the Volvo EX90 ; yet the Peugeot might just be the more stylish car. Much like its smaller E-3008 counterpart, the E-5008 is one of the most striking cars on sale - period. It's a kaleidoscope of crisp lines and sharp corners, with an enormous grille and the signature lion claw headlight design. It may not have the swoopy roofline and compact rear end of the E-3008, but the E-5008 has just as much road presence - and a lot more practicality. Range: 310-414 miles Efficiency: 3.5 - 4.3mi/kWh Battery size: 73kWh, 97kWh Max charge speed: 160kW Charge time AC: 4hrs, 20-80%, 11kW Charge time DC: 30mins, 20-80%, 160kW Charge port location: Left side rear Power outputs: 210hp, 230hp, 320hp The interior carries the angular theme into the car, with a fabric-trimmed wraparound dashboard, slick 21-inch widescreen infotainment-and-instrument display and a funky two-spoke steering wheel beneath it. The infotainment display isn’t just good to look at, but it’s fairly easy to use too. A secondary display underneath the air vents has customisable touchscreen buttons, while there’s another row of haptic controls beneath it. It’s just a shame that all of the shortcuts direct you back to the main screen, because while you can use Peugeot’s own infotainment at the same time as the climate controls, you have to totally exit Apple CarPlay or Android Auto to change the temperature. Frustrating. What isn’t frustrating is just how practical the E-5008 is, with lots of storage around the cabin and plenty of space across the front two rows. Tall adults won’t struggle for headroom or legroom behind a tall driver, for example, and up front there are two cubbies in the centre console as well as a wireless charging pad for your phone. Unfortunately the third-row of seats isn’t all that spacious, and it’s best reserved for children or short journeys. You’ll fit six adults under six-foot across all three rows, but it’ll feel a little claustrophobic in the back after a while. While it’s not an EV, the Volkswagen Tayron has more space inside. As a seven-seater, you still get some cargo space - about the same size as a small hatchback - which will easily take some shopping or a few backpacks. With the third row of seats stowed away there’s an enormous 915-litre boot; long trips away will be no bother with that much space for luggage in the back. Long trips away are a real option in the E-5008 too, because you have a claimed 310 miles of range in the single and dual-motor small battery models. That shoots up to a very impressive 403 miles in the bigger battery, long-range car, and the E-5008 is an excellent choice to take on a long road trip; it’s exceptionally quiet and comfortable on the move. Around town it’s easy to manoeuvre for its size, and its suspension does a superb job of absorbing bumps and blows, but it’s on the motorway where it impresses most with minimal wind and road noise and a pillowy-soft ride at speed. Country lanes aren’t fun though, even in the dual-motor model with its firmer suspension, and while the E-5008 feels capable it’s best driven along at a steady pace. As a practical, comfortable and stylish family car it makes for a strong contender, and we’ve got some great new Peugeot E-5008 deals here on Carwow. We’ve also got Peugeot E-5008 lease deals , and there are used Peugeot E-5008s available through our network of trusted dealers. For something a little smaller, check out other used Peugeots on sale, and when it’s time to switch, Carwow can even help you sell your car . How much is the Peugeot E-5008? How much is the Peugeot E-5008? The E-5008 is very affordable when compared to its large SUV alternatives from Kia and Volvo , but it's far more expensive than its petrol and hybrid alternatives such as the Volkswagen Tayron (around £40,000) and Skoda Kodiaq (around £38,000) You’ve got two trim options to choose from, starting with Allure and moving up to GT. Allure cars are rather well equipped as standard, with the super-widescreen 21-inch display, wireless phone charging, three-zone climate control, 19-inch diamond cut alloy wheels and keyless entry. GT cars feature gloss black exterior trim and a gloss black roof, adaptive cruise control, intricate LED headlights, heated seats and steering wheel and sunblinds for the rear side windows too. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort The E-5008 makes for a good cruiser, but its spongy brakes let it down no matter the road For a big car, the Peugeot E-5008 is really easy to drive around town. Your view out of the back isn’t amazing, but you get good visibility out of the front and the excellent panoramic camera view means tight turns are no issue. The steering is light, and Peugeot’s small steering wheel means that the E-5008 feels agile around tight bends. There are a couple of downsides, with the first being the brakes. They take some getting used to because of an odd dead spot at the top of the pedal’s travel. There’s also no one-pedal mode, so you regularly have to use the brakes to come to a stop, rather than simply letting the regenerative braking take control. Long motorway trips are a breeze in the Peugeot E-5008, because the suspension soaks up bumps nicely to make for a comfortable ride, and there’s very little in the way of wind and road noise either. However, it’s not the most efficient EV, so you’ll probably be stopping more often than you’d like on a long trip. We saw 3.0 miles per kWh in the single-motor car, which would equate to about 220 miles between charges. It’s not particularly punchy for an EV either, so you have to put your foot down on a slip road to get up to speed. Allure models only get basic cruise control, so you’ll have to step up to GT models (or pay for an option pack) if you want the adaptive system that can maintain your distance to the car in front. Big, comfy SUVs are usually great on the motorway but a bit rubbish on a winding country road, but the Peugeot E-5008 actually performs admirably in the twisties. The squishy suspension means it can wallow around a bit over larger humps in the road, but this means it’s not too unsettled by poor surfaces while you’re in the middle of a turn. It’s a generally satisfying thing to drive around corners. High-performance dual motor cars are notably quicker thanks to the extra motor on the rear axle, and while they feature stiffer suspension than on the standard cars the odd brakes are a let down when you’re trying to get a hustle on. Space and practicality Space and practicality Boot space is really good, but the third row seats are a bit tight and there’s no front boot You get the classic quirky Peugeot driving position in the E-5008. There’s a small steering wheel that could take some getting used to but does make the car feel quite sporty, and the driving position is comfortable, but it’s worth checking that your view of the dials isn’t blocked by the wheel. Unlike most cars it’s designed for you to look over the top of the wheel instead of through it, so you might find that your ideal seat position means you can’t see your speed, range or other important information. Storage is pretty good in the front, with large, felt-lined door bins to stop things rattling around and a useful space beneath the armrest. The cupholders can take a big bottle, but the glovebox is tiny. There’s a wireless smartphone charging pad tucked beneath the dashboard, which is standard on all models, but you also have two USB-C slots if you want a wired connection. The second row seats are nice and roomy, with plenty of legroom in their standard configuration, though you can move them back and forth to make more space for the third row or open extra boot space. It’s a bit tight for three though, particularly when it comes to headroom for those on the outer seats. Unlike many EVs, the floor isn’t too high, so you get good under-thigh support from the seats, and you can fit your feet under the seats in front. Coupled with the fact these seats also recline, it’s easy to get comfortable. Practicality is okay, with decent door bins, cup holders in the centre armrest and shallow nets to hold smaller items. It’s not quite the same story in the third row. Access is pretty easy and headroom is good, but legroom is really limited and the seat cushion is quite close to the floor, so it’s difficult to really relax. There’s not much in the way of creature comforts either, save for a cup holder on each side. You get ISOFIX mounting points in the outer second row seats, but considering this is a big family car it’s a shame there aren’t any in the front passenger seat, nor in the third row like you get in a Kia EV9. With all seven seats in place, you get a boot capacity of 348 litres. That’s about the same as a Volkswagen Golf , which sounds good, but because a large chunk of that capacity includes the under-floor storage, unless you utilise this space the reality doesn’t feel quite as useful as the figures suggest. That said, it’s about on par with alternatives with all seven seats in place; the Kia EV9 gets 333 litres, the Tesla Model Y has 363 litres and Volkswagen ID Buzz has 306 litres. Fold the third row and the Peugeot E-5008 comes into its own, with a 916-litre boot space. That’s nearly double the Mercedes EQB ’s 495 litres, and still comfortably beats the Kia EV9 (828 litres) and Tesla Model Y (753 litres). The Peugeot is only beaten by the ID Buzz, which has 1,121 litres thanks to its boxy van-like shape. It’s a bit of a shame that you don’t get a front boot in the E-5008. The Tesla Model Y is the best in this regard, with 117 litres under the bonnet. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories Cool design and quality materials are let down a bit by a laggy infotainment system First impressions of the Peugeot E-5008’s interior are excellent. You get a sort of retro lounge-inspired design, mixed with ultra-modern touches such as the large screens dominating your view ahead. Materials feel pretty good with fabric across the dashboard and lovely Alcantara-trimmed seats on the GT version. There are some cheaper plastics lower down but nothing that should put you off at the price, and everything feels solid. For example, the indicator stalks are nicely damped and have a proper premium feel, which sounds like a small thing but is a nice touch considering you use them all the time. The super-futuristic dashboard looks good at first glance, with a massive 21.0-inch ultra-wide screen sat beneath a sweeping pane of glass that’s split between the infotainment touchscreen and the instrument dials. It looks good, but the infotainment software isn’t quite as snappy as it should be, and the menus can be quite confusing to find your way around. One neat touch is another screen beneath the main display with touch-sensitive configurable buttons for shortcuts. It’s a neat solution that could be quite useful if you take the time to set it up properly. Electric range, charging and tax Electric range, charging and tax Single-motor E-5008s have 210hp and a 73kWh battery that returns 310 miles of range in official tests, though it’s not the most efficient system so you can expect 200-250 miles in the real world, depending on the weather and your driving style. Long-range cars have a much larger 93kWh battery and a smidge more power to make up for the weight, as well as an impressive 410-mile official range, but otherwise feel identical to the base-level car. Dual-motor cars are notably quicker thanks to an extra 110hp on the front-wheel drive models, but it will only go so far as 289 claimed miles. Speaking of which, charging speeds are okay but not the best – you get a maximum charge rate of 160kW, which provides a 20-80% top up of 30 minutes. The EV9 has a peak of 210kW and can do the 10-80% charge in 24 minutes, while the Tesla Model Y takes 27 minutes with a peak of 250kW. As with all electric cars, you get the lowest possible benefit in kind tax rate , and the typical £10 first year and standardised rate for new electric cars from year two onwards. It’s a shame the E-5008 falls over the luxury car tax threshold as it costs over £40,000, so you’ll be paying a hefty sum between years two and six. Safety and security Safety and security The Peugeot 5008 earned four out of five stars in Euro NCAP testing in 2025, which is a bit disappointing for a family car. It scored over 80% in its occupant tests, but its poor 63% safety assistance score is what let it down; surprising given its standard kit. Standard safety tech includes driver attention alert, lane keeping assistance, and an advanced emergency braking system that uses radar to detect pedestrians and cyclists at night. Upgrading to the GT model adds adaptive cruise control, while both models can add a long range blind spot monitor and rear cross traffic alert as part of an option pack. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems As a new model there’s not been enough time to work out how reliable the Peugeot E-5008 will be. However, Peugeot placed an impressive sixth out of 32 car manufacturers in the 2024 Driver Power ownership survey , which should be reassuring. The E-5008 gets Peugeot’s standard warranty , which is three years of cover with unlimited mileage. Electric models also get an eight-year/100,000-mile warranty specifically for the main battery, which guarantees it will retain at least 70% of its capacity in this time. Hyundai offers a more competitive five-year warranty, Kia offers seven, and both Toyota and Lexus cars can be had with up to 10 years of warranty with regular annual servicing at a main dealership though."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/peugeot/308,Peugeot 308 Review & Prices,"€41,939",8/10,new,"Is the Peugeot 308 a good car? Is the Peugeot 308 a good car? The Peugeot 308 could be right up your street if you want your next family hatchback to really stand out in a sea of restrained-looking alternatives such as the VW Golf and Ford Focus . It's like taking all your practical work clothes and updating them with sparkly accessories. Just take a look at that front end. It looks like Peugeot’s taken the 308 and dipped it face-first in a bucket of leftover Christmas decorations. Shiny daytime chrome, bright running lights and LED lamps are everywhere, along with a brand-new shield-shaped Peugeot badge. Somehow, though, these bits of car jewellery work together to make the 308 look more upmarket than most other small family hatches , such as the Skoda Octavia or SEAT Leon . It’s a similar story at the back, where Peugeot has added some bright red brake-light slashes to the bootlid and a set of shiny chrome exhaust trims to the bumper. Although, peer closer and those square pipes are just plastic add-ons. Thankfully, there’s little of this fakery inside the Peugeot’s cabin. If a surface looks nice (and most of them look terrific) it’ll almost certainly feel equally plush, too. This applies to everything from the soft dashboard trim and the solid centre console, and to the flashy metal-effect trim around the air vents. These vents sit right at the top of the dashboard, beside a high-mounted driver’s display that replaces old-fashioned analogue dials. This looks very similar to the setup you get in the smaller 208 and larger 3008 SUV , and means you peer over the steering wheel to read your speed rather than through it. The steering wheel itself is much smaller than in most cars and sits in your lap rather than at arm’s length. It’s an odd layout that’s tricky to get a good driving position with. Very lofty passengers might also struggle slightly to get comfy in the Peugeot 308’s back seats, but there’s plenty of space for kids to get comfy and the boot can easily swallow a family’s luggage for a weekend away. Speaking of which, the Peugeot 308 is comfortable to drive for long periods, and cruises along happily at motorway speeds. If long drives are a common occurrence, you’ll want to check out the 308’s 1.5-litre diesel engine. It’s not particularly pokey, but is mostly quiet and returns around 50mpg in normal driving conditions without any great effort. If you aren’t planning any particularly long road-trips, you’ll be better off with one of the 308’s petrol or plug-in hybrid engines. There's also an electric version, called e-308 , so you really can have it whichever way you please. The 1.2-litre petrol has more than enough power for town driving and country roads, while the hybrid is nippier and more economical – so long as you have somewhere to charge its battery up regularly. Both versions are easy to drive, quiet and comfortable. All Peugeot 308s are easy to see out of and the dinky steering wheel helps make light work of tight inner-city manoeuvres. Speaking of which, every version comes with rear-parking sensors as standard and you can pay extra for higher-spec cars with adaptive cruise control to help take the sting out of long motorway trips. That said, even entry-level cars come with plenty of equipment as standard, which helps justify their slightly steeper price tag than some less flashy family hatchbacks. If you’re looking for something that’ll stand out but don’t fancy a high-riding SUV , then the new Peugeot 308 is well worth a look. If you’re keen on this stylish family car, you can check out Carwow’s Peugeot 308 deals to see how much you could save. You can also browse the latest used 308s as well as other used Peugeots from our network of trusted dealers. Carwow can help you sell your car , too. How much is the Peugeot 308? How much is the Peugeot 308? The Peugeot 308 impresses inside, outside and on the road and this quality is reflected in the price. Compared with others in this segment, the starting price is marginally higher than the Volkswagen Golf and more expensive than the Ford Focus. The 308 range itself features four grades, starting with Active Premium. For an additional £2,000, buyers can get into an Allure, which adds in front parking sensors (in addition to the standard rear ones) and powered folding mirrors. The Allure Premium costs an extra £1,000, but includes a lot of extra tech, such as a wireless charging and adaptive cruise control. Finally, the GT starts at £30,030, but gets bigger wheels, leather steering wheel and sport suspension. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort The setup of the 308 makes it great transport either in town or on the motorway, although it’s not as much fun as a Ford Focus One of the most useful functions in the 308, specifically the plug-in hybrid model, will be the regenerative braking function. One-pedal braking functionality isn't quite possible – the system might slow the 308 down to almost a stop, but you still have to press the pedal for the final bit. When you do, they are a little bit over-sensitive, which can take some getting used to. Peugeot claims up to 37 electric miles are possible, so it’s important to make the most of them and eek them out as much as possible, especially if you’re concerned about fuel costs. However, if you push the accelerator too hard, the engine kicks in and you’re back burning fuel again. The steering is nice and light, which helps when moving around town, especially when getting in and out of parking spaces or tackling tight spaces or mini roundabouts. Visibility is pretty good all around the car – another important attribute in town where drivers could be faced by cyclists, pedestrians or other vulnerable road users. At low speeds, the 308 is pretty comfortable – the suspension ensures limited body movement when going over bumps, for example. The hybrid system is 300kg heavier than the standard internal combustion engined car, which means the ride quality feels a bit more solid, but not enough to make a huge impact on what is a good level of ride comfort. The turning circle of 10.5m doesn’t quite match that of other smaller cars, such as the Mini or Fiat 500 , but it’s not far off. Plus, it’s much better than its peers in this class such as the Volkswagen Golf and Ford Focus. Given the engine options of the 308, the diesel is probably still the one to go for if you’re doing a lot of motorway miles. The hybrid will allow you to run in electric mode here, but the driving range on batteries alone will be limited. On the motorway, the 308 really impresses. It’s quiet and the seats are comfortable, meaning that long journeys won’t leave you lethargic at the end. The addition of automatic cruise control and lane keeping technology in mid-range 308s and above will be welcomed by drivers doing big mileage. Plus, the Peugeot has the technology that will change lanes for you on the road, simply when you indicate to move in a specific direction. The small steering wheel creates a feeling of sportiness in the 308 and the driving experience does back that up. The steering is nicely weighted and direct when going into corners. It might not be as engaging or fun to drive as a Ford Focus, but is not dull by any stretch. There’s plenty of grip from the 308’s tyres and it inspires confidence when cornering at relatively high speeds. The suspension does its job well when pressing on, which means that the car doesn’t get out of shape and passengers will be comfortable as you go through the bends. Space and practicality Space and practicality There is a premium feel to the 308’s cabin, but this does mean the ISOFIX points are neatly hidden zipped up pockets, which makes them more difficult to access There is a lot of storage and practical additions in the 308, especially in the central tunnel in the front of the car. Here you will find a space under the dashboard, USB charging and 12V power ports as well as a charging pad for your smartphone. There’s enough space for fairly large bottles to be stowed in the two centrally mounted cupholders, which are covered by a sliding panel to again keep things neat and tidy. Likewise, under the armrest there’s another storage bin with an integrated USB port. The gear lever is also integrated into this section. It’s fairly small, but effective and sits flush with the rest of the trim, providing a smooth layout and a neat design. The door bins are a decent size and can easily carry large bottles or other relatively bulky items. Another plus point is the glovebox, which is much bigger than in Peugeots of old. It’s even lined with felt for an extra touch of quality. Overall there’s a premium feel to the inside of the car, which is sure to impress a lot of buyers and might even persuade people out of more premium models here such as the Audi A3 . There’s not a huge amount of space in the rear of the 308, but it’s not too bad a squeeze for passengers travelling behind the front row. While there’s limited leg and knee room, most occupants won’t be touching the seats in front. When it comes to head room, it’s a similar story, and those who are looking for more space around them should check out the Skoda Octavia. While it is possible to travel with three adults across the back seats, it’s not the most comfortable, which is something to bear in mind if travelling longer distances. Meanwhile, there are ISOFIX points for child seats as standard, but they are hidden behind zipped covers. On the one hand it keeps things neat and tidy, but on the other, they are a bit tricky to access. But the door opening is quite wide, so getting an actual seat in and out is very straightforward. Another positive is the large rear windows, which let in a lot of light and also help visibility from the front. Elsewhere on the storage angle, there is some space for slim items such as laptops or tablets in the front seat backs and the rear door bins match the front in offering plenty of space for bottles. In between the rear seats, there’s a pull-down armrest with two cupholders but, as there’s no tab to pull it down, it’s not the easiest to access. There’s also a ski hatch that enables long items to be carried in the 308, but the opening is fairly compact, which will limit what can actually pass through the gap. At 412 litres, there’s more boot space in the 308 than in a Ford Focus, Volkswagen Golf and lots of other similar hatchbacks. It’s also a sensible square space, which means that uniform square or rectangular items can fit in easily. There is a bit of a step down to the floor from the boot line and the distance added by the wide bumper might be a bit of a hindrance when moving heavier items. Under the floor there is additional storage, although there is 50 fewer litres in the hybrid model, compared with the petrol or diesel 308. Folding down the rear seats is easy and can be done from standing behind the boot. That opens up a huge load area that is relatively flat. The ridge where the seats fold isn’t necessarily a deal breaker, but it does mean that sliding items right to the back of that area – to just behind the front seats – is made a bit more difficult. There are also nets and tie-down points in the boot too, however there’s a lack of 12V socket here, unlike almost every other car on the market! Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories There’s a premium feel to the 308 that is arguably the benchmark in this sector, but the smaller steering wheel – which gets in the way of the driver display – might put people off The interior of the 308 is superb, with a great design culminating in a swooping clear dash stretching across the width of the car. There’s a nice mix of quality materials, most of which are soft to touch and give the car an air of quality. Choose the range-topping GT and you'll benefit from a leather steering wheel, for example. It’s above and beyond what is offered in the Volkswagen Golf, which, for so long, has been the benchmark among hatchbacks. However, opinions will be divided when it comes to the dash layout – Peugeot has opted for a small steering wheel that is slightly squared off. For many, it won’t just be the shape that is an issue, more the fact that it gets in the way of the dials behind it. But it adds a more sporty feel to the car and there is plenty of manual adjustment in all directions. The large central infotainment screen is standard across the range. It is clear, responsive and easy to navigate. A panel at the bottom of the screen makes navigating the different areas of the system straightforward. The menu ‘buttons’ are touch sensitive, but they are quick to react to inputs. Many people will choose to bypass the system and plug in their phone, and there is a specific button to enable Apple CarPlay or Android Auto in the 308. That large screen is susceptible to dirty fingerprints getting left on it though, so be prepared to dedicate a bit of time to cleaning it. While it might not impact on the view of what is being displayed on the screen, the prints are fairly noticeable in certain lights. Underneath that panel there are also physical buttons for the car’s features that are used most often. They include interior temperature and front and rear screen demisting/heating. MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax There’s plenty of choice when it comes to engines for the 308, with electric, petrol, diesel or hybrid on offer. The petrol option is a 1.2-litre with 131hp, while the 1.5-litre diesel offers the same amount of power. The hybrid options see a 1.6-litre turbo petrol engine working alongside an electric motor, which provides either 180hp or 225hp, depending on which version you choose. If CO2 emissions are a major consideration, the hybrid is the obvious choice, as it emits just 25g/km, which means you pay no road tax in the first year, and company car buyers get the lowest benefit-in-kind rate in the range. Elsewhere, the petrol engine’s rated at from 128g/km, while the diesel is 117 or 119g/km. All models have automatic transmissions and are all front-wheel-drive. Safety and security Safety and security It’s a four-star Euro NCAP crash test rating for the 308, which doesn’t quite match the Volkswagen Golf or the Ford Focus, which both scored maximum five-star ratings. Where the French model falls short is in adult occupant safety (76%), with child occupant protection faring a little bitter and recording a score close to that of the Golf and Focus (84%). Vulnerable road user protection and safety assist ratings were 68% and 65% respectively. In terms of frontal crash protection, there is a full complement of airbags and belt pretentioners and load limiters. No knee airbags are offered, however. In lateral crash protection, there are side airbags for head and chest, although not in the rear for the latter. Autonomous emergency braking is standard to protect vulnerable road users and for car-to-car protection, and all models feature lane keeping assist technology. Another standard feature across the range is a Thatcham category 1 alarm with anti lift sensor. Also, the hazard lights are automatically deployed upon heavy braking, to alert other road users of potential dangers. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems All 308 models are covered by the industry standard three-year/unlimited mileage protection. To date – largely because it is a new model – there haven’t been any recalls on the 308, but that could change as previous models have been subject to issues. Previous versions of the 308 – and other Peugeot models – paint a mixed picture of the car’s quality and reliability levels. Industry surveys have recorded mediocre scores, but that’s not to say the same fate will await the latest model."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/peugeot/408,Peugeot 408 Review & Prices,"€45,642",8/10,new,"Is the Peugeot 408 a good car? Is the Peugeot 408 a good car? The Peugeot 408 is the car you buy when you just can’t decide between a sleek saloon and a chunky SUV , as it’s basically the half-way point between the two. It has some of the ground clearance and plastic cladding of an SUV, but the low roofline and sleek shape of a saloon, and it kind of looks like an elephant has sat on a Lamborghini Urus . All of this means that it’s a bit tricky to work out where the 408 fits among alternatives you might be considering. The Honda Civic is around the same price, but the Peugeot is roomier. The Skoda Octavia is much more practical, but also much more conventional. Perhaps the semi-SUV likes of the Cupra Formentor and Renault Rafale make for a better comparison, as does the Citroen C5 X , which shares a chassis and engines with the 408, and which is similarly tricky to pigeon-hole. It’s almost daring in its style, but not all of what’s on show works. We like the pert rear end with the built-in spoiler, and the expressive headlights, but some of the chunky SUV-bits lower down on the body look quite awkward. Equally, if you go for the basic 17-inch alloy wheels, the 408 can look as if it’s been fitted with the wheels from a supermarket trolley — go for the optional 19-inch rims, or even the 20-inch wheels. The front end is pretty striking, with the body-coloured grille and the slashing LED running lights, but even so it’s hard to see the 408 as a coherent whole — it’s like lots of different cars all mixed into one, and they’re all fighting for supremacy. The cabin is a much quieter affair, and it shares a lot with the likes of the Peugeot 308 hatchback. The 408 does seem to have had a boost in quality though, and with the sweeping layout and the high-quality materials, you’d not be disappointed if you hopped out of a Volkswagen , or even an Audi , and straight into a 408. The infotainment system is good, too, thanks to a layout that’s easy enough to find your way around. There’s a handy set of digital buttons, which are shortcuts to the functions you need, and you can customise the layout of those shortcuts to your taste. There’s also wireless connections for Android Auto and Apple CarPlay , but it’s still annoying that you have to go into a separate on-screen menu for the climate control. Bring back buttons, please. The front seats are really good, but you should definitely take a test drive before buying as not everyone can get their driving position to match up with Peugeot’s small steering wheel and high-set instruments. The wheel is supposed to sit low down, while you look at the instruments over the top, but you might find that the wheel gets in the way of some of the dials. Space up front is decent, with storage areas under the armrest and door bins that are lined to avoid rattles. There are two big cup holders, and space in the back is surprisingly good, even with that low roof. It’s a little narrow, though, so the 408 is really a four-seater, as the middle rear seat is close to useless. You can choose from two plug-in hybrid versions, which should appeal to company car buyers with their low official CO2 ratings, but the company car tax system is changing this year, so business buyers might be better off waiting for the all-electric E-408 to arrive, with its 280-mile range. There’s also a basic 1.2-litre petrol hybrid version, which isn’t as powerful but feels sweeter to drive than the PHEV versions simply because it’s lighter. Given the 408’s ride height, you’d expect it to have a softly-softly SUV-style way over bumps, but it’s actually surprisingly stiff. It’s fine around town, but there’s a good bit of noise from both the suspension and the tyres on bigger roads, which makes the 408 less comfortable when cruising. The standard hybrid is slightly better off in this respect than the plug-in versions, which again is mostly down to its weight.

How much is the Peugeot 408? How much is the Peugeot 408? As fits its somewhat mixed-up nature, the 408 is reasonably affordable at the lower end of its model range, with a basic Allure-spec hybrid matching the Cupra Formentor for price, but it’s a far more spacious and practical car than the Cupra. It’s also considerably cheaper than the entry-level Renault Rafale, but the Rafale has much more power as standard, and is more of a traditional SUV in shape. If you want to be rather more practical about it, an entry-level Skoda Superb saloon is roughly the same price as a basic 408, and while the Skoda is neither as dramatic to look at, nor quite as sharp to drive, it absolutely wipes the floor with the Peugeot in space and practicality terms. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort Select electric mode and it’s very quiet and refined, but low-speed comfort and high-speed road noise disappoint The Peugeot 408 looks a long way from an agile sports car, so you might be expecting a relaxing, comfortable ride. However, while it handles potholes and speed bumps pretty well, it’s unsettled over rough, poor quality Tarmac. You regularly feel rumbles through the wheel, which can be irritating, though the petrol version was much more composed over bumps. It’s a shame, because when you sit in the hybrid 408, see its classy cabin design and pull away in electric-only mode, it gives off a quiet, refined vibe. There are also normal and sport modes that utilise the petrol engine, but the electric mode cuts any use of the engine, so long as you have enough battery charge left. The brakes are fine when you give them a light press, but as you push your foot down further they suddenly get quite grabby. This can make it difficult to make smooth progress. Visibility is decent looking forward, but looking out the back you’ll struggle to see much at all. The sloping bodywork looks funky from the outside but it means the rear window is small, so you’ll be relying on the cameras while reversing. The latest version of the 225hp plug-in hybrid gets a bigger 16kWh battery, which means it now has a maximum claimed range of up to 52 miles, but you’ll most likely see about 35-40 miles in the real world. Comfort is fine at higher speeds but it’s here that the intrusive road noise becomes apparent. Wind noise is minimal but the roar from the tyres is noticeable. Our test car’s 19-inch wheels are likely partly to blame, with smaller wheels usually being quieter, if less aesthetically pleasing. The plug-in hybrid engine works pretty well getting up to motorway speeds, but it’s not seamless. There’s the initial punch from the electric motors, then as that runs out of puff the engine is waiting for its turbos to spool before really pushing you on to 70mph. The petrol doesn't have the same punch as the hybrids as it lacks the electric motor backup, but it will get you up to speed swiftly enough. The gearbox can be a little lethargic in responding when you start accelerating, but once you're on the move the engine thrums quietly away as a happy motorway cruiser. The advantage of that stiffer suspension is noticeable when you get to some corners. Where you expect a bit of lean there isn’t, so you’ve got more confidence than you might expect when things get twisty. The steering wheel is tiny and makes the most sense here as it almost tricks you into thinking you’re in a dainty sports car. Almost. In the hybrid, plonk the car in Sport mode and the engine stays on so you get the full petrol-electric experience all of the time. It makes the 408 feel more responsive, and while the Cupra Formentor is more fun still, it’s genuinely surprisingly good on a country road. The only real disappointment here is that while you can manually shift gears using the wheel-mounted paddles, the car still takes over and shifts up or down when it thinks it’s necessary. Space and practicality Space and practicality The 408 is practical in the cabin and boot, but the chunky rear bumper can make loading and unloading items awkward There’s plenty of space for those in the front, and it’s easy to get yourself in a good position thanks to plenty of adjustability in the seat and wheel. One potential irritant is that, for some drivers, your seating position will make the top of the wheel block the view of the dials, so it’s worth checking this before you buy. The seats are very comfortable, so long distances are a breeze. Practicality is excellent, with a large bin beneath the armrest. The top splits, so the driver can keep their arm rested while the passenger accesses the storage. There’s another small cubby in front of that and a slot for your phone beneath the infotainment system, which houses the wireless charger. The cup holders are a good size and can carry large bottles, as can the door bins. They’re also felt-lined, so anything you put in there won’t rattle around while you drive. Legroom is excellent in the back, with loads of space from your knees to the seats in front, even behind tall drivers. The footwell is also spacious and there’s a good gap beneath the seat so your feet won’t feel cramped. Headroom is okay, but taller passengers might find they brush the ceiling as it slopes to the rear. The 408 isn’t particularly wide either, so if you need three people in the back seats they’ll have to be okay with getting cosy, and the outer passengers will find their heads right up against the roof. The Volkswagen Arteon Shooting Brake is roomier for this. You get the same high quality, comfortable seats in the back as you do up front, and the same roomy door bins. They’re not felt-lined though, while the door materials feel a bit cheaper, so it’s not quite as plush in the back. The central armrest with two cup holders and a load-through chute are further plus points, though. If you need to fit a child seat , there’s loads of space so even chunky rear-facing seats can be used without the front passenger needing to put their seat too far forward. However, the ISOFIX points are tricky to locate, so getting the seat in in the first place can be a pain. The 408’s boot is a good size at 536 litres in the petrol, though that drops considerably to 471 litres in the hybrid model because the battery placement eats into space. Opt for the upgraded Focal sound system and you can knock another 30 litres off in the petrol and 20 in the hybrid. Fold the rear seats down and space increases to 1,611 litres in the petrol and 1,545 litres in the hybrid (or 1,583 litres and 1,528 litres respectively with the Focal setup). That compares pretty well with most alternatives. It’s a bit smaller than the Citroen C5 X, which has 545 litres in its petrol versions and 485 litres in its hybrids, but it’s much bigger than the Cupra Formentor, which measures 450 litres and 345 litres respectively. There’s a small lip that wouldn’t be a major problem when loading heavier items, but the chunky rear bumper means there’s a large ridge to lift items over. You might also get your jeans dirty by leaning on it. Some nice touches include a lever to drop the seats without having to lean too far into the boot, small nets to store items in, elasticated straps to hold stuff in place and various hooks and handles. Once the rear seats are folded there’s not much of a lip to push luggage over, but the seats don’t go fully flat. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories The interior is very plush and the infotainment is excellent, but it’s very dark if you don’t get the panoramic roof option Jump inside the Peugeot 408 and you’ll be forgiven for thinking this is from a brand with a typically more premium image. It feels more upmarket than other mainstream cars, such as the Skoda Superb and is even a good match for an equivalent Audi, such as the A4 Avant . That being said, regardless of brand appeal the 408 is rather expensive, so this goes some way to justify the price. Everywhere you look and touch there are high-quality materials, and while there are scratchy plastics here and there, you have to go looking for them. It’s pretty dark inside though, so we’d recommend opting for the panoramic roof if this is a worry, though it’s a £900 option and only available on top-spec GT cars. Fortunately, there’s no irritating infotainment system ruining the good first impression. There’s a 10.0-inch infotainment display as standard across the range, and it’s really easy to use with crisp, clear graphics. The highlight, though, is the programmable buttons beneath it, which let you create shortcuts to your most-used screens. That said, Peugeot still insists on keeping the climate controls within its touch screen menus, so even with shortcuts you’re always a button press away from changing the temperature. Back to the positives though, and wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are included as standard on the 408, so you’ll probably just use that anyway. The digital dials are another highlight. You get the usual speed, revs and trip information displayed digitally, but Peugeot has created a 3D-effect, which looks great. You can turn it off if you want, but we found it a nice, unique touch. There’s an optional sound system upgrade available for GT models. The 10-speaker Focal system is relatively good value at £600, which will be barely noticeable on your monthly payments but should be worth it for audiophiles. Remember that it eats into boot space a little, though. Another neat extra is night vision, which is displayed in the digital dial screen. Although you shouldn’t drive while looking at it, it can pick up on people, animals and other obstacles ahead and warn you before you even see them. MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax There are three engine options on the 408, all coming with an eight-speed automatic transmission . The range starts with a 1.2-litre hybrid petrol engine that makes 136hp and 230Nm of torque. It’s by no means quick, going from 0-60mph in about 10.2 seconds, but fuel economy of up to a claimed 58mpg means it should be cheap to run. Then there’s the plug-in hybrids. The first is called Hybrid 180 and makes 180hp and 320Nm of torque, while the second, called Hybrid 225, makes 225hp and 320Nm of torque. Both will do 0-60mph in around eight seconds and have an official fuel economy of more than 200mpg. Naturally, achieving this relies on the battery being fully charged regularly – we managed about 51mpg in the 225 in mixed driving. CO2 emissions are as low as 19g/km for the latest PHEV version, so they fall into the lowest vehicle excise duty (VED) bracket besides EVs, though some models creep into the over-£40,000 limit which you’ll have to pay an extra annual surcharge in years two to six. These emissions figures and up-to 50-mile electric-only range also mean benefit-in-kind is low for company car drivers — though with the changes to business tax the all-electric E-408 should be a more tempting option. Safety and security Safety and security Standard safety kit includes post collision safety brake, lane keep assist and automatic emergency braking. Step up to Allure Premium and you also get the Drive Assist Pack, which adds rear cross traffic alert, adaptive cruise control and long range blind spot monitoring. The Peugeot 408 has been safety tested by Euro NCAP and, perhaps disappointingly, scored four-out-of-five stars. It received 76% for adult occupant protection, where you’d expect most cars to achieve over 80% at the very least. Child occupant safety scored 84%, which is better, but it was marked down further for its safety assist systems at 65%. However, the testing organisation does note that while some additional testing was done for the 408, its score is mostly based on the ‘closely related’ Peugeot 308. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems It’s too early to tell whether there are any ongoing issues with the Peugeot 408. However, Peugeot’s reputation for reliability has been improving recently, which is reassuring. A three-year warranty is included as standard for extra peace of mind, and that’s unlimited mileage for the first two years. It’s limited to 60,000 miles in the third year, though extended warranties and service plans are available for a fee. The 408 didn’t feature in the most recent Driver Power survey, but Peugeot itself was rated an impressive sixth out of 32 brands, with 20.8% of customers reporting problems with their cars.

https://www.carwow.co.uk/peugeot/2008,Peugeot 2008 Review & Prices,"€35,638",8/10,new,"Is the Peugeot 2008 a good car? Is the Peugeot 2008 a good car? The Peugeot 2008 is a small SUV with a bold look, comprising strong colour schemes and a variety of slashes and creases that make alternatives such as the Volkswagen T-Cross look more than a little tedious. If small SUVs are more rugged versions of small cars, then the Peugeot 2008 is a 208 that’s kitted out for a paintballing trip. It has the same great tech you get in the hatchback, but is better prepared for some countryside pursuits thanks to its raised ride height. And the French flair loses no momentum when you get inside, helped by a 2023 update that saw a 10.0-inch infotainment display fitted as standard. The digital driver's display (standard on all but the base model) that sits above the teeny tiny steering wheel looks great, and has a cool 3D-effect on top-spec models that works with the fancy dashboard design to offer a neat appearance that's tough to match at this price point. Not many do better than the Peugeot for front-seat room, either. It will easily accommodate two tall adults and there’s plenty of scope to move the seat and steering wheel, though lumbar adjustment – which helps keep you comfy on long drives – is only optional on top-spec versions. Back seat space is less impressive, though. Tall passengers will have their knees brushing the front seats if they’re sitting behind someone else who’s tall. On the upside, there is plenty of head and foot room. In the boot, the 2008 has 434 litres to work with, which is better than the Skoda Kamiq and Seat Arona , but falls short of the Volkswagen T-Cross and Ford Puma . Hit the road and you’ll find the 2008 is a great all-rounder. Its steering is light in town, but weights up to give you more confidence at faster speeds. The slick six-speed manual gearbox (top-spec models get an eight-speed automatic) is the perfect match for the Peugeot’s sporty small steering wheel, though that's where the sportiness ends. It's relatively fun on a winding road, but it's happier taking things easy. The most powerful engine helps make it a bit more enjoyable, though. It has 130hp and is both sprightly and cheap to run. The manual Allure version is a bit more economical than the automatic GT, but official figures make the entry level 100hp engine the cheapest to run. But what makes the 2008 stand out from alternatives is its eye-catching styling that proves cheap-to-run and practical family cars can still be desirable. For that reason alone, it’s worth shortlisting against cars like the Seat Arona and VW T-Cross. And, of course, the 2008 is available in fully electric E-2008 form.

How much is the Peugeot 2008? As with so many cars these days, the 2008 has some close mechanical relatives. In this case, they’re the Vauxhall Mokka and the Citroen C3 Aircross . The Mokka is the most closely related to the 2008, and shares a similar engine line-up. Not surprisingly, the 2008 is priced very close to the Mokka, with the Vauxhall being fractionally the cheaper car to buy. The C3 Aircross is a slightly more distant relative, but it does use much of the same mechanical package as the Peugeot, and it’s distinctly cheaper than the 2008 — by several thousand pounds in fact, so it's worth considering. All three cars are a bit cheaper than a Ford Puma, but the 2008 is a little pricier than a Renault Captur . Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort The 2008 manages to be comfy while you're driving around, but there are some annoying blind spots and it can feel floaty on bumpier surfaces The 2008 has nice, light steering, although it does suffer from the traditional vague Peugeot manual gear change. At low speeds, the brakes feel a touch grabby, so you need to train your right foot to be gentle with them or you’ll be head-banging the steering wheel. The big, thick windscreen pillars do create some annoying blind spots, and those aren’t helped by a huge rear view mirror that leaves only a narrow gap between it and the top of the infotainment screen to look out through. What you can’t fault is the 2008’s comfort — it’s properly French car-comfy when it comes to soaking up bumps and lumps around town. It feels like a much bigger car in that respect — a feeling that’s enhanced because you sit up nice and high. The 2008’s impressive performance continues on the motorway. It’s quiet and relaxing, and actually quite enjoyable to go on a long-distance run with. The little 1.2 engine also has plenty of punch, so it actually does surprisingly well when it comes to overtaking. The only complaint – and we're being picky – is that there's some wind noise from the mirrors at higher speeds. Get off the motorway and onto roads with corners, and you’ll find the 2008’s trade-off for that comfy suspension. It’s quite soft and floats over the surface so you don't get that reassurance of grip, and there’s a good bit of body lean when you go around bends. If you can push past the lack of confidence, it does grip quite well and feels competent, and the traction control will step in to stop things getting out of hand, but it will skip and hop slightly if you hit a bad bump mid-corner. Really, the 2008 does exactly what you need a car such as this to do. Be relaxing and comfortable for daily duties. But if you really want a tall-ish small SUV that’s properly fun to drive, you should probably be looking at the Ford Puma. Space and practicality Space and practicality Managing to beat many of its key rivals in boot space, the 2008 can be quite tight for those sitting in the back seats The front of the 2008’s cabin is reasonably spacious, and the way the passenger-side dashboard is scalloped in means that there’s a little more knee-room on that side. For storage, there’s a nice lidded storage box in front of the gear lever, which can optionally have a wireless phone charging pad, and another open storage space just below that. There are two cupholders on the centre console — one deep, for bottles, and a shallow one for smaller coffee cups — and there’s a small storage box under the centre arm-rest, which has a tiny, kinda pointless, lift-out tray in it. Why? Nobody knows… The glovebox is also tiny, a common bugbear for UK-market Peugeots, because it has to share space with the fusebox. If you had a left-hand drive model, the glovebox would be twice the size. The door bins are decent, though, and can hold a big bottle of water. The door bins in the back are good too, and are actually almost the same size as those in the front. There are seat-back nets for storage, too. There are ISOFIX points in the outer two back seats for child safety (and GT models can have another set of points in the front passenger seat) but there are some niggles here. First off, the door opening is quite narrow, so it can be a faff to squeeze a big seat in, while the ISOFIX anchors are covered with little zipped panels. That zip feels pretty flimsy and it’s likely to break if you’re using them a lot. Still, there’s enough space to load in a bulky rear-facing seat, which is good. Rear seat space is fine in terms of legroom and headroom for adults, but if you’re trying to fit three people across the back, the way the roof-line leans inwards means that those sitting in the outer seats will find their heads brushes the sides of the roof. The rear windows are quite shallow too, which means that kids won’t be able to see out quite so well. The 2008’s boot is decent, with 434 litres of available space on offer. You can fit a big suitcase, little suitcase, and a squashy bag; or you could easily fit in a big, folded-up baby buggy. That's better than the Skoda Kamiq's and Seat Arona's 400 litres but falls short of the Volkswagen T-Cross, which has 455 litres, and the Ford Puma, which has 456 litres. It's much more space than the Vauxhall Mokka (355 litres), while the funky Citroen C3 Aircross also doesn't quite match up at 410 litres. There’s no load lip, so heavy items can be slid in and out easily, and the boot floor is adjustable to height if you really need to pack things in — plus, there’s even a nice, tactile metal handle for moving the boot floor. A nice touch. However, don’t bother looking for tie-down points, luggage hooks, or 12-volt sockets because they’re not there. The rear seats split-fold in a 60:40 ratio, and they do lie mostly flat (although there is a slight incline). The 2008 has the Ford Puma beaten for seats-down space — 1,467 litres. Annoyingly, though, the rear seatbelts get caught and trapped very easily when you fold and unfold the rear seat. That wouldn’t happen in a Skoda Kamiq… However, what is very good is that the luggage cover fits under the adjustable boot floor when you’re not using it, which is so much better than leaving it at home. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories For those wanting a funky cabin, the 2008 delivers in spades. It's just a shame the updated infotainment system still isn't the easiest to use If anything, the 2008’s interior is even more interesting than its striking exterior. You get a multi-layered dashboard, which is mostly made from very nice, soft-touch materials (although things do get a bit cheaper and scratchier as you go further down). Below the main touchscreen, there’s a nice panel that has shortcut controls for the screen, as well as ‘hot keys’ for things like defrosting the windscreen and switching on the hazard lights. These can be a pain to use as they're touch-sensitive rather than physical dials and buttons, so you have to look away from the road to use them. Some parts seem a bit cheaply built, but overall the 2008’s cabin looks and feels pretty expensive. That new 10.0-inch infotainment screen, introduced as part of the 2023 updates, helps to elevate the interior. It looks great and gets some smart, snazzy graphics that respond quickly to your inputs. The only downside is that it's still not the most intuitive system to navigate around – though Apple CarPlay and Android Auto come as standard, which is good news. You get two USB sockets (one regular, one USB-C) in the front on all but the most basic models, and two more in the back. The digital instruments — again standard on everything but the base model, which gets analogue dials — are really nice, looking high-tech and allowing you to choose from a swathe of different displays. The mix of high-set instruments with the tiny, low-set steering wheel looks pretty cool, and it can work for some drivers, but many will find that when they’re sitting comfortably, the top of the steering wheel cuts across the instruments. That’s annoying. What’s not annoying is that the doors wrap around under the sills of the car, so when you’re getting in and out, you won’t be putting stripes of road grim up the backs of your trousers. MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax There are two petrol engines to choose from. The entry level engine is a 1.2-litre unit that comes with a six-speed manual gearbox and makes 100hp with official fuel economy of up to 53.2mpg. Step up the range and you get the same engine with a 130hp output. Allure versions have the same manual gearbox, but GT models use an eight-speed automatic. The manual is a bit more economical, seeing up to 52.7mpg in official tests, compared with 48.9 in the auto. The 2008 is a reasonably economical vehicle. We averaged 47mpg, driving the 130hp version of the 1.2-litre petrol engine with the six-speed manual gearbox. You won’t get much better economy from the cheaper 100hp version, because it does struggle with the car’s weight. All have very similar CO2 emissions of between 120 and 140g/km, meaning first-year road tax is on the lower end of the scale. When it comes to company car tax , each is around 30% benefit-in-kind, but the electric E-2008 is your best bet in this regard at just 2%. Safety and security Safety and security The Peugeot 2008 is one of those cars that’s fallen foul of the way in which the independent crash test experts, Euro NCAP , tests cars for safety. Basically, NCAP deducts points and star ratings if a car puts some key safety items on the options list, as Peugeot does. So, without the optional Safety Pack fitted, the 2008 scores only three stars for crash protection, but gets a four-star rating with it fitted. The way the car protects those sitting within it stays basically the same between the two, but the difference is seen in the way the 2008 protects other, vulnerable, road users such as pedestrians and cyclists. Basically, more expensive models get an improved camera-and-radar controlled emergency braking system, which is better at detecting those walking or on bikes, and that’s what NCAP wants to see. Quite rightly too, even if it does drive up the price you pay. All models get front driver and passenger airbags, as well as front side airbags, and full-length curtain airbags. Also standard is cruise control with a speed limiter, lane-keeping assistance for the steering, speed sign recognition. Adaptive cruise control, which maintains your distance to the car in front and can keep you in lane, is an optional extra on top-spec versions. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems Peugeot has done very well in recent reliability surveys, and the 2008 especially so, finishing in the top-15 of a recent major UK survey of owner satisfaction. The 1.2-litre engine is a well-proven unit, and is used across a wide variety of models, so there aren’t too many mysteries about it. Peugeot’s warranty isn’t all that generous, though. You get a basic three-year, 60,000-mile warranty as standard, although that can be extended out to 100,000-miles as a cost option. Peugeot offers an inclusive service plan, which costs £18 per month for petrol or diesel models. The current 2008 has been the subject of recalls, but they have been for minor issues, such as anti-corrosion protection on the front subframe, a blocked AdBlue injector on early diesel models, and a loose rear shock absorber mounting bolt.

https://www.carwow.co.uk/peugeot/308-sw,Peugeot 308 SW Review & Prices,"€43,199",8/10,new,"Is the Peugeot 308 SW a good car? Is the Peugeot 308 SW a good car? If you like the look of the Peugeot 308 but need a bit more space, the 308 SW estate could be the right car for you. With the larger boot space and a higher roof line, it’s considerably more practical than the hatchback and goes up against the likes of the Vauxhall Astra Sports Tourer , Volkswagen Golf Estate and Skoda Octavia Estate . It’s a lot like one of the big blue Ikea bags – it’s large, practical and it stands out from the crowd. The Peugeot’s a bit more fashionable, though. The exterior design incorporates a rather large grille with the new Peugeot shield at the centre and the headlights blended into the edges. The car also has fang-like daytime running lights that add extra detail to the front, while you get sharp lines and cool alloy wheel designs down the side. The SW’s rear lights have a 3D effect to them, while you also get more creases and thick cladding on the bumper. Inside, you’ll find Peugeot’s iCockpit concept. You get two 10.0-inch displays – one for the instruments and the other for the touchscreen infotainment – as well as comfort seats, sport pedals, gloss black trim, a small steering wheel and interesting materials on the dashboard. Room in the rear seats isn’t the best though. Unlike the spacious feeling you get up front, the rear seats are a bit cramped for adults, with head and knee room a little tight. The 308 SW also doesn’t have the widest door openings to fit child seats, and you then have to poke around in the seat base to attach the seat to the Isofix anchor points. Conversely, boot space is pretty good. You get 608 litres in the standard SW, while the plug-in hybrid alternative’s area drops to 548 litres. That’s bigger than its chassis mate, the Vauxhall Astra Sports Tourer , and just pips the Volkswagen Golf Estate . It does lose out to the Skoda Octavia though. You can choose from a petrol, diesel or two plug-in hybrids – all of which are paired to an eight-speed automatic transmission. Both PHEVs can offer 40 miles of electric range, which can be held so you can use it when you need it. In town, the 308 SW feels a little juddery when going over bumps and the engine feels a little out of breath when you initially get going. But you get decent visibility all-round and the steering is quite light to make manoeuvring simple. On a long motorway cruise, the 308 SW comes into its own. The lack of comfort in town is swapped for a smooth ride at higher speeds, while all the engines will get you up to speed easily enough. While the lighter steering works well in town, it feels quite remote when you go on a twisty road. Sure that’s not what the 308 SW is made for, but it feels a little out of its comfort zone. The suspension soaks up the bumps okay, but you can expect some body roll. With a near class-leading boot and stylish looks, the Peugeot 308 SW is a decent estate car in many respects – but its interior space might not suit you. If you want the latest deals on the Peugeot 308 SW or other new Peugeot models , go through carwow, where you can also get used deals on Peugeots . To change your car completely, you can sell your car through carwow, where our dealers will bid on your car to get you the best price. How much is the Peugeot 308 SW? How much is the Peugeot 308 SW? Being a newer model, the Peugeot 308 SW is a bit more expensive than cars like the Skoda Octavia Estate and Volkswagen Golf Estate, but manages to be cheaper than the Ford Focus Estate . Built on the same platform as the Astra Sports Tourer, it’s around the same price as the stylish Vauxhall. With the prices all rather close together, you’ll have to look at the equipment and styling of each to see which suits you best. Performance and Drive Comfort Performance and Drive Comfort For long distance driving, the 308 SW is very comfortable, but it feels a bit bumpy in town As a longer vehicle, you do have to be wary of your placement when turning into narrower streets with the 308 SW. But with sensors fitted, you can get through tighter gaps fairly easily. You get light steering that makes manoeuvring fairly simple, and a tight turning circle allows for easy progress in tight car parks or streets. Thanks to the larger windows either side of you and at the rear, visibility is good, helping you have a good view around you. Even with the smallish wheels you can get with the 308 SW, the ride can feel a bit harsh at slower speeds. But once you get above 20mph or so, the ride isn’t as troublesome. Where the 308 SW feels most at home is cruising. It’s very sure of itself here, taking road imperfections in its stride, so you won’t be troubled by all but the sharpest bumps. Accelerating onto the motorway can make the engine sound rather strained. Even so, you reach higher speeds without much trouble and you can cruise long distances in comfort, as you have decent space around you. Peugeot has done a good job of making the controls easy to use on the steering wheel, so setting the cruise control is a simple task. With comfort in mind more than anything else, the 308 SW isn’t the most dynamic estate around. For us, the light steering and small wheel don’t feel quite as useful here as they do in town, while the lack of feel from the steering means you don’t have as much sense of grip on the road as you might like. As the SW is also quite long, it can feel cumbersome if you go round a corner too quickly, with body roll making you feel a touch unsteady. But if you’re taking it easy, it’s more than capable and you get enough punch from the engines. The hybrid version will have electrical assistance to help you get out of corners, but it won’t make it an exciting sports estate. Space and practicality Space and practicality While the boot and cabin storage are both good, you may feel a little cramped in the rear seats If you’ve seen the cabins Peugeot has been making over the last few years, you’ll have seen that the French brand has gone in a unique direction. The iCockpit setup looks super modern and here in the 308 SW, it does give a decent amount of adjustment. But what you’ll need to consider is that with the small steering wheel being low down so you can see the driver’s display, it then limits legroom, and vice versa if you put the steering wheel higher. You do have to compromise on one or the other, and we recommend you try it to see if the position works for you. Storage around you is okay, with a sliding cover for the cupholders and a pad under the central displays for wireless charging or plugging in devices. There’s also a space under the armrest that’s a lot deeper. The doorbins, however, are quite shallow and the plastic they’re made of feels scratchy. Space up front on the whole though is rather good, with decent amounts of headroom and passenger legroom. While you get a good setup in the front, the rear doesn’t live up to the same billing. Behind a taller driver, many adults won’t have a lot of wiggle room for their legs, while headroom can be tight. For fitting a child seat, the rear opening can feel a little narrow for a bulkier unit, and the ISOFIX points themselves are behind zip covers in the seat base. It can also take a bit of stabbing around to eventually fit the seat. Storage-wise, the rear seats have a fairly modest door bin, a well-sized seat pocket and charging ports for devices in the centre. The square shape of the boot allows you to pack things in easily, while the lip is level with the floor to make loading and unloading simple. The 608-litre space of the unelectrified model is rather good compared to the likes of the Vauxhall Astra Sports Tourer (597 litres) and is on par with the Ford Focus Estate (608 litres). The Volkswagen Golf Estate (611 litres) and Skoda Octavia Estate (640 litres) both outstrip it though. If you go for the plug-in hybrid model instead of the petrol or diesel, you lose 60 litres due to the electrical system. That’s still better than the hybrid Astra and surprisingly better than the Skoda Octavia PHEV, which loses close to a quarter of the standard car’s boot space. By folding the rear seats down, you get a continuous floor that’s almost flat, with the seat backs at a slight angle. You get 1,634 litres when you fold them down in the petrol or diesel car, with the PHEV getting 1,574 litres. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories With the modern iCockpit layout, the 308 SW has a cool cabin, but the infotainment can be laggy and dark As we mentioned earlier, the iCockpit layout is very modern-looking and unlike most other interior displays on the market. With the small steering wheel, sharp lines and clear displays, the 308 SW’s interior is one of the nicest-looking you can find. Most trims feature a grey and black finish that have different textures and can make the cabin feel a little dingy. The GT version comes with three interior trim finishes, with all getting a very vibrant green detailing throughout – although it is the most expensive version available if you want it. A lot of the materials are of a better quality than you’d expect for the price, and the touch and feel of the surfaces are nice too. You will find scratchier plastics lower down though, while the piano black plastics and screens show up smudges very quickly. Talking of the screens, you get one behind the steering wheel for driver’s information, while you get two touchscreens in the middle – one that acts as the main infotainment and the second is a customisable panel with shortcuts to the menus you use most, which is a clever idea. While we like the size and definition of the screen itself, you’ll find that the system isn’t the quickest and is a bit dark – even with the customisable colour options on offer. By connecting to it with your smartphone through Android Auto or Apple CarPlay , you’ll find it much easier to use. There aren’t a plethora of options to choose from, but you can get a tow bar, additional drive assists and a 360-degree camera if you feel the need to include them. MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax You get the choice of a petrol, a diesel and two plug-in hybrids. All of them are paired to an eight-speed automatic and have front-wheel drive. For the lone petrol, the 1.2-litre turbocharged unit produces 127hp and 230Nm. From that, you can achieve up to 51.9mpg and emit between 123-147 g/km of CO2. The 1.5-litre diesel also gets 127hp, but offers more torque at 300Nm. Efficiency-wise, you can get up to 59.6mpg from the diesel, while it emits 124-148 g/km CO2. On to the plug-in hybrids, both of which are made up of a 1.6-litre petrol and an electric motor, mounted on the front axle. You can go for the lesser-powered version with 177hp and 360Nm, or the top-end version that has 222hp and the same amount of torque. With the 12.4kWh battery pack on-board, the 180hp version gets 43 miles of EV range, while the 222hp option gets 42 miles. As standard you get 3.7kW charging, but you can choose a 7.4kW option for shorter charging stops. As with other plug-in hybrids, Peugeot has quoted efficiency figures well into the 200s for both, but the likelihood of you ever reaching those heights is pretty slim. You’ll need to find a consistent place to charge them up to get anywhere near those high mpg figures. All but the top-spec GT with the highest-powered hybrid cost more than £40,000, so unless you pick that you won’t be paying an additional charge in VED from the second year onwards. For the lowest tax, you should choose the slightly pricier hybrids, but the petrol and diesel engines fall into the same brackets. Safety and security Safety and security Unlike a lot of new cars, the Peugeot 308 SW has a four-star rating from the Euro NCAP safety tests. That was without the safety pack though, so could be improved if that was fitted – costing an extra £200. It had average scores on pedestrian and safety assist safety, with better scores on both occupant categories. Although there are some quality safety features with the 308 SW, they’re mostly offered with the higher spec models. Features like adaptive cruise control, rear cross traffic alert and blind spot monitoring are fitted to the top two trim levels, but active safety brake, lane keep assist and regular cruise control are standard. Safety features also include two ISOFIX points on the rear, all-round airbags and an immobiliser. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems At the moment, the latest Peugeot 308 SW has yet to have any major issues. Peugeot does have a reputation of building unreliable models in the past, but its newer models have bucked that trend. If you buy the vehicle through a Peugeot dealer, you get two years of manufacturer warranty with unlimited mileage, while you can get an additional year courtesy of the retailer network. An extended warranty is available from Peugeot if the car is less than 10 years old and has less than 100,000 miles on the clock for peace of mind."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/peugeot/e-308-sw,Peugeot e-308 SW Review & Prices,"€47,016",7/10,new,"Is the Peugeot e-308 SW a good car? Is the Peugeot e-308 SW a good car? The Peugeot e-308 SW is one of those rare things - a fully electric estate car. Together with the mechanically identical Vauxhall Astra Sports Tourer Electric , it joins the bargain-basement MG5 EV and the Porsche Taycan Sport Turismo as the only such models on sale in the UK. Most car companies have so far preferred to sink their investment into electric SUVs , but an electric estate car has many benefits - it’s still very practical for a family, but being lower to the ground and lighter is more efficient than a tall, heavy SUV, and can therefore eke out that extra bit of range from the battery pack. A bit like Betamax, it’s a good idea that has a bit of an uphill struggle to compete with the flavour of the month - though unlike Betamax, it doesn’t look like the e-308 SW will be a total failure. In fact, it’s quite a likeable car, especially when you get inside. Like all current Peugeots, the e-308 SW has an interior that feels stylish, upmarket and packed with technology. A 10.0-inch touchscreen and digital instrument panel make it feel suitably up-to-date, but it’s the little features that make it feel premium - the posh-feeling toggle switches under the central screen, for example, or the big swathe of fabric running across the dashboard and the tops of the doors. Some drivers might not get on with Peugeot’s i-Cockpit setup, which places the instrument cluster high up above a shrunken steering wheel - which you look over, rather than through. You might find you need to lower the wheel more than you’re comfortable with to see the dials properly, so it could be worth taking a test drive to make sure you can get on with it. Range: 248 miles Efficiency: 4.1 miles per kWh Battery size: 51kWh Max charge speed: 100kW Charge time AC: 7hrs 30 mins, 0-100%, 7kW Charge time DC: 30 mins, 0-80%, 100kW Charge port location: Left rear Power output: 156hp Regardless of size you should have no trouble getting on with the e-308 SW’s practicality. Its 548-litre boot is huge, being long and wide with a completely flat floor when you fold the seats down. It’s ideal for big shops, trips to the flat-pack furniture store or the occasional tip run, and should be able to accommodate even a big pushchair with ease. Rear legroom isn’t quite as generous, but it’s sufficient for a six-foot adult - and the equal of any of the compact electric SUVs you might be considering as an alternative, like a Kia Niro EV or Volkswagen ID3 . Peugeot is keen that its electric cars should feel no different to its petrol or diesel ones, so the e-308 SW is made to be as similar to the regular 308 as possible. To that end, you don’t get a particularly whizzy electric motor or bags and bags of power like some alternatives. A fairly modest power output here means excellent efficiency, allowing the e-308’s comparatively small battery to still provide a competitive range of up to 248 miles. That does mean, though, that if you want zippy performance - or a longer range - you’ll need to look elsewhere, as Peugeot only offers the one powertrain. It might also sting that the e-308 SW’s comparatively modest performance comes at an asking price several thousand pounds more than faster and longer-range contemporaries.

Check out used Peugeot 308s , or other used Peugeots - and remember that when the time comes, you can even sell your car online on Carwow. How much is the Peugeot e-308 SW? How much is the Peugeot e-308 SW? The entry-level e-308 SW is the Allure, which comes in at a little over £41,000. Despite an extensive equipment list, that seems like a hard sell considering a Tesla Model 3 is under £40,000, a VW ID3 starts from less than £36,000 and the MG5 - a competitive electric estate - costs less than £31,000. All three of these cars are quicker and have a longer driving range than the e-308 SW, too - though the Peugeot has by far the nicest interior. For a couple of extra thousand, the e-308 SW GT gets a more stylish look and some extra interior equipment, but it’s not worth the upstep in our view. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort Comfortable to drive, but considerably outgunned by cheaper opposition In town In town you can see why so many people like the high-up driving position of a compact SUV - the e-308 SW feels a little low and vulnerable when mingling in traffic with Range Rovers , though you fairly quickly get over that. All-round visibility is a mixed bag, with a great view out the front but a narrow rear window and small rear-view mirrors. At least all models do get a high-res reversing camera as standard. The e-308 is nippy up to 30mph, and Normal mode is fast enough that you won’t feel the need to switch to Sport during regular town driving. It’s comfortable, too, riding over potholes and speed bumps with good grace despite relatively large alloy wheels. It’s a shame, though, that Peugeot doesn’t fit a one-pedal driving mode like you get in an MG4 or a Nissan Leaf. Regenerative braking is limited unless you switch the gear selector into ‘B’ mode, but even then it’s pretty modest - and annoyingly, you don’t get any regen until the battery has run down past about 95%, so the first few miles after a charge feel strangely inconsistent. On the motorway The e-308 SW’s performance is modest - 0-62mph takes almost ten seconds, which for a modern EV seems like an age even though by normal standards it’s plenty quick enough. What this means is that, if the e-308 SW is your first EV, it’ll probably feel quite fast - but if you’re coming to it from another electric car there’s every chance it’ll feel pretty sluggish. You do feel a slight lack of power when it comes to a short slip-road, for example, or when trying to execute a swift overtake. It’s at these moments you might want to switch into the ‘Sport’ driving mode to get the maximum performance available. On a twisty road Again, the e-308 SW’s lack of grunt means you won’t be zipping from bend to bend like you would in some electric cars, but it corners surprisingly well and is rather satisfying to drive on a twisting B-road. It doesn’t lean too much in the bends, and the small steering wheel makes executing quick changes of direction easy - even if there’s not that much communication about what the front wheels are doing. It rides bumps well here too, and isn’t upset by mid-corner bumps in the way that some heavy electric SUVs are. Space and practicality Space and practicality A huge, practical boot, but only average space in the rear seats The e-308 SW’s stylish cabin conceals a good amount of space for odds and ends. There are two large cupholders, a shelf for a smartphone (with a wireless charging pad on some variants) and a useful spot for keys or other pocket contents. There’s also space under the central armrest, plus USB-C and USB-A charging points to compliment the 12V socket. This makes up for a rather piddly half-sized glovebox. The door bins are a good size, though, and are fabric-lined so the contents don’t rattle. The front seats are comfortable and adjust for drivers of all sizes, but one point for taller people to note is that they sit quite far back - if you have the seat at its farthest reach, you might find your shoulder is actually behind the door pillar, which can make it a bit more awkward to get into and out of. Space in the back seats The rear seats are comfortable enough for adults, and provided the front seat passengers aren’t over six feet tall there’s enough room back there for a pair of similar-sized occupants. A third passenger doesn’t have quite as much luck - the central seat is narrow, and unlike most electric cars the e-308 doesn’t have a flat floor in the back so there’s a central hump to straddle your feet across. Rear passengers do get a pair of USB-C ports for device charging, which is useful, as well as pockets on the seat backs and pretty large door bins. Isofix points are present in both outer rear seats, with their fittings hidden behind zips - a bit fiddly, but quite tidy. Boot space The e-308 SW’s boot is slightly smaller than that on the regular 308 SW, with 548 litres of space versus the 608 litres you get in petrol and diesel models. It’s the same size as the plug-in hybrid 308 SW, though. It’s also a really useful size - much larger than the 479 litres you get in an MG5 EV, and easily beating out the Volkswagen ID3’s 385 litres. Unlike the MG5, there’s no load lip to hoick items over, and the space is totally flat and unobstructed when the seats are down. There’s a small area under the floor where you can store your charging cable, but no ‘frunk’ like you get in a Tesla Model 3. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories Upmarket feel and great material quality, but a lack of physical switchgear irritates Peugeot’s positioning itself as a bit of a Marks and Spencers of late - not quite fully premium, but definitely posher than the average Tesco. This is most obvious on the inside, where the e-308 SW’s interior - shared with the rest of the 308 range - is nicely designed, uses high-quality materials and feels built to last. It’s stylish, too. The dashboard has interesting swoops and lines running across it, which form the centre console and the storage areas. There are also different textures used, like a squidgy plastic that looks like woven carbon fibre (it’s not) and fabric panels. Compared with the snooze-fest that is the MG5 EV’s interior, or even the smart-but-dull Vauxhall Astra Sports Tourer, the e-308 SW feels really upmarket. Most of the car’s functions are controlled through a 10.0-inch infotainment touchscreen . It’s a very wide screen and makes the most of this with an interface that’s often divided into two separate panels, but it’s still not the easiest system to navigate around. Neither is the driver information display, which looks really cool with its 3D effect but can be a pain if you want a specific piece of information to be showing. You do get a secondary touchscreen which holds customisable shortcuts - Peugeot calls them ‘i-Toggles’. It’s a useful way to put functions that you use regularly front and centre. Smartphone connectivity via Apple CarPlay and Android Auto is standard, and these make the most of the touchscreen’s width - though it’s annoying that you need to come out of them to make any adjustments to the climate controls. Electric range, charging and tax Electric range, charging and tax The e-308 SW uses a modestly-sized 51kWh battery, which is smaller than most alternatives. However, an official range figure of 248 miles is pretty competitive - which shows that Peugeot’s doing a good job of eking out every bit of juice in an efficient manner. During our time with the car, we managed around 4 miles per kWh over mixed mileage, which means a real-world range of around 200 miles - dropping to around 170 during pure motorway driving. That’s a better efficiency figure than we managed from a Volkswagen ID3 or MG5 EV, though the Tesla Model 3 is even more miserly - and has a bigger battery in the first place. Peugeot doesn’t fit a very powerful charger either, which means the e-308 SW can only top up at a maximum rate of 100kW. That’s faster than the MG5, but not as quick as a VW ID3 or an MG4. Running costs will be low, thanks to that efficiency - even by electric car standards, though this is unlikely to make up for the car’s high purchase price unless you’re an extremely high-mileage driver. Compared to petrol or even plug-in hybrid cars, though, company car buyers will see their running costs drop significantly, and like all EVs the e-308 SW is exempt from road tax until 2025. Safety and security Safety and security The e-308 SW gets its Euro NCAP crash test safety score from the regular 308 hatchback, which means it inherits a four-star rating. That’s not up there with the five stars awarded to the Volkswagen ID3 or the MG4, mainly due to the score for the protection of vulnerable road users. Adult and child occupant scores were higher, but not the best. Standard safety equipment is good, though, including autonomous emergency braking, lane-keeping assist and cruise control. Peugeot’s systems aren’t as obtrusive as some alternatives, but you do need to fiddle about in the touchscreen to turn most of them off which can be a pain to do on the move. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems Peugeot offers the e-308 SW with a pretty standard warranty of three years and 60,000 miles. There’s also an eight-year/100,000 mile battery warranty, based on it retaining at least 70% of its original capacity. Compared with the seven years of warranty cover you get on an MG5 or a Kia Niro EV, that’s a bit rubbish, but it’s in line with what Volkswagen offers on the ID3. Peugeot’s reliability has been a mixed bag over the years, but it’s improving. The brand ranked 9th in the 2023 Driver Power owner satisfaction survey , suggesting an upward trend - and the e-308 SW has very few mechanical components to go wrong, in common with most EVs."

The Peugeot 108 is undeniably one of the old ’uns in the city car segment, alongside its fellow old-stagers the Citroen C1 and Toyota Aygo , which are basically the same car underneath. So does the three-of-a-kind 108 represent a safe bet, or is it a gamble too far these days? Well, so far, only the Hyundai i10 – with its spacious interior and generous equipment levels – has had the measure of the Volkswagen Up / Seat Mii / Skoda Citigo (now dead) trio. Still, from the off, the Peugeot has all the important boxes ticked: it’s cheap to buy, frugal to run, has small dimensions and cheeky looks. It also has equipment such as a touchscreen infotainment system, air-conditioning, plus automatic headlights and wipers. The old Peugeot 108 was always an excellent city car. Its willing little three-cylinder engine, in town at least, gave nippy performance and emitted a pleasant thrum that meant working it hard wasn’t a chore on the ears. The same wasn’t true at motorway speeds, where the engine noise soon manifested itself as a constant and annoying drone. Peugeot has looked to address this in the new model and it’s something VW managed with the Up. Last but not least is the option to fit a fold-back fabric roof that is electrically operated and gives something of a convertible feel. It was an option fitted to the 108 Top Allure. The new Peugeot 108 is a vast improvement over the car it replaces thanks to boosted safety and even lower running costs. It is also better equipped and enjoyable to own, especially if you choose to spec the full-length folding fabric roof that effectively transforms the car into a cut-price convertible. All good news then, but elephants in the room come in the form of the Hyundai i10 and the Volkswagen Up – the duo are more fun to drive, have added solidity and are more practical – three advantages that are hard to ignore in this class.

How much does the Peugeot 108 cost? How much does the Peugeot 108 cost? Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort Small dimensions make the 108 perfect for cutting through congested city streets, it has a tight turning circle and light controls that make low-speed manoeuvring simple, but rapid it is not There’s just the solitary engine on offer, a 72hp 1.0-litre three-cylinder affair. It’s certainly no ball of fire, getting to 62mph in around 14 seconds and topping out at 99mph. However, searing pace is not what you buy such cars for. Cheap running costs are these engines’ forte and neither disappoints in this respect – the 1.0-litre model can return 58.9mpg and CO2 emissions of 110g/km. The fuel tank is only 35 litres but the economy means you shouldn’t have to fill it too often. Nonetheless, a high biting point for the clutch can make for jerky progress at low speeds – not helped by the throbbing three-cylinder engine that often feels like it is about to stall. The rest of the time, though, the 108 is a joy to use on inner streets as it squeezes through tight spaces and nips into gaps in traffic. The Allure model carwow tested also came with a reversing camera which made it super easy to shoehorn into tight parking spaces. The suspension also does a decent job of smoothing out bumps, although it can get bouncy over a succession of undulations. Town driving is undeniably the 108’s forte, but it has always felt much less at ease on the motorway, where it can be a little too noisy. It’s better in this respect than ever, but it still can’t live with the Hyundai i10 or VW Up for interior refinement. Space and practicality Space and practicality The Peugeot 108 is one of the smallest cars on sale, but at least the front seats are spacious. There’s not much room for adults in the back seats and the boot is small, however While the comparatively spacious VW Up is an all new model, the 108 is a thorough reworking of the old car and that shows when it comes to passenger space. Room in the front is fine, but adults will feel squeezed in the back and six-footers can forget about getting comfortable if there’s someone similarly tall up front. Headroom, in particular, is in short supply and the small doors mean accessing the rear isn’t particularly easy, either. Rear windows that clip out (rather than winding down) cement the claustrophobic feel. Interior storage isn’t as good as you get in a Volkswagen Up or SEAT Mii , because their door bins and glovebox are both bigger than you get in the Peugeot. But, on the bright side, if you go for the 108 TOP, its fold-back fabric roof means long items fit without any problem at all. With a capacity of 196 litres, the new 108 has a fair-sized luggage area, but it’s still quite a bit smaller than the 251-litre boot in the Volkswagen Up or the Hyundai i10’s 252-litre load bay. Unfortunately, there’s quite a drop from the boot lip to the boot floor, which will make getting bags into and out of the load area more of a strain that would be ideal. The rear seats fold down easily enough but leave a large step in the floor, hampering usability. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories Sit in the 108 and it feels pretty cheap but you get what you pay for. It’s actually pretty well put together, with a grown-up feel, but can’t match a VW Up for quality Keeping things looking suitably youthful are optional bright coloured plastic surrounds for the air vents and the seven-inch infotainment system (fitted to Active models and above). It has to be said, though, plastic quality falls behind that of the Up and the Hyundai i10. Peel back the fabric roof, which can be specified in all but entry-level Access trim, and the interior is filled with light. It’s a nifty feature on a car of this price, but it does have its drawbacks and with the roof down the infotainment screen can be hard to read in direct sunlight, while an annoying whistle can be heard at speed. All models get a 7-inch colour touchscreen with the Mirror Screen system, which allows you to use Android Auto or Apple CarPlay through the screen. This allows you to operate apps such as Waze or Google Maps for sat-nav and Spotify or Apple Music for music streaming. Both DAB radio and Bluetooth are also fitted as standard, helping your entertainment and your connectivity."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/peugeot/e-408,Peugeot E-408 Review & Prices,"€50,977",Not found,new,"Is the Peugeot E-408 a good car? Is the Peugeot E-408 a good car? The Peugeot E-408 is the new electric version of the 408, a swoopy saloon/coupé/pseudo-SUV. It’s a bit like a Picasso painting; there’s a lot going on wherever you look, but it all comes together to make something rather striking. It’s yet another entrant into the coupé- SUV market, making it an alternative to the Renault Rafale , Citroen C5 X , Cupra Formentor and the Ford Mustang Mach-E . It may not be a ‘classically’ handsome design, but it’s hard to deny that the E-408 is a stylish car; even if it’s in an unconventional way. Peugeot is definitely showing some of its old ways with its current range, and the E-408 brings with it some additional French flair. Aggressive, pointy headlights and a ‘gradient’ grille give the E-408 a sporty nose, whilst at the back you’ll find a little flick-up spoiler above a pseudo-light bar and a rather large diffuser-style bumper trim. The fastback-style sloping roof and angular shoulder line give the jacked-up coupe a purposeful stance. Range: 281 Miles Efficiency: 3.5-4.5 miles per kWh Battery size: 58kWh Max charge speed: 100kW Charge time AC: 5hrs20mins, 0-100%, 11kWh Charge time DC: 35mins, 20-80%, 100kWh Charge port location: Left Side Rear Power outputs: 210hp The angular design theme continues inside the E-408, with a dashboard design that’s much less curvy than any alternatives. That’s not a critique though, in fact the multimedia display and control buttons facing the driver give the cockpit a real fighter-jet vibe; as does the small squared-off steering wheel perched below the driver display. Be warned though, some drivers might find that the steering wheel gets in the way of the driver’s screen if you set it too high so bear that in mind when getting comfy in the driver’s seat. Just like its petrol and hybrid stablemates, the E-408’s cabin will be full of posh, soft-touch materials and good standard kit. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto should be all you need these days, but if you’re a fan of manufacturer systems then Peugeot’s own ‘i-Connect’ infotainment system is a great one to use. The rakish roofline would suggest that rear seat and boot space is compromised but you’d be surprised. Boot space is less than a petrol-powered 408 but the same as the 408 hybrid, whilst rear seat space is likely to be the same too. Expect adequate head room for adults in the back, even if it is a little cosy for shoulder space. When it comes to performance, the E-408 is no slouch but don’t go expecting lap records either. A 210hp motor and 58kWh battery promises up to 281 miles of range which is similar to what alternatives can manage. The E-408 can go from 20-80% charge in 30 minutes on a 100kW rapid charger, which is okay, if not fantastic We’ll have a full review for you as soon as we get our hands on this swoopy-looking electric car, but in the meantime you can get ahead on Carwow’s Peugeot E-408 deals . You can also check out the rest of the new Peugeot deals or consider other used Peugeot models . Carwow can even help when you decide to sell your car , too. How much is the Peugeot E-408? How much is the Peugeot E-408? The Peugeot E-408 starts at just over £42,000 in ‘Allure’ trim, climbing to around £45,000 for the higher-spec ‘GT’ model - the only two specs available at the moment. That’s about the same as the new Ford Capri, though it’s a couple of thousand pounds more than the Renault Rafale hybrid and slightly less than the VW ID.5. ‘Allure’ comes with 19-inch wheels, a wide-angle reverse camera, LED headlights and mixed fabric/faux-leather seats as standard. Stepping up to GT adds a little more standard features, such as aluminium pedals and interior trims, a heated steering wheel, Matrix LED headlights and a body coloured front grille."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/peugeot/e-2008,Peugeot E-2008 Review & Prices,"€41,898",7/10,new,"Is the Peugeot E-2008 a good car? Is the Peugeot E-2008 a good car? If you want a small electric SUV that’s stylish inside and out without sacrificing comfort and practicality, the Peugeot E-2008 is worthy of a spot on your shortlist. The latest model can go a bit further between charges than before too. There are plenty of alternatives at the more affordable end of the electric SUV market, including the MG ZS EV , Volvo EX30 and Vauxhall Mokka Electric , for example. There’s also the Citroen e-C4 and Kia Niro EV , both of which have smart designs – but the E-2008’s chic, upmarket appeal has them all licked. It’s a bit like wearing a Hermès outfit on the catwalk, rather than something from a high street chain. Its fancy styling has some cool details, such as the claw-like running lights in the lower bumper that give it a unique face, while the front grille has upmarket body-coloured inserts on all but the lowest trim. At the back there are LED lights and the Peugeot name is scrawled across the bootlid. Hop inside and you’ll find the style taps are left to flow. A wraparound dashboard is a nice addition, plus there are plenty of high-quality materials used throughout. You’ll have to search hard for anything that feels properly cheap, and there's a big infotainment display that's a bit easier to use than the one in older models, but still not up there with the best. The digital driver’s display is bigger and better than before, too. However, Peugeot’s commitment to having the dials sit above the small wheel means that you’ll find the view of them blocked in some seating positions. Sounds like a minor point, but it’s worth giving it a go before committing to buying an E-2008. Unlike some electric cars which are built from the ground up as battery-powered cars, the E-2008 is based on the petrol-powered 2008. That, unfortunately, results in a hefty hump in the rear seats where you would find mechanical bits in that model, which middle-seat passengers will have to straddle. Those sat in the outer seats will also find kneeroom isn’t great, while taller drivers might find their hair brushes against the bit where the roof meets the door. On the plus side, the boot has no load lip so it’s dead easy to get stuff in and out of, plus its square shape makes it easy to play cargo-loading Tetris. With 435 litres of space to use, it’s fairly good but not massive. The e-C4 and Mokka Electric have less, but the Niro EV can carry more stuff. Spend a bit more and you can have a Skoda Enyaq , which has a massive boot. An update in 2023 increased the E-2008's range from 217 miles to 250 miles, improving the old car's key weakness. That's a useful distance between charges, however, for the cash you can go further in the Kia and a similarly priced MG , while the Citroen and Vauxhall are getting the same battery upgrades as the Peugeot to offer similar range. As well as this single battery option, there’s just one motor option for the E-2008. It’s now 156hp, which is a bit more than before. However, despite having more power it’s very much designed to offer leisurely performance, even if you pop the car into its sportiest settings. Sportiness is not the E-2008’s raison d'etre, though. It can be quite fun to steer down a winding road, but it’s much happier cruising along the motorway or in town, where it soaks up bumps with little fuss. This is a very relaxing and comfortable electric SUV to drive. The Peugeot E-2008 is a real head-turner, and backs this up with a lovely interior, too. Rear seat space is limited and boot capacity is so-so, though the square space does make it more useful. The improved electric range is welcome, too, if still not quite up with the best you can get for this money. Interested?

What with the Peugeot E-2008 feeling like a premium car inside, it’s perhaps no surprise to learn that it’s not the cheapest option in the small electric SUV market. That crown goes to the MG ZS EV; it’s practical and boasts an impressive range in top-spec models, but it does feel rather cheap inside. The Peugeot is good value next to the Vauxhall Mokka Electric, which is less practical with a lower range (until the bigger battery arrives) for a similar price. The Skoda Enyaq and its cavernous boot also fall into this price range, and while it doesn’t feel anywhere near as posh, that extra practicality will certainly appeal if you need the space. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort The Peugeot E-2008 is very comfortable in town and on the motorway, but it’s not the most fun car in corners It’s town driving where you’ll find the Peugeot E-2008 to be the most at home. Light steering makes easy work of manoeuvring tight streets and parking. Visibility out of the back isn’t amazing as a result of the partially sloped roofline, but it’s decent out of the front. A reversing camera comes on top-spec GT models, with top-down and 180-degree views, which all help make squeezing into those tighter spots that much easier. You can add this as an option to Allure models, too. Comfort is an impressive trait in the E-2008. Electric SUVs can be quite uncomfortable because the high body and heavy batteries require unforgiving suspension systems, but the Peugeot glides over bumps and potholes while barely alerting you to their presence. This comfort continues on the motorway, where the E-2008 is a relaxing car to drive. Road noise is pretty low, and though there is a touch of wind noise, it’s not unbearable. Cruise control comes as standard but you’ll need to stump up for an optional assistance pack to get an adaptive system. As well as maintaining a set speed like normal cruise control, adaptive will automatically maintain the distance to the car ahead and adjust and lower its speed accordingly. Super handy if you’re covering long distances. And this option pack also includes a clever system that will keep you in lane if you start to drift across the white lines. If you’re looking for backroad fun, the Peugeot E-2008 isn’t going to deliver big. Though you’ll never feel like it's about to fall over, soft-set suspension means that the car leans a lot when you’re cornering hard, which doesn’t give you too much confidence. And while many electric cars offer thrills through punchy acceleration, the E-2008 gathers speed with all the urgency of a grumpy teenager. It’s not slow, and feels quick enough once you’re on the move, but even in its sporty setting you’re often left underwhelmed when trying to scoot away from a standstill. Space and practicality Space and practicality No load lip and a square shape make the boot more useful than its capacity suggests, but the rear seats are quite cramped The Peugeot E-2008’s diminutive stature means it’s not the most spacious car inside. That said, the lovely interior design isn’t just easy on the eyes, it also tricks you into thinking the car is actually quite big and spacious. However, the devil’s in the details. Taller drivers in particular will find leg space is pretty cramped, especially if you have to push the steering wheel low to see the digital dials. It means knees and hands occasionally compete for space during tight manoeuvres. Similarly, the door bins are quite small and the door handle makes access trickier than it might otherwise be. The cup holders are fairly deep but quite narrow and the glovebox is small too. Positives are a useful shelf beneath the dashboard where you can put your phone, and a hidden cubby hole just above it to store valuables. It’s not much better in the back seats, either. It’s not like you need to pull off a Houdini-esque escape every time you leave the car, but kneeroom is quite limited and, if you’re in the outer two seats, your head will brush the section where the door meets the roof. Want to fit three across the back? It’s actually not too bad for shoulder room, but those on the outside will be forced closer to the door where their heads will become even better acquainted with the headlining. There are ISOFIX points in the outer two seats for a child seat. The door opening is quite narrow, which can make it tricky to fit, but once it’s in there’s plenty of space to the seat in front. The Peugeot E-2008’s boot is a fairly good size, and its square shape means that it’s easy to make the most of the area on offer, so you’ll have ample room for the weekly shop or some suitcase for a weekend away. You will also find some under-floor storage, which is useful for putting your cables and any other rarely used items, or you can remove the false floor for a little extra space. With this in place, there’s no load lip, so you can just slide heavy items out. In terms of capacity, though, the E-2008 is pretty average when compared with the competition. With 435 litres on offer, it has nothing on the Skoda Enyaq’s 585 litres. It’s closer to the Kia Niro EV and MG ZS EV, which have 475 litres and 480 litres respectively. The Citroen e-C4 (380 litres) and Vauxhall Mokka Electric (310 litres) fall well behind the competition. Fold the rear seats flat and you have 1,467 litres of space, which actually makes it one of the more spacious cars among its alternatives, being considerably more than the Citroen and MG, and a fraction more than the Kia. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories The interior’s stylish design is a highlight but the infotainment isn’t particularly intuitive to use While space and practicality might be a mixed bag for the Peugeot E-2008, there can be no denying that the interior is top notch. Peugeot has its sights set on popular premium brands like Audi and BMW , and it’s not as far away as you might think. The centre console’s piano black trim looks a bit cheap and some of the chunky buttons lack the modern elegance you expect from pricier models, but otherwise there are squishy plastics in all the right places and everything feels well put together. That combines with the cool two-tiered design that feels much more special than most other cars at this price point. The 10.0-inch touchscreen sat atop the dashboard also helps, sporting the latest Peugeot infotainment software. The graphics are sharper and clearer, and make the old system look ancient by comparison. It’s also quick to respond to your inputs, but it’s still far from the most intuitive system out there. Another unintuitive feature is the shelf of touch-sensitive shortcut buttons. The idea is to make it easier to navigate to menus such as the climate controls and media, but they don’t fall to hand easily and require you to take your eyes off the road to use them. Electric range, charging and tax Electric range, charging and tax The Peugeot E-2008 has a 54kWh battery pack, which is slightly bigger than what you will find in previous models. The result is that the official range has increased from 217 miles to 250 miles. That’s a useful bump, and now means that we’d consider this range to be more acceptable than it is in older models. For context, that’s about the same as an entry level Skoda Enyaq or top-spec MG ZS EV, both of which are similarly priced to the Peugeot. If range is key, the Kia Niro EV will go 285 miles on a charge, and you can go for a bigger battery in the Skoda to travel comfortably over 300 miles. If you’re looking at the top end of the E-2008’s price range you’re getting closer to a Tesla Model Y , which for a few thousand pounds more will go much further on a charge (and has a bigger boot, too). As an electric car, you won't have to pay any Vehicle Excise Duty on the E-2008, while company car buyers will benefit from the ultra-low Benefit-in-Kind rate. Safety and security Safety and security When safety board Euro NCAP tested the Peugeot 2008 model range, it awarded the car four out of a possible five stars. That also applies to this electric variant. You get a basic level of standard safety kit, such as automatic braking that can detect pedestrians walking into your path, while this is upgraded in Allure models to have a night function and adds the ability to spot cyclists. Front passenger ISOFIX points are included for top-spec models. Adaptive cruise control, which will alter the speed of the car to match those you’re following on the motorway, is an optional extra. You also get Lane Positioning Assist with this, which gives some automatic control over the steering to keep you in the centre of a lane. You’ll still need to keep your hands on the wheel, though. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems The Peugeot E-2008 has been on sale for a few years now, and there have been few signs of any reliability concerns. The combustion-engined versions score well in ownership surveys, and the simplicity of the electric powertrain means the E-2008 should give you fewer things to worry about. From new, the E-2008 is covered by a three-year/60,000-mile warranty which starts from its date of registration. The car’s battery will also be covered by a separate eight-year/100,000-mile warranty should any issues arise in that time. An extended warranty is also available to purchase if your car is less than 10 years old, has covered less than 100,000 miles and is currently covered by a Peugeot warranty."

Like a foreign exchange student in a high school movie, nobody knew what to expect when the Atto 3 came over to the UK. And just like the main character in those films, it fit in better than anyone expected, and BYD has just been getting more and more popular ever since. But where it’s found its place with the Seal , Dolphin and Sealion 7 , you can tell that Atto 3 is part of its learning curve; not quite as stylish as the Peugeot E-2008 or as sleek as the Volvo EX30 . BYD has played it safe with the Atto 3’s styling, and while it’s by no means an ugly car, it has a fairly generic design that might have you daydreaming about its alternatives, as opposed to screaming ‘Build Your Dreams.’ It seems as though BYD’s designers saved all of their interest and intrigue for the Atto 3’s interior because wow, what a wild cabin it has. From the embossed strakes across the dashboard surface to the ‘guitar strings’ on the door pockets, it might be the most fascinating interior in the small SUV market. Range: 261 miles Efficiency: 4.0 mi/kWh Battery size: 60kWh Max charge speed: 88kW Charge time AC: 9hrs 42mins, 0-100%, 7kW Charge time DC: 44mins, 10-80%, 150kW Charge port location: Right front Power outputs: 204hp There’s a ‘floating’, rotatable, 15.6-inch infotainment screen in the middle, in front of a dash-top which resembles a stringray’s pectoral wings. The driver gets their own digital instrument display, though the graphics lag behind alternatives’ screens and it looks a bit cheap, compared to the central display. Still, the steering wheel is swanky and the interior quality is impressive almost everywhere you touch, which can’t be said for a lot of cars at this price point. Apple CarPlay / Android Auto come as standard, plus quirks such as the rotary door handles and in-built karaoke mode add even more character. It’s fairly spacious too, with loads of storage space in the front and back and generally comfortable front seats - though they lack lumbar support. There’s good legroom in the back too, and although it could do with a touch more headroom, the Atto 3 makes up for it with a decently-sized 440-litre boot. There’s a single battery option for the Atto 3, and while it has a 260-mile claimed range, we found it would struggle to reach 200 miles to a charge in the real world, in mixed conditions. And the city is where the Atto 3 shines, with good all-round visibility and standard-fit 360-degree parking cameras. It’s comfortable over bumpy roads too, thanks to its soft suspension, though there’s noticeable wind noise on the motorway and the Atto 3 doesn’t feel particularly stable on country lanes. Some of BYD’s Chinese alternatives have brought lacklustre models to the UK as their first attempts to crack our market, but the Atto 3 marked BYD’s position as a brand worth keeping an eye on. It’s not quite the same level of fit and finish as the Kia EV3 or Renault Scenic E-Tech , but the quirky interior and good standard kit are notable. Check out new BYD Atto 3 deals on Carwow, or BYD Atto 3 lease deals to get one on your driveway without paying a hefty lump sum. There are used BYD Atto 3s available through our network of trusted dealers, and other used BYD models available if you want to browse their full range. Carwow can even help you sell your car when it’s time to make the switch. How much is the BYD Atto 3? How much is the BYD Atto 3? While it’s well-equipped and packs some quirky features, the BYD Atto 3 is far from the affordable electric SUV you might expect from a Chinese manufacturer. You’ll be paying a few thousand pounds more for the Atto 3 than the Peugeot E-2008, for example. Even the extended-range Volvo EX30 can be had for the same price as the entry-level Atto 3, and it’s a far posher choice of car. That being said, the Atto 3 does come with a heat pump as standard, as well as Apple CarPlay/Android Auto connectivity and a plethora of safety assistance tech which helped it earn a five-star Euro NCAP safety rating . Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort The Atto 3 is comfy and manoeuvrable around town, but motorway runs are far too loud, and winding roads are no fun The Atto 3’s suspension is nice and soft, so around town it irons out lumps and bumps in a very comfortable fashion. Forward visibility, thanks to the low-set dashboard, is very good but the small back window means that the view rearwards is much less impressive. There is a reversing camera, but it’s too easily caked in road grime, and doesn’t have its own washer system. The image is high-quality though, and there’s a useful 3D all-round view, as well as a ‘transparent bonnet’ view should you need to pick your way over rocks or something. Meanwhile, the fat front windscreen pillar means that your view into corners and junctions isn’t great. It’s easy to manoeuvre; the steering is light, and the 10.7-metre turning circle means that flitting around tight roundabouts and pulling U-turns isn’t much of a problem. However, the ‘woooo’ of the pedestrian warning hum, made so that people can hear the car coming, is a constant low-speed companion and makes it sound like you’re being followed by the souls of the undead. It’s a bit eerie. The Atto 3’s 201hp electric motor makes getting up to motorway speeds a piece of cake; it picks up smartly and accelerates briskly. However, there’s a big problem when you get above 60mph and that’s wind noise. There’s lots of it, especially around the wing mirrors. It’s like being on holiday in a caravan on a Welsh clifftop. Efficiency is okay, but no more than that. We averaged 3.3 miles per kWh on our test, which equals a real-world range of 190 miles, against the claimed 260-mile range. It’s not the worst, but you might expect better from a company that makes lots of noise about having started as a battery manufacturer, and which designs and builds all its batteries in-house. There is a sport mode for the BYD Atto 3, which you activate with a little toggle switch on the centre console. However, it doesn’t actually seem to do anything other than light up little green ‘SPORT’ letters in the instrument panel. No sharper steering. No more oomph from the electric motor. Just…why? That soft suspension, which works so nicely around town, is much less welcome here as the Atto 3 just never seems to settle down properly. It’s constantly moving about, like someone trying to walk on hot sand on a beach holiday, and it makes for an uneasy sensation on bumpy roads. There’s an odd feeling with the regenerative braking too, where if you press the brake pedal lightly and then lift off the brakes, the braking effect seems to continue for a couple of seconds. There’s quite a bit of throttle delay too. The steering is very light and remote. It’s almost like steering the Mars Rover by remote from Houston. It’s a shame, as the Atto 3 actually corners quite well by medium crossover standards, it’s just that there’s no communication from the road to the steering wheel, so you never quite trust it. An MG 4 is way better to drive. It is at least quite quick. The Atto 3 will pretty easily equal, even beat, its claimed 7.3sec 0-60mph time, even with a little touch of wheelspin, if you floor it from a standstill. Space and practicality Space and practicality The Atto 3 is generally practical, but bootspace and rear headroom are lacking compared to some of its EV SUV alternatives The front of the Atto 3’s cabin is packed with storage solutions; a space under the front armrest, a pair of big cup holders in front of that with an adjustable base and a storage space in front of the gear selector with a wireless phone charger built in. The glovebox is decently sized, and there’s a useful open storage area under the centre console where you’ll also find USB sockets and a 12-volt connector. It would be a crime not to mention the door pockets, which are reasonably big but come with four elastic strings to hold things in. These strings look like a guitar, and BYD has styled the door panels and stereo speakers to amp that effect up; the strings are actually taut enough that you can strum them and pick out a bass-line. Odd, but also oddly enjoyable if you’re bored in traffic. The front seats are comfy but strangely, although they’re electrically adjustable, there’s no lumbar support adjustment which could spell backache on long drives. Space in the back of the Atto 3 is mixed. There’s lots of room for legs, knees and feet and the flat rear floor helps if you’re trying to squeeze someone into the centre rear seat. Headroom is a bit too tight, though, especially with the panoramic glass roof, which comes as standard. Conversely, the roof helps a bit if you’re trying to go three-abreast, as opening the sunblind actually offers the person sat in the middle an inch more headroom. It’s a bit of a squeeze even so; the Kia Niro EV is a better bet for rear seat space. However, there are some handy seat-back pockets which are subdivided so that there’s a big space for a tablet or a magazine, and then two smaller parts for phones or sunglasses. Another bonus are the coverless ISOFIX anchor points (with more ISOFIX points in the front passenger seat), so it’s easy to click baby seats into place. The guitar-string door bins make another appearance in the back (an encore, perchance?), but imagine what will happen when your kids realise they can be plucked… The Atto 3’s 440-litre boot is decent, but the MG ZS gives you an extra 30 litres for considerably less cash, while the Kia Niro EV has 35 litres more than the BYD. At least the Atto 3 out-points the Peugeot e-2008 and Vauxhall Mokka Electric's respective 408 and 310 litres. On the upside, the loadspace is square and flat, and there’s no load lip so it’s easy to get heavy, bulky items in and out. The rear seats fold almost totally flat, and while there are no handles in the boot to tumble them forwards, it’s easy enough to lean in and flick the release catch. There are no retainers for the rear seatbelts though, so they’re bound to get caught or stuck behind the seatbacks. Oh, and the low-set boot release button gets covered in road grime, so you’re going to end up with messy fingers. On the upside, there’s a false floor under which you can store your charging cables and, fortunately, enough room to tuck the rigid luggage cover away when you don’t need it. There’s no front-boot in the Atto 3, which is odd as there’s a recessed space above the front-mounted electric motor that easily swallows a squashy bag or a backpack, yet BYD has chosen not to put a lined storage space in there. Pity. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories There's some clever tech on-board the Atto 3, but the busy interior design won’t be to everyone’s tastes The Atto 3’s interior is far removed from its plain exterior, and in some ways it’s quite over-styled. The design is, apparently, supposed to mimic a gym. Yes, actually. The big, chunky air vents are supposed to look like dumb-bells - though the swoopy dash shapes remind us more of some of the supporting cast from Return of the Jedi. The gear selector too, which looks like the throttle lever of an Airbus, could easily have come from the Millennium Falcon. What’s less questionable is the excellent 15.6-inch touchscreen in the centre of the dash. The screen is responsive, and the smartphone-style menu and icons work well. Appropriately, you can connect via Apple CarPlay and Android Auto to mirror your phone. The screen’s party piece is that, at the touch of a button (either a physical one on the steering wheel or a virtual one on the screen) the whole screen rotates from a horizontal landscape layout to an upright portrait layout, or vice versa. Portrait mode is arguably better for sat-nav but it does take away some forward visibility. If you’re wearing polarised sunglasses though, the screen basically disappears in portrait mode (something to do with the angles the screen’s pixels work at) so bear that in mind, and Apple CarPlay/Android Auto don’t work in portrait mode. Shame. The little screen behind the wheel, which is your instrument panel, is tiny compared to the big central screen, and although it’s clear and easy to read, the one on our test car did appear to be sitting at a slight angle, which doesn’t say much for the Atto’s build quality. The material quality of the upper parts of the cabin is very good, with lots of soft-touch surfaces and plenty of buttery-soft vegan leather . Lower down though, the plastics get very hard and rough-edged, so much so that you can easily get grazed when using the steering column adjuster. There are some more odd touches; the interior door handles are big, flat rocker switches which rotate around the little stereo speakers. Those speakers have inset LED lights which can be made to pulse to the beat of whatever you’re listening to, and there’s even an optional karaoke system built into the screen… The front seats are very comfortable, and the imitation leather looks and feels nice, but some might find them to be a little too soft at times. A bit more lumbar support would be helpful for longer journeys. Electric range, charging and tax Electric range, charging and tax Being electric, the Atto 3 is only subject to the minimum road tax rate of £10 for the first year and £195 per year thereafter. It also scrapes by in avoiding the luxury car tax supplement, even in higher-spec Design trim. If you’re a company car driver, you’re only going to get stung for two per cent Benefit in Kind (BIK) tax. The range, as we’ve mentioned above, isn’t great. In theory, you should be able to get 260 miles out of a full charge, but in the real world, that’s closer to — even under at times — 200 miles, which is not brilliant. The battery isn’t the quickest thing to charge, either. In spite of BYD’s boasts of advanced battery tech, the maximum DC charging speed when you’re using a high-speed public charging point is 88kW. A Volkswagen ID.4 will charge at 135kW. For slower charging, basic Atto 3 models will charge at 7.4kW from a home charger, but you can optionally boost that to 11kW. This makes better use of kerb-side chargers, but is still well behind the 22kW AC charging offered by Renault and Nissan . To be honest, given BYD’s battery expertise (the battery in the laptop or phone you’re reading this on is quite likely to be made by BYD) we’d have expected better on this front. One nice feature, though, is the bi-directional charging , which allows you to use the Atto’s battery to charge other things, such as an e-bike or e-scooter, or even in extreme circumstances another electric car. It also means that if you have a smart electric meter at home, you could use it to power your house in the event of a power cut. Safety and security Safety and security The Atto 3 was crash-tested by Euro NCAP in 2022 and scored a full five-star rating, with a 91 per cent adult protection score, which is right at the top end of its class. Child occupant safety came in at an impressive 89% too, which is very reassuring for families - especially with the Atto 3’s trio of ISOFIX anchor points. All versions of the BYD Atto 3 come with plenty of safety tech, including blind spot detection, traction control, adaptive (that is, radar-guided) cruise control, traffic sign recognition, automatic emergency braking, lane-keeping steering, and rear collision warning. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems The Atto 3 is a fairly new car made by - relatively speaking - a car maker in its infancy, so we simply don’t have a good fix on how reliable it might be yet. BYD didn’t even feature in the 2024 Driver Power owner satisfaction survey, for example. In general, electric cars are more reliable than their petrol or diesel equivalents, owing to their simplicity, but the Atto is electronically complex and some of the build quality in the cabin is less than perfect, which could be a worry. The Atto 3 comes with a four-year, 70,000-mile warranty for the whole car, which is extended to eight years and 90,000 miles for the electric motor and its control unit, and eight years and 120,000 miles for the battery pack. That’s not too bad, considering most of its European alternatives only come with three-year, 60,000-mile cover. Still, Toyota and Lexus lead the warranty way with up to ten-years or 100,000 miles of warranty cover with regular main dealer servicing. BYD Atto 3 FAQs BYD Atto 3 FAQs"
https://www.carwow.co.uk/byd/sealion-7,BYD Sealion 7 Review & Prices,"€62,010",7/10,new,"Is the BYD Sealion 7 a good car? Is the BYD Sealion 7 a good car? The BYD Sealion 7 is a roomy electric SUV with sporty looks, impressive specs and a very reasonable price tag - on paper, a brilliant alternative to electric vehicles such as the Tesla Model Y , Kia EV6 or Peugeot E-3008 . BYD’s models can be a bit hit and miss, though. The Seal and Dolphin are really good electric cars, but the Seal U plug-in hybrid SUV is rather disappointing. The Sealion 7 is a mixed bag - it's not as outwardly brilliant as the Seal, but it's far better than the Seal U and a credible alternative to the aforementioned Tesla. The Sealion 7 gets off to a reasonable start because while it’s not exactly handsome, it’s a bit less anonymous than the Seal U. BYD’s signature headlight design features C-shape LEDs, sat above a chunky bumper design with big air intakes. A sleek, sloping roofline trails rearward to a tailgate spoiler and a full-width rear lightbar. Inside, things are a bit less lukewarm - it’s genuinely nice inside, with posh-feeling materials swaddling every surface and an interesting dashboard design covered in flowing lines. There’s a huge 15.6-inch infotainment screen with BYD’s trademark rotating party trick - this is cool the first few times, but is likely to be relegated to gimmick status after you’ve shown your mates. Range: 283-312 miles Battery size: 82.5kWh / 91.3kWh Max charge speed: 150kW / 230kW Charge time DC: 32mins, 10-80%, 150kW / 24mins, 10-80%, 230kW Charge port location: Right side rear Power outputs: 313hp / 530hp There are some materials that feel a little bit cheap considering that the Sealion 7 isn’t a budget machine, but overall it feels quite premium - even if it’s lacking the wow factor of a Peugeot E-3008. No such caveats when it comes to the space on offer, though. The front seats are big, squashy and comfortable, and the storage solutions for smaller items are useful - but the back seats are huge, so rear passengers will be able to stretch out as much as they’d like. You won’t have any issues fitting lanky teens or bulky child seats back here, though the middle seat backrest is quite uncomfortable so it’s certainly better for two people. At 520 litres in capacity, boot space can’t hold a candle to the Tesla Model Y but it’s pretty good compared with most other alternatives. There’s a deep underfloor storage compartment and even a useful ‘frunk’ where you’d find the engine on a combustion-powered car. The Sealion 7 offers a choice of two large battery packs, with a claimed range of between 283-312 miles. That sounds good on paper, but during our testing we saw really poor efficiency which would suggest that even the larger battery will only return a figure in the 200s. Not so good. It is powerful, though, and the motors are smooth and silent, so getting up to speed on the motorway is easy. It’s a shame that the rest of the car isn’t quite as refined - there’s a lot of wind noise and tyre roar. Worse still, the Sealion 7’s suspension feels very unsettled. It bounces a lot over bumps, and you can feel the body moving long after you've passed a road imperfection. It’s like being in a rather unstable ship at sea. On top of this, twitchy and hyperactive steering means it’s not even much fun to drive down a twisting B-road, which is a shame. The Sealion 7 is an interesting left-field choice if you value technology and passenger space, but the alternatives all have more enticing driving dynamics and better range, for less cash.

How much is the BYD Sealion 7? Unlike many Chinese cars, the BYD Sealion 7 isn't notably cheaper than the opposition. The Comfort model with rear-wheel drive and a smaller battery starts from £47,000, and there's a straightforward walkup to £52,000 for the small battery, AWD Design model and then £59,000 for the Excellence with AWD and the larger battery pack. Trim differences are minimal, and all come very well equipped. That pricing is pretty well in line with the Tesla Model Y, Hyundai Ioniq 5 and VW ID5 - all strong alternatives. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort Smooth motors make inner-city progress fuss-free, but the Sealion 7 struggles with bumps and it’s noisy inside The BYD Sealion 7 is easy to drive around town thanks to its smooth electric motors. The throttle is nicely calibrated so it’s easy to pull away smoothly, unlike many EVs that can be a bit jumpy as soon as you touch the pedal. The brakes are similarly smooth with lots of travel that makes them easy to judge; again, many electric cars have grabby brakes that are difficult to get to grips with, though regenerative braking isn’t particularly strong and there’s no one-pedal system, so you always need the brakes to come to a stop. Unfortunately the suspension doesn’t deal with bumps too well, so you’re jostled about a bit – likely to be even more of a problem on Britain’s broken roads than it was on our relatively smooth route around Frankfurt. You sit (very) high, which means visibility is good out of the front, but rear visibility is poor because of chunky pillars and a small rear window. You do at least get some cameras that cover your blind spots to make maneuvering easier. While it’s fine to drive around town, the BYD Sealion feels more compromised at high speeds. As soon as you get up to about 60mph there’s a lot of wind noise rushing around the front pillars, and if you sit in the back there’s a lot of tyre roar to contend with. You also notice a deep, bassy boom over bumps, which also tend to send a judder through the cabin. At least its powerful motors mean that motorway slip roads and overtakes are a breeze. EVs typically run out of puff at higher speeds, but squeeze the throttle at 60mph and you get a noticeable surge to 70mph, which is welcome. Annoyingly the steering is rather hyperactive, with the car reacting to tiny inputs, which means you feel like you’re constantly adjusting to stay centred in your lane; coupled with the intrusive assistance technology, it means you can never quite relax into a long drive. Out in the countryside the disappointing suspension causes some issues again, because uneven roads unsettle the car quite a bit, which doesn’t give you much confidence to enjoy a twisty road. It doesn’t help that you sit so high, because you feel the car’s body leaning more than you would if you could sit a bit lower. The brakes are less intuitive at higher speeds too, because there’s not much feedback through the pedal, so you’re not totally sure how much pressure you’re applying, making smooth progress a bit of a guessing game. If you want an electric SUV with more twisty road appeal, the Ford Mustang Mach-e is a good place to start. Space and practicality Space and practicality Really spacious interior and a useful boot, though the driving position isn’t great Space up front is good – you don’t feel too cramped, but the BYD Sealion 7 doesn’t feel intimidatingly large on the road, either. The only real complaint is that you sit very high, even in the seat’s lowest setting, so finding the ideal driving position can be tricky, even though the steering wheel has quite a bit of adjustment. Storage is good – the door bins will fit a small bottle and some odds and ends, and there are two cupholders with an adjustable floor to help grab longer bottles. The space under the armrest is pretty big, and there’s another area beneath the centre console to hide a small bag. Probably the highlight of the BYD Sealion 7 is just how roomy it is in the back seats. You get acres of legroom and headroom, and the seats recline, which makes it feel pretty luxurious. The other positive is that this means there’s plenty of room for a big child seat, and the ISOFIX points are easy to get to. There’s space for three, but the middle seat is really uncomfortable thanks to the way the armrest juts out into your back, so you wouldn’t want to sit there for long. Again, storage is fine. You get pockets in the seatbacks ahead of you, with space for larger items as well as smaller pockets for phones and snacks. There are two USB-C slots between the front seats, though they’re hidden inside a flip-down cover that looks like it might have been home to an ashtray in a former life. At 520 litres the BYD Sealion 7’s boot is a useful size, even if that capacity does put it at the lower end of average compared with alternatives. It’s bigger than the 490 litres in the Kia EV6, around the same as the BMW iX2 (525 litres) and Lexus RZ (522 litres), and less than the Peugeot E-3008 (588 litres) and class-leading Tesla Model Y (854 litres). Some of its capacity comes from the large underfloor storage area beneath the main boot floor, which is good for hiding lesser-used items or valuables. There’s not too much of a lip to lift items over, and you get some netting to one side to keep small things from rolling around. Want somewhere else to hide your stuff? The BYD Sealion gets a front boot, too. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories Great on-board technology, but design and material quality isn't quite as good as similarly priced alternatives First impressions are pretty good when you jump inside the BYD Sealion 7. Everything looks fairly premium and you get a big infotainment display in the centre of the dashboard. That is the highlight – it’s a 15.6-inch display with pin-sharp graphics and a fast processor that makes it tablet-quick to use. Navigating between menus is fairly logical, and the voice activation system works flawlessly. It also gets the BYD-signature feature that lets you rotate it between horizontal and vertical. You get Android Auto and Apple CarPlay for seamless smartphone linking, there’s a nifty two-phone wireless charging pad with a cooling vent to prevent overheating, and the Dynaudio sound system is fantastic. Once you start to really look around, though, you start to notice where the Sealion 7 is not quite up to the standard of a circa £55,000 car, as we tested the top-spec version. It's not bad for the most part, but there are some shiny, cheap-feeling plastics, and some criss-crossing materials and designs that make it look a bit fussy. A BMW iX2 feels posher inside, a Peugeot E-3008 is more characterful, and the Lexus RZ feels more solid. The entry-level model is likely to feel like better value. Electric range, charging and tax Electric range, charging and tax You have a choice of two battery and motor options in the BYD Sealion 7. The Comfort and Design trims come with an 82.5kWh battery, paired to a single- and dual-motor setup respectively. Top-spec Excellence models get the dual-motor, all-wheel drive system with a larger 91.3kWh battery. As a result, official range figures sit at 300 miles for Comfort models, 283 miles for the Design trim, and 312 miles in the Excellence. Long-range versions of alternatives promise more range, such as the Peugeot E-3008 (422 miles) and Tesla Model Y (373 miles), though the entry-level battery’s claimed figure is higher than other equivalent models. However, during our test in the top-spec, big battery model, we saw very poor economy. Our route included some high-speed Autobahn sections that would have made this worse than you’d expect to see in typical UK driving, but even taking that into consideration, a real-world range estimate wouldn’t be much above 200 miles, which is a long way off the claimed figure. We’ll put this to the test again in the UK soon to get an accurate figure over a longer period of time. All versions get 11kW AC charging , which is useful if you have access to these speeds – most EVs are limited to around 7kW, as this is what most home chargers output. Fast charging speeds are 150kW for Comfort and Design models, which gives you a pretty average 32 minutes to go from 10-80%. More impressive is the Excellence trim’s larger battery, which can hit 230kW resulting in a very respectable 24 minutes from 10-80%. As with all electric vehicles, the BYD Sealion 7 gets ultra-low Benefit-in-Kind tax, making it appealing to company car drivers, while you don’t have to pay any Vehicle Excise Duty until April 2025. Safety and security Safety and security The BYD Sealion 7 has been awarded a full five-star rating from Euro NCAP , and performed well in the adult occupant (87%) and safety assist (79%) categories. You get loads of assistance kit, such as adaptive cruise control , front and rear parking sensors, 360-degree parking cameras, and lane departure warning. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems With BYD being fairly new to the UK it’s tricky to build a picture of its reliability, and still having sold relatively few cars, it hasn’t featured in the Driver Power owner satisfaction survey yet. However, you do get a decent warranty of six years or 93,750 miles, whichever comes first. That’s up there with the longest standard manufacturer warranties in the UK.

https://www.carwow.co.uk/byd/seal,BYD Seal Review & Prices,"€55,230",8/10,new,"Is the BYD Seal a good car? Is the BYD Seal a good car? The BYD Seal is a bit like the kid who joins the school halfway through Year 11 and yet finishes the year as rugby captain, prefect and top of the exam tables. You see, while BYD has only been selling cars in the UK since summer 2023, the Seal is an electric saloon car that displays maturity and ability that you’d expect from a highly established European manufacturer. In fact, in many ways it’s actually an improvement on the Tesla Model 3 and Hyundai Ioniq 6 which constitute its two closest alternatives. Other electric cars you might consider are the Polestar 2 and BMW i4 . While BYD may have launched the Sealion 7 and Seal U in the years since, the Seal is still a better car than either. Ignore the slightly odd naming convention for a while, though, and focus for a second on the styling - which is great. The Seal is a similar shape to the Tesla Model 3, being a saloon car with a dropped snout and rounded roofline - but it has more intricate detailing around the headlights and a neat lightbar at the rear. It’s a bit less anonymous than the Tesla without being too glam. On the inside, though, it’s like BYD’s stylists took one look at Tesla’s minimalist approach and simply said ‘no, thank you’. The dashboard is very distinctive as a result, with air vents that seamlessly mould into full-width panels running across the cabin. There are posh quilted seats and a panel of switchgear in the centre. It all feels quite upmarket, if unconventional. Range: 323-354 miles Efficiency: 3.4-3.7mi/kWh Battery size: 83kWh Max charge speed: 150kW Charge time DC: 37mins, 10-80%, 150kW Charge port location: Right side rear Power outputs: 313hp / 530hp Even more unconventional is the infotainment screen, which is a huge 15.6-inches across. BYD’s party piece is that the screen physically rotates from portrait to landscape at the touch of a button. The company says this is because things like the sat-nav are better in portrait mode, but as the standard-fit Apple CarPlay and Android Auto only works in landscape you’ll probably leave the rotating trick as a once-in-a-blue-moon showoff rather than a regular feature. The interface isn’t quite as good as you get in a Model 3 or Ioniq 6, either. The BYD Seal’s screen is bright, clear and responsive, but common functions are buried just a few menus too deep with buttons that are too hard to hit on the move. Drivers and front passengers of all sizes will be able to get comfy up front in those squashy, quilted leather seats, and there’s good stowage for smaller items too. The back seats are a bit more of a squeeze, with decent legroom but headroom that’s limited by the huge panoramic glass roof. Boot space of 402 litres matches the Ioniq 6 but trails the Model 3. There is a handy front boot for storing charge cables, though. Just note that, as a saloon car, the Seal isn’t as practical for large items as a Polestar 2. To drive, the Seal is deeply impressive. Even the standard rear-wheel drive model is quick, but performance from the all-wheel drive, 530hp Excellence version is mind-bending and, unlike a Tesla, totally repeatable. Responsive and accurate steering, plus suspension that strikes a great balance between comfort and cornering, means it’s even a good amount of fun on a twisty road. Competitive range figures of 323 - 354 miles are the icing on the cake, though it’s a shame there’s no super-long range version to challenge the best Tesla Model 3. Still, the BYD Seal is a car that should definitely be on your shortlist. Interested? Check out our best BYD Seal deals here , or get a great price on a BYD Seal lease .

How much is the BYD Seal? There are two BYD Seal options, with the Design RWD and Excellence AWD options divided more by power and driven wheels than by extra equipment, though there are a couple of differences to help maintain the £3,000 gap between them. The rear-wheel drive Design model is the cheaper of the two, offering 313hp and a 354-mile range. Stepping up to the all-wheel drive Excellence cuts the range figure to 323 miles as the second motor boosts power to a hefty 530hp. In addition, the Excellence also gets a head-up display and clever suspension system, but the majority of the benefit of going up to the higher trim level is the stonking performance. Put up against the Tesla Model 3, the Seal has a higher entry price but the Excellence AWD undercuts the Model 3 Performance by more than £10,000. For the performance, in fact, the Seal Excellence is just about the best value this side of an MG4 XPower - you’d have to pay £55,000 for a Polestar 2 Performance Pack, or over £70,000 for a BMW i4 M50. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort The BYD Seal impresses with its nimbleness and composure on flowing and twisting roads, although rippled surfaces can have a surprisingly unsettling impact on the comfort The Seal impresses for the way it handles bigger bumps and road imperfections in particular, and it’s a comfortable and serenely refined way to plot your way around town. It’s a shame there aren’t more levels of brake regeneration - you just get the normal mode and one that increases the regen, slowing the car when you come off the accelerator, but there’s no clever one-pedal driving mode as you find in the Nissan Leaf , for example. And the brakes are annoyingly grabby at lower speeds, so it's difficult to come to a smooth stop. Visibility is reasonable up-front, although the Seal does sit sleek and low, so you’ve not got an SUV-style higher driving position to enjoy. But all cars get front and rear parking sensors and a 360-degree camera, and the Seal has a decent turning circle, so there’s no excuse for getting in a mess while parking, even though the view out the back window is poor. The odd unsettled feeling over some road surfaces manifests itself most strongly at higher speeds, so sometimes the car can feel really jittery beneath you on some roads, but then switch to a different piece of asphalt and it’s much more pleasant. Which is a bit odd. Otherwise, either model has plenty of performance to get you up to motorway speed on a slip road, and it’s quiet and refined when you get there, bearing in mind the faster you go, the more you’re taking range out of the battery via reduced efficiency. There’s a complete suite of safety and assistance systems to keep you safe on longer journeys, and either Seal has a good enough range to mean you’ll be stopping for a break before you run out of charge. But the lower-powered Design model has an extra 31 miles of range for higher-mileage users or those most worried about range anxiety. This is where the Seal particularly impresses, proving to be surprisingly adept and nimble when the road goes tighter and twistier, which is no mean feat for a car weighing over two tonnes, and helped by BYD’s latest tech that builds the battery into the shell of the car, rather than attaching it to the body. The Seal manages to minimise body roll and entices you to have fun in a way most electric vehicles don’t. It’s frustrating that you have to plot your way through touchscreen menus to switch on some of the driving modes, such as sportier settings, by which time the moment has probably passed. It's not quite as sporty as a Tesla Model 3, and doesn't feel quite as punchy out of corners, but there's certainly plenty of fun to be had in the Seal – and in all-wheel drive guise, it actually accelerates faster than than the Tesla, which is no mean feat. Space and practicality Space and practicality Decent practicality and space up front, although the boot space can’t match the best electric saloons The cabin initially impresses for quality and design, with a nice mix of materials making it eye-catching. There’s a huge stowage area at floor level for stashing a decent-sized bag, and you’ll find a single USB and a USB-C in the front, along with a pair of cupholders and a decent stowage area under the armrest. The glovebox is of reasonable size, as are the doorbins, but they’re not lined and are of cheaper plastic than most of the cabin, which is a shame. The other main area where cheaper plastic is very evident is the handle you use to pull the door open from the inside, which is a really odd thing to cut cost on as you touch it every time you get out of the car. Another oddity is that the air vents aren’t adjustable for angle, but they’re illogical features of an otherwise logical and pleasant cabin space. Although it’s a shame the door design doesn’t properly cover the sills, so you drag your trouser leg across a damp and dirty sill when getting out of the car. There’s a good amount of legroom in the back, and headroom is decent despite the sweeping roofline that does rob some height. That’s most noticeable for taller people that will have to duck a touch when getting in and out, but once they’re in it’s absolutely fine, and you’ll have a lovely view of the sky through the huge panoramic glass roof that stretches impressively far back behind the rear passenger. There's a bit more space in a Tesla Model 3, but not by much. The rear seat leaves occupants in a bit of an odd position, which is down to having a slightly reclined back, combined with the car’s low profile meaning the seats are quite low to the floor. There’s no SUV-style footwell, and the end result is that your knees are sitting slightly above your hips, which isn’t the most supportive of positions. Not the end of the world, but it’s not helped by it being tricky to squeeze feet below the front seats, slightly limiting rear passenger’s range of options. The space itself is good though, and rear passengers have a pair of power sockets to fight over - one old-style USB and a newer and more powerful USB-C. The ISOFIX fixing is easily accessible behind a flexible plastic flap, and the doors open nice and wide so it's easy to get a child seat in, one area where the BYD wins over the Tesla. You also get a reasonably sized door bin on each side as well as a fold-down arm-rest with a pair of cupholders. At 400 litres, the BYD Seal’s boot is a reasonable size - enough to take the family away for the weekend while still being adrift of the other main electric saloons. And by adrift, we mean a single litre and just five litres in the case of the Hyundai Ioniq 6 and Polestar 2 specifically, but the BMW i4 boasts 470 litres and the Tesla Model 3 a huge 594 litres, plus another 88 in the front trunk. Unlike the BMW, the Seal has a handy additional front load area, which at 53 litres is plenty to stash the charging cables away from the rest of your luggage. Or there’s also underfloor space in the actual boot. What there isn’t is tie-down points or power sockets, but you do get a little luggage net to one side for smaller items. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories It’s a very pleasant cabin environment and the touchscreen looks good but unfortunately is horrendously difficult to use on the move, and almost every function is buried somewhere in a menu As mentioned earlier, the cabin quality and design impresses when you drop into the BYD Seal, with the big touchscreen dominating the centre of the interior. And that screen has a hidden trick up its sleeve, switching from landscape to portrait layout at the touch of a button, as already seen in the Atto 3 and Dolphin models. Though it’s largely theatre rather than usefulness, rotating the screen is handy when using the navigation in particular. In general, the 15.6-inch touchscreen looks better and is more usable in landscape form, but when using the navigation, rotating it to portrait gives greater visibility up the map. Although that’s only on the car’s in-built sat nav; Apple CarPlay or Android Auto are only usable in landscape form at the moment. (At least you get this smartphone mirroring, though, unlike in a Tesla.) That’s where the praise of the touchscreen ends, though. Too many functions are buried too deep in the menus, taking five or six button presses to go into the climate or driving function menus to change settings and then return to Apple CarPlay, for example. It’s just too difficult to do quickly without taking your eyes off the road for prolonged periods. BYD is far from the only culprit (anything from Tesla and the Volvo EX30 are other obvious offenders), but the constant attempts to remove buttons and replace with touchscreen functionality has gone too far in terms of being able to safely adjust settings while driving. It needs some basic shortcuts. The dashboard itself is clear and has a good array of displays, although the left-hand third of the dash has a distracting large dial showing charge status at that moment, and the numbers jump around and catch the eye at the expense of the more relevant speedo display. At least the higher-spec car has a head-up display . One bit of cleverness that is worth flagging is that you can adjust the volume of both the audio and the navigation using one of the few buttons left in the cabin. Next to the gear lever is a volume scroll, and on the touchscreen you can toggle between audio and navigation instruction volumes, making it about the simplest way to mute spoken guidance of any car on sale. Electric range, charging and tax Electric range, charging and tax There are a pair of power options with the Seal, with power being the main differentiator between the two trim levels. The cheaper car is the Design rear-wheel drive model, which offers 313hp, while the Excellence all-wheel drive car takes the power up to 530hp thanks to the second electric motor. The more efficient is the less powerful, as you’d expect, with respective official range figures of 354 and 323 miles from the 82.5kWh battery, which equates to decent efficiency of 4.3miles/kWh or 3.9miles/kWh respectively. BYD quotes a charging time of 26 minutes to go from 30-80% at a charging speed of up to 150kW, which is reasonable if not up with the best speeds. It’s also worth noting that a heat pump, which helps battery efficiency, is fitted as standard. As with all electric vehicles, tax conditions are favourable compared to petrol or diesel, especially if you take it as a company car , where all full EVs sit in the lowest tax banding. But Vehicle Excise Duty is also at the lowest level if you drive an EV, although won’t be exempt from 2025, and you dodge the VED penalty in years two through to six for cars costing over £40,000. Safety and security Safety and security The Seal has been tested by safety specialist Euro NCAP , and was awarded the maximum five stars, performing well across the board but especially around vulnerable road user protection. The list of standard safety kit fitted to every Seal is vast, with highlights including lane change assist, intelligent cruise control , blind spot detection, seven airbags and door opening warning. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems As a new brand to the UK, there’s little evidence either way on BYD reliability, although it has plenty of experience of building electric cars in China. But BYD has moved to increase confidence in its products by offering a six-year or 93,750-mile warranty, double that which comes with the likes of BMW, Audi or Mercedes, while the battery and electric motor are covered for eight years, with mileage limits of 125,000 and 93,750 miles respectively. The battery’s warranty guarantees at least 70% operational capacity. BYD Seal FAQs BYD Seal FAQs"
https://www.carwow.co.uk/byd/seal-u,BYD Seal U Review & Prices,"€42,898",6/10,new,"Is the BYD Seal U a good car? Is the BYD Seal U a good car? It’s not immediately obvious what sort of car the BYD Seal U is from the name alone - it sounds like it should be related to the all-electric BYD Seal saloon. However, it’s instead a plug-in hybrid family-sized SUV which majors on value - coming in comfortably cheaper than many much smaller hatchbacks and SUVs. It’s also quite a frustrating car, as it doesn’t do things by halves. In some aspects it’s good - very good, arguably near the top of its class. In others, however, it’s firmly near the bottom, making it difficult to recommend. It’s like buying products from Temu or Aliexpress - they can be very good or very bad, but rarely are they just average. The Seal U is a similar size to plug-in hybrid SUVs such as the Hyundai Tucson , Ford Kuga and Volkswagen Tiguan , but it’s closer in price to cars such as the Kia Niro or Jeep Renegade , both of which are a lot smaller. The closest alternative is the MG HS , which comes in at a similar size and a similar price for its plug-in hybrid variant. The BYD Seal U starts on the back foot because of its design. Whereas BYD’s other cars are at least distinctive if not particularly pretty, the Seal U looks like every other SUV was popped into a blender. It’s so anonymous that it would make the perfect getaway car, but the result is that you don’t feel particularly proud or excited to be climbing aboard. At least you’ll have plenty of room inside. Space in the front and rear seats is excellent, with space for a six-foot passenger to stretch out behind a driver of a similar size. The boot isn’t quite so impressive, at 425 litres in capacity - most alternatives offer more room. It’s still a useful space, though, as it’s deep and wide - just not very tall. Those sat up front enjoy loads of tech as standard, and a cabin design that’s rather more distinctive than the exterior styling. You get BYD’s trademark rotating touchscreen infotainment system - 15.6-inches across, it’s huge, clear and responsive, even if the interface doesn’t always make the most sense. Other luxurious features include things like full-cabin air purification, which senses when there are lots of pollutants outside (or even inside) the vehicle and can filter them out. It’s driving the Seal U which highlights its Marmite nature more than anything else. The hybrid powertrain is truly excellent, but the rest of the driving experience is very poor. The Seal U runs on its electric motors most of the time, with the petrol engine acting mostly as a generator and only kicking in fully if you put your foot all the way down. That means progress is smooth, if not hugely rapid, and makes the Seal U fantastic for driving around town. Good range on a charge and a generally quiet cabin free of too much wind and road noise further this aspect. But the Seal U’s suspension is so soft that it wallows over bumps like a ship in rough seas, and the steering is so light that it feels as if you’re driving a remote controlled-car. This is especially a shame given that the Seal saloon with which the Seal U (sort of) shares a name is really good to drive. You can check out the latest BYD Seal U deals through Carwow, or browse used BYD cars from our network of trusted dealers, and when it’s time to sell your current car , Carwow can help with that, too. How much does the BYD Seal U cost? How much does the BYD Seal U cost? Okay, so the BYD Seal U isn’t great to drive, but you might not care at all when you find out how much it costs. The entry-level Boost model, which has a smaller battery and front-wheel drive, costs a bit less than plug-in hybrid versions of the Kia Niro and Jeep Renegade, which are much smaller, less practical cars. If you want similarly sized PHEV models, the Seal U is about £6,000 less than a Hyundai Tucson, and £9,000 less than a Volkswagen Tiguan. Both those cars are more practical, nicer inside and better to drive, but those savings are huge. The MG HS is the main alternative, really. It actually costs a fraction less than the Seal U and has a bigger boot, but it's worth bearing in mind that MG came bottom of the latest Driver Power owner satisfaction survey, while BYD is a bit more of an unknown quantity long-term. Even the Seal U's top-spec Design model doesn’t break £40,000, meaning you won’t have to pay any extra annual road tax . For the cash you get an extra electric motor that provides all-wheel drive, and more power overall. Equipment is identical between trims. The mid-spec Comfort model isn’t on sale yet, but when it comes it will have the less powerful petrol engine with a single electric motor, but a bigger battery that offers that impressive 77 miles of electric-only range. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort The hybrid engine is impressively quiet and refined, but otherwise the BYD Seal U is disappointing to drive The BYD Seal U is really easy to drive around town because the suspension is incredibly soft and the steering is really light, so it’s little effort to nip about in traffic. However, that soft suspension means that the car never really settles and feels like it’s always wobbling around over undulations in the road. Then if you hit a pothole or a small speed bump it sends a shudder through the cabin. Fortunately the hybrid system is excellent – the Seal U drives like an electric car, because if you’ve got a good amount of charge you’ll barely use the petrol engine, and when it does kick in to help top the battery up, you can hardly hear a thing. Often this type of hybrid is accompanied by an annoyingly noisy petrol engine that distracts from the smooth EV-like driving experience, so this really is impressive for the Seal U. Visibility is good looking forward, but the rear window is quite small and the view over your shoulder is poor. Assistance kit is hugely impressive though, with front and rear parking sensors and a 360-degree camera making it easier to park in a tight spot. Once up to speed on the motorway the cabin is generally pretty hushed; though a bit of tyre noise is noticeable it’s not too intrusive. Like at town speeds, when the petrol engine is called upon it is really quiet, even when you’re accelerating quickly down a motorway slip road or pulling off an overtake. The suspension is less annoying at higher speeds, but you still get that odd sensation that the car takes a while to settle after undulations in the road. The steering gets a bit heavier at higher speeds, but it feels unnatural, like you have a hint of resistance to push through, which can make smooth lane changes a bit of a challenge. Again though, standard equipment is impressive, with adaptive cruise control that can maintain your speed and distance to the car in front, and a system that keeps you centred in your lane, taking the strain out of longer drives. Yet even this has its issues - the adaptive cruise control tends to pulse the power on and off, making for a positively sickness-inducing experience. We only managed about 10 miles before we had to turn it off. The BYD Seal U isn’t great to drive around town or on the motorway, but it does at least have redeeming features if you’re not too worried about how well a car drives. However, if you want to enjoy taking the scenic route home on a twisty, then this is one SUV to avoid. The steering is so light that you have no idea what the front wheels are doing, meaning it’s difficult to judge where you are on the road, how much steering input is required, and how much grip you have. The body also leans a lot in corners, which is really unnerving. The Ford Kuga is considerably more expensive, but lightyears ahead in terms of driver enjoyment. Space and practicality Space and practicality Cabin storage isn’t amazing, but the BYD Seal U has really roomy back seats and a decent-sized boot The BYD Seal U is pretty roomy for those in the front, and there’s a decent amount of adjustability in the driver’s seat and steering wheel to get a comfortable driving position. Storage is fine but it’s about the minimum you would expect – the door bins are okay but you might struggle to fit a big bottle inside, and the glovebox is an average size. The cubby hole under the armrest is really deep though, making it a great place to hide things out of sight. You get two cup holders ahead of this with grips on the edge so your drink doesn’t fall over, and a pair of wireless phone charging pads beneath the screen. Rear seat space is similarly impressive. If you’re over six-feet tall you might start to feel your head is brushing the headlining surrounding the panoramic glass roof, but it’s fine for most, and even your lankiest friends will have no complaints about kneeroom. The upside of that is the fact that you will be able to fit even the bulkiest of child seats in the back with ISOFIX mounting points in the outer seats. As with the front, though, storage isn’t fantastic, thanks to fairly small door bins and not a lot else. At 425 litres the BYD Seal U’s boot should be adequate for most people most of the time. Similarly priced alternatives such as the Kia Niro (358 litres) generally have smaller capacity boots, though the other bargain SUV, the MG HS, has more at 507 litres. Similarly sized (and much more expensive) options tend to have more boot space. For example, the plug-in hybrid Hyundai Tucson gets a 558-litre boot and the Volkswagen Tiguan has a huge 652 litres on offer. The Seal U’s boot has a square space that’s easy to pack and there are small cubbies at each side to give you somewhere to hold smaller items. There’s basically no underfloor storage though, so if you want to carry your charging cables with you they’ll have to sit in the main boot compartment. You can fold the rear seats but you have to do it using a lever next to the seat, rather than being able to do it from the boot itself. Once the seats are folded there’s 1,440 litres of space available, but there’s a big lip that makes it difficult to push long, heavy items through. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories The infotainment system is excellent and most materials are decent for the price, but the design is pretty plain and cheap plastics are never far away Jump into the driver’s seat of the BYD Seal U and first impressions are pretty good. Sure, the design is pretty plain, with a simple panel across the centre of the dashboard that flows down in the central area between the seats, but the materials all look good quality. Poke and prod around and there aren’t too many squishy plastics, but when you consider that this SUV hugely undercuts similarly sized alternatives on price, it’s more than adequate quality inside. That big central touchscreen is more than adequate, though. It measures a massive 15.6 inches and floats separately from the dashboard. It feels like it could be angled slightly more towards the driver, but the graphics are sharp and it responds instantly to your touch. It’s not the most intuitive menu system to navigate around, but Apple CarPlay and Android Auto work seamlessly and fill the screen. You can also rotate the screen if you prefer it to be portrait-orientated, which is a neat trick. MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax The BYD Seal uses a 1.5-litre petrol engine that works with a single motor in the Boost and Comfort trims to offer front-wheel drive, or two motors in the Design trim that makes it all-wheel drive. In both the Boost and Design trims, the electric motors are powered by an 18.2kWh battery that offers a range of up to 50 miles for Boost models or 43 miles in Design. If you want maximum economy it’s worth waiting for the Comfort model, because that has a 26.6kWh battery that increases the range to a hugely impressive 77 miles. The upshot of this is that official CO2 emissions figures are incredibly low, meaning these models are cheaper for company car users than most hybrids and not far off electric cars, ideal if you’re concerned about going fully electric. For private buyers, all models fall below £40,000, which means you don’t have to pay the extra road tax in years two to six for cars that cost over that threshold. Charging speeds aren’t particularly impressive, with a maximum of just 18kW on public DC chargers meaning it’s almost never going to be worth going to pricey fast chargers when out and about. However, a maximum AC rate of 11kW could be useful if you have access to chargers that can achieve that at home or, more likely, work, though most home charge points have a maximum charge rate of around 7kW. Safety and security Safety and security The BYD Seal U scored the maximum five stars in Euro NCAP safety testing, with impressive ratings across the board. It achieved 90% for adult occupant protection, 86% for child occupants, 83% for vulnerable road users, and 77% for its safety assist systems. With equipment largely identical between trims, you get loads of assistance kit as standard. Some of the highlights include adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping assistance to keep you centred in your lane, alerts for traffic passing in front or behind the car when manoeuvring, and front and rear collision warning. You get the usual ISOFIX points in the outer rear seats, but there’s also another in the front passenger seat. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems It’s unclear how reliable BYD’s cars will be. The brand is very new to the UK and hasn’t sold enough cars to register in the Driver Power ownership survey. You do get an excellent six-year warranty though, with a limit of 93,750 miles if that comes up first. The battery gets a separate eight-year/125,000-mile warranty that guarantees it will retain 70% of its original capacity in that time. BYD Seal U FAQs BYD Seal U FAQs"
https://www.carwow.co.uk/byd/dolphin,BYD Dolphin Review & Prices,"€33,877",8/10,new,"Is the BYD Dolphin a good car? Is the BYD Dolphin a good car? The BYD Dolphin is a mid-sized electric car bringing good levels of equipment and decent practicality, as well as a low starting price – all attributes that make it highly attractive if you're in the market for an EV and you don't want an SUV. Chinese brand BYD launched in the UK with the Atto 3 SUV , and its second model, also all-electric, is the Dolphin. Think of it as a pocket telescope - not impressive in size, but its compact dimensions belie its abilities to show users more than they bargained for. For example, the entry car’s price undercuts potential alternatives such as the MG 4 , and significantly undercuts the likes of the Cupra Born , VW ID3 and Smart #1 , as well as the smaller Renault Zoe and Peugeot e-208 . But equipment levels impress, with kit including electrically adjustable vegan leather seats, a 360-degree surround camera and 12.8-inch rotatable screen all standard on even the entry car. But only the cars over £30,000 get the longer-range battery. And yep, rotatable. At the touch of a button, as long as you’re not using the landscape-only Apple CarPlay/Android Auto, the big infotainment screen will switch from landscape to portrait or back again. Most people will pick a layout and stick with it, but a neat party trick nonetheless. Range: 196-265 miles Efficiency: 3.9-4.1mi/kWh Battery size: 45kWh / 60kWh Max charge speed: 150kW Charge time AC: 5hrs, 0-100%, 11kW / 6hrs 12mins, 0-100%, 11kW Charge time DC: 40mins, 10-80%, 150kW Charge port location: Right side front Power outputs: 95hp / 177hp / 204hp The Dolphin comes in four different trim levels, only two of which offer the same battery, power, range and charging stats. At the bottom is the Active which has 95hp and a 211-mile range, while the top-spec Design has 204hp and 265 miles of range. We’ll go into more detail on the different options later on, and the two lower-price cars aren't available until a couple of months after launch. Once past the slightly odd name, the Dolphin has a subtly inoffensive style to it; nothing likely to court car park controversy, but it’s neat enough. On the inside, there is plenty to catch the eye, from the rounded set of switches below the screen that also house the gear selector, to the sweeping air vent surrounds that form part of a dynamic line across the dashboard. Rear seat space is surprisingly good for a car that doesn’t have a big footprint, with taller adults easily able to get comfortable one behind the other. That’s helped by the flat floor – a result of clever battery packaging – and the fact that you can get your feet just about under the front seats. Three rear passengers will be a squeeze though, which isn’t a big surprise in a fairly compact hatchback. Boot space is reasonable, and there’s a handy removable rubber mat to keep wet dogs or muddy boots off the carpeted moveable boot floor. It’s a deep space when set in the lower position, and offers a little more room that a Smart #1, Renault Zoe or MG 4, although not quite as much as a Volkswagen ID3 or Cupra Born. To drive, the most powerful of the three power options is a little too powerful for the tyres, especially in the wet where they have a tendency to easily spin the wheels. BYD has acknowledged they’re not perfect, and will be changing the tyres it fits to the Dolphin for cars built from November 2023. Otherwise it’s a pleasant and relaxed experience, although the car doesn’t always smooth itself over urban bumps. But it’s grown-up enough to settle in fine on longer runs, and the light steering is welcome for low-speed manoeuvring, although at higher speeds the standard setting is too light for engaging or spirited driving. It can be altered in the menus though, which helps. Much like the Fiat 500e , the Dolphin’s smaller battery should be ignored by anyone venturing far from home. The lower range is fine for urban jaunts, but the extra capacity of the bigger battery provides significant peace of mind. The Dolphin looks neat and tidy without breaking any new ground styling-wise, and is a well-rounded, well-equipped and practical car that opens up the electric hatchback choices even further. See how much a BYD Dolphin costs to buy through Carwow, or check out the full range of BYD models . If you’ve got a vehicle you need to sell to help fund your new purchase, you can also sell your car online through Carwow . How much is the BYD Dolphin How much is the BYD Dolphin The Dolphin has an impressively low starting price for a car this size, although you have to look past the bottom two trim levels and to the Comfort model at just over £30,000 if you want the 265-mile range battery. But all cars are well-equipped, with even the entry Active car, which costs a little over £26,000, getting some surprisingly high-end equipment including electrically adjustable vegan leather seats, 12.8-inch rotating touchscreen, 360-degree camera and 16-inch alloy wheels. Metallic paint, keyless entry, adaptive cruise control and a host of safety kit are all also among what is a comprehensive set of standard equipment on a car at this price point. But the Active entry level car does only come with a 95hp motor and the smaller 44.9kWh battery. Next up is Boost, which for £1,000 upgrades the alloy wheels to 17-inch, adds multi-link rear suspension and swaps the 95hp motor for a 176hp version, although the smaller battery is still present. The step from Boost to Comfort is a larger £3,000, but that does bring in a 60.4kWh battery, as well as a more powerful 204hp motor. That extra cash also brings front parking sensors, heated front seats and an uprated audio system. Then at the top is Design, which for another £1,500 adds a panoramic glass roof, wireless phone charging and rear privacy glass, as well as some neat tri-colour alloy wheels and two-tone paintwork with a different-coloured roof. Oddly, auto wipers aren’t available on any model. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort The top-spec model proves that 204hp is more than enough for a mid-sized hatchback. The Dolphin is, ironically for a sea mammal, most at home in town, and isn’t the most engaging on a country road The strong and instantaneous performance of electric vehicles makes for easy progress around town, as do the car’s small dimensions, and the Dolphin’s light steering is a boon. Visibility isn’t perfect, both the front and rear door pillars are quite thick so the forward view at roundabouts and over-the-shoulder rear visibility isn't optimal. It’s also a shame that the regeneration braking levels when you lift off the accelerator are mild - there’s a normal mode and one to increase the regen, but even on the higher level it’s very mild, where other cars have the ability to come to a halt, rather than having to use the brakes. No one-pedal driving here. Although the ride can be a little hard and imperfections in the road are felt rather than absorbed, the Dolphin copes well with the likes of speed bumps and other urban obstacles. All cars get rear parking sensors and a 360-degree camera – impressive that even the entry car gets that – and the two highest trim levels add front sensors. Other useful kit in town is a warning when you’re about to open the door into the path of another road user, while the top two trims also get folding heated door mirrors. The Dolphin feels grown up and sensible on the motorway; there’s a little road noise but not much wind noise as it cruises along happily at higher speeds. The punchier 204hp motor means you’re quickly up to speed on a slip road or off a roundabout. The safety system count also works well in keeping you secure and reducing fatigue on a long journey. As well as adaptive cruise control and lane keep assist, you’ll find driver fatigue and traffic sign recognition systems. The key thing to make sure your Dolphin doesn’t feel like a porpoise out of water when you hit your favourite B-road is to dive into the touch-screen menus to switch the steering to its sportier setting. Separate to the general Sport setting, there’s a function that transforms the steering weight from its light-and-twirly town feel, to a more meaty weighting that gives you confidence in taking bends. It can’t increase tyre grip though, so until they’re sorted late this year, tread a little carefully on wet roads, especially when accelerating, but it’s otherwise a sensible level of fun. We’re not talking hot hatch fun, but body roll is well controlled so it doesn’t feel like you're throwing passengers around. Space and practicality Space and practicality Impressive interior space, especially for rear passengers, although there’s not a lot of cleverness to the boot area, and no storage under the bonnet Hop into a BYD Dolphin and you’ll find an attractive cabin with plenty of cubby holes and storage. The driving position is easily adjusted thanks to standard electric seats across the whole line-up, and a neat touch is that the small dashboard display moves with the steering wheel so no matter where you move the wheel, you can see it through the spokes. The rotating gear selector is on the end of a short bar of buttons, so neatly tucked away. There are lots of little places to stash wallets or keys, and a huge open area beneath the armrest that’s matched by a huge glovebox. The door bins are more average in size and not lined, so anything dropped into them makes a noise as it slides around, but the doors themselves shut with a reassuring thump that proves we’re not dealing with a cheap car. There are a pair of cupholders that will take a decent-sized bottle or coffee. Back seat passengers will be pleased with your car choice, with tall people able to sit one behind the other in the Dolphin despite the front seats being fairly chunky. It helps that you can just about squeeze your feet under the front seats, which helps in finding a comfortable position, and that the floor is nice and flat. Headroom is just about fine, although the big door pillar makes it a little dark in the back, especially for cars lower than the top-spec Design that don’t have a panoramic glass roof. The rear windows aren’t that big either, which doesn’t help with letting the light in. The middle seat is much narrower than the outer two, so only really suitable for smaller people. Three adults isn’t really an option, unless they’re very good friends. The ISOFIX points are easily accessible, and there are two in the back and one on the front seat. The rear door bins are a reasonable size, although not lined, and rear passengers get a pair of USB sockets, as well as one cupholder to fight over in the middle. Two more appear when you drop the centre armrest. The Dolphin’s boot space is broadly in line with electric hatchbacks at 345 litres, rising to 1,310 with the rear seats folded. That compares with 289 litres in the MG 4, 323 litres in the Smart #1 and 311 in Peugeot’s e-208, while the Renault Zoe is also a touch behind at 338 litres. The more expensive Volkswagen ID3 and Cupra Born each have a luggage area of 385 litres. The Dolphin’s boot is a split floor arrangement, with a big area underneath when it’s in the higher position - more than enough to stash the charging cables. Which is handy as there’s no frunk under the small bonnet. Drop the floor and it’s a decent shape and size for carrying stuff, although that does mean a hefty lip to heave heavier items over. You get pockets either side for keeping smaller things safe, but the parcel shelf feels a bit flimsy. The rear seats drop in a 60:40 configuration, but you need to have the boot floor in the higher position to offer up a flat area to slide longer or chunkier loads across. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories Clever rotating screen is a novelty party piece in a cabin that looks smart and stylish. Infotainment could do with some shortcut buttons though, as too much goes through the screen At first glance the cabin looks great, with plenty of style and different materials making for an interior that’s far from plain. But prodding closer does reveal some of the materials aren’t quite as soft-touch as they look. It’s still nice, but in keeping with the pricing rather than masquerading as a premium car. There are a pair of USBs and a 12V socket up front, as well as a wireless charging pad on top-spec cars. The Dolphin’s biggest party piece is its rotating screen. Yep, the 12.8-inch infotainment screen can rotate from portrait to landscape at the touch of a button. As long as you’re not using Apple CarPlay or Android Auto , where it will stay landscape. It’s a neat trick, if slightly pointless as most people will just stick with the one layout. Fun though. Less good is the lack of shortcut buttons to help navigate between screens. To go from using CarPlay to change the temperature by one degree and back to where you were again is nine presses or swipes, which isn’t massively convenient compared to the old fashioned way of just pressing a button or turning a knob in the cabin. There is also voice control for those inclined to use that functionality, but all-in-all it could be a touch more user-friendly by just retaining a few extra buttons. That would though upset the clean lines of the cabin. Electric range, emissions and tax Electric range, emissions and tax Three different battery and motor combinations across four models seems a bit much, but there’s at least logical progression between them. The entry car is the most efficient, with the 211-mile range from a 44.9kWh battery equating to 4.7 miles per kWh. That’s the Active spec, which comes with a 95hp motor. Next up is the Boost spec, which combines the same battery size with a 176hp motor, and that big rise in power doesn’t help efficiency, with the 193 miles equating to an official 4.3mi/kWh. The top two specifications - Comfort and Design - share the same battery and motor combo, so both offer an official 265-mile range from a bigger 60.4kWh battery, which works out at 4.4mi/kWh. Charging speeds also differ between the two battery sizes. At home, the larger battery is capable of charging at up to 11kW compared with 7kW for the smaller one, and at public charging points the bigger battery can take charge at up to 88kW, which still isn’t that fast, while the smaller takes electrons at a slower rate that BYD hasn’t yet confirmed. But it has said that cars with the larger battery will charge from 10-80% in 40 minutes while the smaller one is just two minutes quicker despite needing less electricity to fill it up. Also worthy of note is that BYD fits a heat pump as standard to all cars. That device helps maintain the vehicle’s range when the temperature drops, which is a recognised problem for EVs when winter comes around. As with all electric vehicles, they’re exempt from congestion charge and low emissions zones, as well as Vehicle Excise Duty , until 2025 at least, where they will drop into the lowest band. Company car tax is also heavily weighted towards electric vehicles. Safety and security Safety and security The Dolphin was awarded a full five stars by Euro NCAP when it was tested in 2023, with high scores given out for adult and child occupants, vulnerable road users and safety assists. Backing up that point is the raft of safety kit included, with all cars getting as standard seven airbags, high-beam assist, driver fatigue detection, adaptive cruise control, blind spot and lane-keep assist functions and an alert to stop you opening the door if there’s something approaching that you’ll step out in front of. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems A worry with any newer brand is reliability, but BYD is backing itself with an impressive six-year, 93,750-mile warranty on the Dolphin, rising to eight years on the drive motor and battery, the latter also extending out to 125,000 miles. BYD is also filling out its dealer network to ensure service and repair facilities are easier to access as it grows its UK presence. BYD Dolphin FAQs BYD Dolphin FAQs"
https://www.carwow.co.uk/gwm/haval-jolion-pro,GWM Haval Jolion Pro Review & Prices,"€31,912",Not found,new,"Is the Haval Jolion Pro a good car? Is the Haval Jolion Pro a good car? To the list of Chinese car brands entering the UK market, you can now add Haval. Except that Haval, while it hasn’t specifically been on sale here before, kind of has already as it’s part of GWM , or Great Wall Motors, the people behind the little GWM Ora 03 . The Jolion Pro at least avoids the overly-cutesy name of its all-electric cousin, although once again you’d have to ask precisely what’s the right way to pronounce it — is it Joe-Lion? Or Jole-Eon? You’d better figure that out as all of your friends are going to be asking exactly what you’ve bought, should you take the Haval plunge. Apparently the name derives from the Mandarin ‘chu lian’, which means ‘first love’. While some Chinese brands are already starting to look upmarket, and to try and compete with the big German brands, Haval is taking a refreshingly straightforward approach with the Jolion — it’s a big-ish SUV , about the same size as a Kia Sportage , but it’s being sold for way less than the price of a Kia Niro , and with lots of standard equipment too. The Jolion has the advantage of looking a bit more conventional than some of the other Chinese cars hitting the UK market. Perhaps a bit too conventional — it certainly doesn’t stand out from the crowd — but it’s certainly not offensive. It’s as if someone passed a Ford Kuga , a Kia Sportage, and a Lexus NX through an AI programme and the Jolion was what came out the other end. In fact, perhaps that’s exactly what happened… Up front, there’s a big grille and slim lights, while from the side the Jolion is going to be seriously easily confused with the Ford . The rear is quite Lexus -y, with a wrapover LED light bar. It’s all neat and pleasant, but without any sense of distinction. Inside, the Jolion looks rather a lot like you’d expect — a big screen, some slightly fussy digital instruments, and a chunky steering wheel that’s one-part Jeep , one-part MG . Overall quality looks OK, if nothing special, and at least there are some proper physical buttons to help with that touchscreen. Oddly, there’s no option to have built-in sat-nav, and there’s also no DAB radio, leaving you stuck with AM/FM unless you have an unlimited data plan for your mobile. Space is excellent, especially in the back seats where there’s almost too much rear legroom. In fact, there really is too much rear legroom, as the space in the rear cabin eats so badly into boot volume that this big, roomy SUV has a boot which measures just 255 litres. For comparison’s sake, the tiny Skoda Fabia hatchback has a 380 litre boot… While you’re getting over that shock, the Jolion does try to calm you down with a very conventional hybrid system. This is based around a four-cylinder 1.5-litre petrol engine, and the combined power output is 190hp, thanks to a very powerful electric motor. 0-62mph takes a claimed 9.0 seconds, which isn’t too bad for a big-ish SUV. As with the Nissan Qashqai e-Power , the idea is that the Jolion’s electric motor does most of the driving, most of the time, while the petrol engine is there to — mostly — charge up the little 1.69kWh battery. However, unlike the Nissan , the Jolion’s engine can chime in and power the front wheels directly when extra thrust is needed. However, for all the electric power on offer, the Jolion’s not very economical. On the official WLTP test, it returns 47mpg, which means that it’s likely going to be closer to 40mpg in real-world conditions, and possibly worse than that. Other cars in this segment do much better than that, not least the aged-but-still-game Toyota RAV4 . There’s no plug-in hybrid model, either. While the Haval Jolion’s styling might give British buyers reassurance that they’re buying something that looks familiar, make sure you read the fine print first — with that thirsty engine and that tiny boot, the Jolion is going to struggle to cash the cheques its bodywork has written.

And remember, when the time comes for car-changing, Carwow can even help you to sell your old car quickly and efficiently. How much is the Haval Jolion Pro? How much is the Haval Jolion Pro? The Haval Jolion’s price tag is its biggest asset — prices start at less than £24,000, which means that this mid-size SUV looks like a Kia Sportage or Nissan Qashqai rival, but it’s priced closer to the Ford Kuga or Toyota Yaris Cross . Entry-level ‘Premium’ models come with 17-inch alloy wheels, keyless entry, Bluetooth connectivity, smartphone mirroring, adaptive cruise control , the big 10.25-inch touchscreen, a reversing camera, and blind spot monitoring, all as standard.

https://www.carwow.co.uk/gwm/ora-03,GWM Ora 03 Review & Prices,"€35,106",6/10,new,"Is the GWM Ora 03 a good car? Is the GWM Ora 03 a good car? The Ora 03 is the first car to go on sale in the UK from Chinese car firm GWM. It might look like it’s Mini-sized in photos, but it’s actually close to a Volkswagen ID3 in dimensions, so it’s closer to a small SUV than a small city car. If you’re looking at an Ora 03 then cars like the Volvo EX30 , Smart #1 and MG4 may also be on your shopping list. You might know this car as the Ora Funky Cat, but it was renamed at the end of 2023. That's a shame because the odd name felt apt, as the best way to describe this electric car's styling is, well, ‘funky’. It looks like the result of an amorous evening between a Volkswagen Beetle and a Mini , and the result is a handsome family EV which stands out on the road. The funkiness continues with an elaborate headlight and taillight show when you unlock it, and some fish that swim across the screens when you open the door. Cute. Inside it’s similarly smart, with high-quality materials to be found throughout. It feels much more upmarket than the ID3, for example. The twin 10.25-inch displays are bright and crisp, however they can be a fiddle to operate. You do get voice commands as well through, and these work very well. Even the base model comes fully loaded with wireless phone charging, an excellent range of cameras for parking and low speed manoeuvres, LED headlights and much more. More good news is found in the back seats, where even taller adults will have plenty of room. It’s just as posh as the front and the arm rest has a couple of cup holders. On the down side, the Ora 03 is fairly narrow so it can be a bit of a squeeze for three adults. The boot is the Ora 03's weak point. At 228 litres it’s a bit bigger than the Mini Cooper Electric . But this car is the size of an ID3, which has a 385-litre boot. There’s some under-floor storage but you’ll probably have to store your cables in the main compartment, while a big load lip makes it difficult to lift heavy items in and out. Behind the wheel, the Ora 03 is at its best in the city. The steering is light, making it easy to manoeuvre in tight spaces. Acceleration is slow to pick up from a standstill but it’s quick and responsive once on the move. The suspension does an adequate job of soaking up bumps as well, although it can get a bit fidgety over smaller imperfections. On the motorway there is a lot of wind noise, which can be annoying over long distances. It’s not as comfortable at higher speeds either, while most alternatives, such as the MG4, are more fun to drive in the corners. There are two battery options for the Ora 03, the larger of which will do up to 260 miles on a charge. Not bad, but a Volkswagen ID3 can manage up to 357 miles and the cheaper MG 4 SE has 281 miles of range. Overall, the GWM Ora 03 is a decent addition to the UK’s family car market. It provides a high-quality and spacious alternative to more traditional brands and outperforms them in many ways. However, its small boot and disappointing motorway driving do count against it. If you like the look of the GWM Ora 03 and are interested in getting behind the wheel, check out our Ora 03 deals to see how much you could save. Or check out used GWM Ora 03s here . Remember too, that when the time comes to sell your old car you can do that right here through Carwow's network of trusted dealers. How much is the GWM Ora 03? How much is the GWM Ora 03? When you consider how much kit you get as standard, the Ora 03 represents great value for money. It’s a few thousand pounds more expensive than the MG4, but the Ora is better equipped and has a posher cabin. The Volkswagen ID3 is considerably pricier and, despite being more practical, the interior doesn’t look or feel as posh as this newcomer. There are two trim levels to choose from: Pure+ and Pro+. The main difference between these two is the driving range - the Pure+ will do 193 miles on a charge while the Pro+ has 260 miles of range - although the latter does have some extra kit such as massage seats, automatic parking assist and a reversing assistant. It’ll cost you around £3,000 to upgrade to the Pro+, and it’s well worth the money for the added range alone. All cars get a 360-degree camera, twin 10.25-inch screens, adaptive cruise control, keyless entry and wireless phone charging. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort The Ora 03 is easy to drive around town, but the poor refinement gets annoying at higher speeds The Ora 03 is happiest when cruising around town. The steering is nice and light, making nipping in and out of tight spaces a breeze, and there are plenty of cameras around the car to help you out. The suspension does a decent job of soaking up bumps in the road, although it can feel a bit jittery over smaller imperfections. It’s still more comfortable than a Cupra Born , but a Volvo EX30 handles rough surfaces with aplomb. There’s a momentary pause when you put your foot down before the car moves forward, meaning pulling out at junctions requires planning to make sure you don’t get caught out. It’s pretty punchy on the move though, so nipping past the odd cyclist is easy. Speaking of cyclists, the Ora 03 has a raft of safety systems on board to keep an eye out for them and other vulnerable road users. It’ll warn you if there’s a bike in your blind spot when you’re in slow moving traffic, and it even brings up the blind spot camera to show you where they are. There’s a single pedal driving mode, which is great when traffic builds up because it increases regenerative braking and can stop the car without the driver touching the brakes. It would be nice to have a quick access button somewhere, though, rather than having to dig into menus to access it every time you get in the car. The same can be said for the safety tech, because silencing the endless beeps and bongs requires a lot of screen prodding. If manoeuvring isn’t your strong suit, the Pro+ model comes with an automatic parking assistant which can slot you into a tight space with no input from you. It also has a reversing assistant, which can replay your last few yards of driving in reverse to get you out of a tricky spot. You have to be in a very difficult situation to call on this system though, because it is very slow. The Ora 03 is less happy when you venture out onto the motorway. The first thing you’ll notice is the excessive wind noise, which quickly becomes annoying and requires a little more radio volume to drown out than you might expect, given the refinement seen elsewhere. The suspension is less composed, too. It’s not that it’s uncomfortable, it just feels like bumps in the road unsettle the car, meaning it’s always jiggling along and never quite relaxes. There’s a lot of driver assistance technology included as standard, with adaptive cruise control and lane keep assist the key advantages on the motorway, taking some of the stress out of long trips. Again, the Ora 03 isn’t at its best on a winding road. The steering is the issue here because there’s little feedback from the surface so you can’t be confident the front end has grip. The MG4 is much more composed in this regard, and is more fun as a result. The driver assistance technology can be a little intrusive here, too. On tighter British roads, the lane keeping systems will often tug at the wheel because they think you’re too close to the verge. You can turn it off, but you have to do it every time you get back in the car. Space and practicality Space and practicality The cabin is spacious both front and rear, but the boot is disappointingly small and there’s no storage under the bonnet, either The Ora 03’s confusing proportions are most obvious in the cabin. It looks like it should be pretty cramped, but when you jump inside it’s as spacious as a small SUV. It’s easy to get comfortable because the steering wheel adjusts for both height and reach, while the front seats are electrically adjustable. The two front chairs are nice and comfortable as well, with enough support that you don’t get a backache after a long stint behind the wheel, it’s just a shame that there’s no adjustable lumbar support. The range-topping model has heated, ventilated and massaging seats as well. Very fancy. Storage is okay, with a cubby hole beneath the arm rest, a small shelf for your phone that includes the wireless charging pad, and another small spot beneath the dashboard. The cupholders are here too, and while they’re deep and grippy they sit low behind the gear selector making them tricky to get to while on the move. The glovebox has one of the smoothest actions on any car, gently lowering when you press the open button. However, it’s quite slow, so could prove annoying if you want to quickly grab something from inside. Space in the rear is similarly impressive. Even taller passengers will find plenty of head, leg and knee room, though it’s a bit of a squeeze with three across the back and there’s not much support for your thighs. There’s a fold-down armrest between the two outer seats, which has a couple of cupholders inside, or you can fit large bottles in the door bins if required. There are pockets in the back of the seats, too, with the only disappointment that there’s only a single USB slot for rear passengers. Fitting a child seat is a pain-free affair as well thanks to the wide-opening back doors, although you do have to stab around between the seat back and base to find the ISOFIX anchor points. That impressive cabin space does come at the expense of boot space, unfortunately. At just 228 litres it’s not much bigger than the Mini Electric, and quite a bit smaller than the 267 litres found in the Vauxhall Corsa Electric , which is a much smaller car. Compared with the ID3, it’s well down on the Volkswagen’s 385 litres. What’s more, there’s nowhere to store the parcel shelf under the floor, and only a small section to put a three-pin plug charger, so you’ll need to put the bulky Type 2 cables in a bag in the boot, eating up more room. There’s also a large load lip, which makes it tricky to load large, heavy items in and out. There aren’t many clever features in the boot either, with no tie-down points or 12V sockets in sight. The seats fold down 60:40 to open it up to 858-litres of space, but there’s a big ridge in the floor which makes it hard to slide bulky items to the front. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories The interior look and quality is a strong point for the Ora 03, but the infotainment system is a faff to use Jump inside the Ora 03 and it’s tough to find anything to fault in terms of quality. There are soft and squidgy materials throughout that give a proper premium appeal. There are scratchy plastics to be found but you have to go looking for them. There are three colour combinations to choose from, with dark grey upholstery coming as standard. Pay a little extra and you can have either a red and cream or green and cream cabin to match the exterior paint job. Strangely though, this is only available on the entry-level Pure+ model. The Pro+ gets a black interior and that’s it. Boo. You get two 10.25-inch displays as standard, and they look great. The graphics are sharp and they’re pretty bright. You get some virtual fish swimming across the dashboard when you get in as well. Unfortunately looks can be deceiving, and the central infotainment screen can be very frustrating to use, with tiny icons and laggy response times making it a faff to navigate, especially on the move. This is especially bad when almost all of the car’s functions are controlled through that screen. Adjusting the climate control, turning on the heated seats or turning off the driver assistance systems all require too much thought when you’re driving, especially if you’re using Android Auto or Apple CarPlay because you have to exit the smartphone mirroring to access these menus. The 03 does have one saving grace on the infotainment front though, and that’s the voice commands. One press of a button on the steering wheel and you can tell the car what you’d like to do, and it’s pretty good at recognising your phrases. You can just tell it to set a temperature, but it’s annoying that it brings up the climate menu when it makes the change and you have to prod your way back out of it to go back to your multimedia. The other screen sits in front of the driver, and it displays all the information you need in a clear and concise way. It’s also more customisable than the digital driver’s display you get in a VW ID3, and the Volvo EX30 doesn’t have one at all. Electric range, charging and tax Electric range, charging and tax There are two battery options for the Ora 03, starting with the 48 Kwh pack in the Pure+ model. This version has an official 193 miles of range, which is better than smaller cars like the Mini Cooper Electric, but an MG4 can do 270 miles in its most basic form. If you want a more useful driving range, the Pro+ has a larger 63kWh battery with 260 miles of range. That’s slightly more competitive, but it’s still down on the MG4 and a Volkswagen ID3 can manage almost 100 miles more. A week with the Pro+ model in mixed driving conditions saw a real-world range of around 230 miles. The 03’s charging speed leaves a bit to be desired as well, because the Pure+ car can only charge at 64kW at a DC fast charger. This means it takes over 40 minutes to charge from 15-80%, while a Volkswagen ID3 can charge from 5-80% in just half an hour. Go for the larger battery in the Pro+ and you can charge at 100kW, but it still takes 48 minutes to charge from 15-80%. Electric vehicles are particularly appealing for company car buyers because they have a benefit-in-kind tax rate of just 2% until 2025, making them considerably cheaper in tax than even a small, economical petrol-powered hatchback. You’ll also be exempt from vehicle excise duty until 2025. Safety and security Safety and security Safety-conscious buyers will likely be drawn to the Ora 03’s vast suite of driver assistance systems. Not only did it get full marks in Euro NCAP safety testing , its huge score was beaten only by more expensive, ultra safe cars from the likes of Tesla and Lexus. Equipment includes adaptive cruise control that will stop and start in traffic, lane keep assist, lane centring, auto emergency braking and much more. There’s also a facial recognition system that has a variety of functions. For one, it will keep an eye on the driver and display a warning if they look drowsy or are not paying attention, for example if using their phone. It can also recognise different drivers and load appropriate settings, such as their work destination in the sat nav. As useful as these systems sound, they can get intrusive and annoying in practice. The car is constantly beeping and bonging, especially in heavy town traffic where the front collision warning is overly sensitive. It doesn’t help that a lot of the warnings in the car are verbal and quite loud, which grates after a while. While you can turn these systems off, it’s a faff through the screen and they all default to on every time you get in the car. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems With this being the first electric car GWM has sold in the UK, it’s unclear whether you should expect solid reliability. However, electric vehicles tend to be more reliable than combustion-engined cars. GWM has also been building cars for the Chinese market for several years now, which should be reassuring. The standard Ora 03 warranty is five years with unlimited mileage, while the battery has an eight-year/100,000-mile warranty."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/jaecoo/7,Jaecoo 7 Review & Prices,"€38,189",6/10,new,"Is the Jaecoo 7 a good car? Is the Jaecoo 7 a good car? Jaecoo is one of a number of new Chinese brands popping up in the UK at the moment, and the Jaecoo 7 is the first of its offerings to reach British shores. It comes well equipped, with a better fit and finish than you might expect from an upstart manufacturer, but it’s not the most refined SUV on the market. It’s almost like a child that’s discovered a natural talent for the first time. There are flashes of brilliance here and there, but there’s still some work to be done in honing it all. Think of the Jaecoo 7 as a new alternative to the tried-and-true Volkswagen Tiguan and Kia Sportage . Though Jaecoo does have more of a leg to stand on than a lot of start-up car companies, because it’s actually owned by Chery - a Chinese car manufacturing giant. It also owns Omoda , and Jaecoo already has over 70 established dealerships in the UK, with a goal of 130 by the end of 2025. Speaking of established, you might recognise some design cues from existing manufacturers in the Jaeecoo 7’s design. There’s more than a whiff of Range Rover in its side profile, while the bold front grille’s chrome, vertical strakes resemble a Bentley if you squint. That doesn’t change the fact that it’s a handsome car, but it is slightly derivative. You’ll find more of the same inside the Jaecoo 7, with a good looking, fairly minimalist interior that features one-or-two Range Rover and Mercedes -esque design touches in the steering wheel badge and centre console. Entry level Deluxe cars feature a 13.2-inch portrait infotainment touchscreen, upgrading to a 14.8-inch unit in Luxury models, while both feature a digital driver display. Material quality is high, with lots of soft-touch trims and sturdy feeling surfaces all around you. The low-down plastics are a bit scratchy, but that’s as per the norm in mid-sized SUVs at the moment. There’s a fair amount of storage all round, and the seats are generally comfortable. There’s loads of space too, with plenty of headroom, legroom and space for your feet under the front seats. The boot is a little shallow, and while it has a useful 500-litre capacity, it’s not deep enough for loading bulky items into. On the road the Jaecoo 7 starts to reveal why it’s cheaper than its established alternatives. It’s easy to drive around town, with good manoeuvrability on tight roads and plenty of forward visibility to place the car, but the suspension does thud over bumps in the road and it’s not confidence inspiring on country lanes. You get a choice of two engines in the Jaecoo 7, a 1.6-litre petrol unit and a 1.5-litre plug-in hybrid (PHEV). Neither are particularly fast, but the PHEV has more pep in its step and a claimed 54-mile electric range. It’s much cheaper to tax, too. As a well-equipped, handsome family car the Jaecoo 7 offers good value for money, and you can check out new Jaecoo 7 deals here on Carwow, as well as Jaecoo 7 lease deals . There are also used Jaecoo 7s available through our network of trusted dealers, and you can even sell your current car through Carwow when the time comes to change. How much is the Jaecoo 7? How much is the Jaecoo 7? The petrol Jaecoo 7 starts at a hair over £30,000, which is phenomenal value considering you get heated seats, a crisp 13.2-inch touchscreen display, LED headlights, heated seats, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity and a panoramic roof as standard on the entry-level Deluxe car. That’s over £5,000 less than the more sparsely-equipped base model Volkswagen Tiguan, and around the same price as the entry-level Nissan Qashqai and Kia Sportage. Neither are as well equipped as the Jaecoo 7 either, though. The Luxury model is only available as a plug-in hybrid and costs around £5,000 more than the Deluxe model, but you do get heated rear seats, ventilated front seats, a heated steering wheel, posh Sony sound system and the larger 14.8-inch display as standard. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort Light steering and good visibility make it easy to thread around town, but the Jaecoo 7 loses its shine at higher speeds The Jaecoo 7 looks big in photos, but in reality it’s well sized for city driving while still being spacious inside. It’s a little bit shorter than the Hyundai Tucson , making it fairly easy to find a parking space, but while the high seating position gives you a good view of the road ahead, rear visibility is disappointing. Still, the big door mirrors at least take some of the stress out of parking, as does the tight turning circle and light steering. The brakes manage to avoid feeling grabby at low speeds in the hybrid models too, as befalls so many hybrid cars these days, doing a good job of masking the transition between regenerative braking and the physical brakes kicking in. It’s not that comfortable over bumps and potholes though, with an audible crash resonating through the cockpit when you’re driving over a bad road. The Jaecoo 7’s driving experience is more disappointing at higher speeds, as road noise builds up noticeably the faster you go and the crashy suspension is exaggerated when you’re at a cruise. Joining motorways is easy, but the petrol version sounds slightly strained under hard acceleration. Jaecoo’s active lane assist could do with some relaxation tips too, as it is too oversensitive when you’re even slightly to one side of your lane - and it jerks you back towards the centre rather violently. The rest of the safety assistance systems are just as intrusive - particularly the driver attention warning setup - as they bong away merrily when you’re not expecting them to. You can’t turn them off without the car thinking you’re not paying attention to the road either, so you really have to strain to use your peripheral vision and focus on your hand inputs. Ironic, and annoying. Even by the standards of other family SUVs, the Jaecoo 7 still feels slightly out of its depths on a twisty road. The light steering that does well in town provides little idea of what the front wheels are doing on a winding road, or how much grip they have. The lane-keep assist jerk is particularly noticeable here, but it’s the jiggliness over bumpier high-speed corners that unsettles both you and the Jaecoo the most. Country lanes are best taken at a moderate pace. Space and practicality Space and practicality There’s a spacious cabin in the Jaecoo, but the boot is awkwardly shaped It’s easy to get comfortable in the Jaecoo 7, with plenty of room in the front and lots of movement in the standard-fit electrically adjustable seats. An odd touch, but the dashboard layout changes depending on which engine you opt for in your car. The plug-in hybrid (PHEV) model moves the great selector up from the centre console to the steering column, allowing for extra cubby space between the seats. Speaking of which, there are a pair of (slightly too large to be useful) cup holders in the centre console, as well as a button-operated hidden cubby and an open storage space in the middle by your feet. Large door pockets and a large glove box are handy, with easily enough space for a one-litre water bottle, as is the cooled phone storage tray which doubles up as a charger. The hidden central cubby is cooled too, should you wish. You get plenty of headroom in the back thanks to the Jaecoo 7’s boxy shape and tall roofline, and there’s a good amount of space for most people’s knees. Tall occupants might find kneeroom a little tight, but under-seat foot space is acceptable. There’s a pair of cupholders in the rear armrest but again, they don’t do a great job of holding a bottle securely, though there are useful pockets on the front seat backs for storing both phones and larger items in separate spaces. They do feel a little flimsy though. Three adults can fit in the back in relative comfort thanks to the flat floor and relatively flat bench, but you’ll want to keep five-up trips short. Luxury-spec cars get heated rear seats, but there’s not much more in the way of creature comforts back there. The Jaecoo’s 500 litres of boot space isn’t particularly generous, lagging behind the Volkswagen Tiguan (615 litres), Kia Sportage (591 litres), and Nissan Qashqai (504 litres). It’s usefully square and equipped with bag hooks and a 12-volt connection, but if you regularly carry bulky items then the Jaecoo could be an inconvenience. The depth of the boot is lacking compared to its alternatives, and while there’s under-floor storage space for stowing cables and other odds-and-sods out of sight, you can’t lower the boot floor for a larger overall volume. There’s also nowhere to put the parcel shelf if you do need to remove it. Drop the rear seats down and the space becomes much more useful, as the seats almost fold flat and expand the boot’s volume to 1,265 litres. There’s an odd nifty feature too, where you can hook the parcel shelf to the boot floor and the open bootlid to create a projector screen. Why? Well, why not? Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories There’s plenty of standard kit, but the Jaecoo 7 isn’t without its quirks At first glance the Jaecoo 7 makes a good impression, looking easily posh enough for its price point, and it stays impressive once you’re sat in the car. The steering wheel badge resembles a Range Rover and the hidden box in the centre console is giving Mercedes, and the material quality isn’t all that far off posher brands. The dashboard, armrests and door tops are all trimmed in soft leatherette and pleasant plastics, and it’s only lower down that you begin to feel the scratchier, harder trims. That’s not unique to the Jaecoo though, and it’s something you’ll even find in luxurious alternatives from Audi and BMW . Standard kit is pretty great too, with a panoramic roof on both trim levels and a head-up display, ventilated front seats and heated steering wheel as standard on the higher spec Luxury car. Entry level Deluxe cars feature a 13.2-inch infotainment screen as standard, where the top trim level gets a 14.8-inch unit instead, but they’re identical to operate. Infotainment is crucial to the Jaecoo’s cabin, as the central display controls everything from music to the climate control system. It’s hit and miss though, because while the touchscreen has clear graphics and feels responsive to the touch, it’s still fiddly to change settings on the fly. What’s more, the complete lack of a volume knob means that passengers can’t turn the music up or down. While in theory that shouldn’t matter, it’s annoying having to rely on the steering wheel control alone. The main annoyance comes when you’re on the move, because the Jaecoo 7 is fitted with a rather sensitive driver awareness sensor. If you adjust the settings, look in your mirrors or just turn to face your passenger for a brief moment the car thinks you’re no longer focused on your driving. It’s very annoying. MPG, emissions and tax MPG, emissions and tax There are two engines to choose from on the Jaecoo 7, a 1.6-litre four-cylinder petrol engine with a seven-speed automatic gearbox and a 1.5-litre plug-in hybrid engine that comes equipped with a CVT gearbox instead. The petrol-powered model can be had in front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive, where the hybrid is exclusively front-driven. The petrol model isn’t all that efficient, especially in all-wheel drive trim where it only offers a claimed 35mpg. Front-wheel drive cars are slightly better at 38mpg and emit 169g/km of CO2, where the all-wheel drive version outputs 183g/km. Both the front-wheel drive petrol Jaecoo 7 and the four-wheel drive car fall into fairly high first-year tax bands , dropping down to the flat rate for year two onwards. All models escape the luxury car tax, fortunately. The hybrid model is much cheaper to tax, with CO2 emissions of just 23g/km. Company car drivers will be happy to know that the hybrid Jaecoo 7 sits in one of the lowest Benefit in Kind tax rates, thanks to its CO2 emissions output of 23g/km and claimed 53 miles of electric range. Safety and security Safety and security The Jaecoo 7 scored an excellent five-star safety rating when tested by Euro NCAP in 2025, scoring above 80% in all four testing categories: adult occupant, child occupant, vulnerable road users and safety assistance tech. It comes fitted as standard with a suite of driver assistance technology, including an attention and drowsiness detector, 360-degree parking cameras, automatic emergency braking and a lane assist system. You get a pair of ISOFIX child seat anchor points in the back, and while it’s a shame that there isn’t one in the front passenger seat, they do have handy flip-open covers which make attaching the seat a piece of cake. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems Jaecoo is too new to have had any real-world feedback when it comes to reliability. In fact it’s so new that it didn’t place on the 2024 Driver Power reliability survey , nor did its sister company Omoda. You do, however, get a hugely competitive seven-year/100,000-mile warranty with the Jaecoo 7. Compared to the European alternatives at three years/60,000 miles, that’s some good going. Jaecoo also offers an eight year warranty on the PHEV mode’s hybrid system. Only Toyota and Lexus offer better, with a ten year warranty if you keep up regular servicing at a main dealership."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/leapmotor/c10,Leapmotor C10 Review & Prices,"€42,705",Not found,new,"Is the Leapmotor C10 a good car? Is the Leapmotor C10 a good car? Leapmotor is a new brand in the UK, Chinese in origin but with the backing of the huge Stellantis Group of companies - the force behind Citroen, Peugeot, Fiat and Jeep among others. The C10 is the larger of its two launch models, sitting above the T03 city car - it’s a fully electric SUV aimed at people who might otherwise consider the likes of the Renault Scenic E-Tech , BYD Atto 3 or Tesla Model Y . Despite having a face that looks a bit like Marvin the Paranoid Android, the C10 doesn’t claim to have a brain the size of a planet - in fact, unlike the quite clever T03, it doesn’t really do anything special. Instead it’s hoping to appeal to you with a combination of good value, understated looks, and impressive interior space. The C10 certainly won’t stand out in a crowd, unlike some alternatives which seem made to be as eye-catching as possible. It’s quite minimal, with the front getting a flat-topped bar containing both headlights - mirrored in a lightbar at the rear. The sides are flat and featureless with pop-out doorhandles, and the alloy wheels have a simple design. The same is true of the interior, which has just as few physical switches as a Tesla Model Y. Leapmotor seems to have made everything out of the same colour plastic where possible, giving it a quite cohesive - if very monochrome - look. The centre console features two cupholders and a wireless charging pad beneath a huge 14.6-inch touchscreen, while there’s a further 10.3-inch screen for the driver information. Everything is controlled either through one of these screens or through the steering wheel controls, though there is an AI-powered voice assistant too. Passenger space in the Leapmotor C10 appears pretty generous with a wide, flat rear seat. ISOFIX points in both outer rear seats, wide-opening doors and big windows all point to this being quite a good car for those who need to fit child seats in the rear. There’s also a 435-litre boot, which is less impressive - it’s soundly beaten by the 545-litre Renault Scenic E-Tech and smashed into submission by the Tesla Model Y and its vast 854-litre space. It’s more on par with the BYD Atto 3, which gets 440 litres of room. There’s just one electric motor and battery combination available in the Leapmotor C10. It’s a 218hp motor, driving the rear wheels, and offering up to 262 miles of range in official tests. Those figures aren’t really that impressive - in fact, they’re almost identical to the BYD Atto 3, though that uses a smaller battery. The Scenic E-Tech gets 260 miles from its small-battery option, but also has a long-range model offering up to 379 miles, while the Tesla Model Y can go up to 311 miles.

How much is the Leapmotor C10? The C10 comes in a single, well-equipped trim level, costing just below £37,000. That makes it a smidge cheaper than a BYD Atto 3 or Renault Scenic E-Tech, and quite a bit cheaper than a Tesla Model Y, so value is clearly Leapmotor’s intention. Electrically-adjustable seats, dual-zone climate control, a panoramic sunroof, LED headlights, a 360-degree camera system and 12-speaker audio setup all read like they’re from the equipment list of a much pricier car. However, it’s often the implementation of posh features that lets down new EV brands, so we’ll hold off on whether all these extras are worth having when we get behind the wheel of the Leapmotor C10."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/leapmotor/t03,Leapmotor T03 Review & Prices,"€18,714",6/10,new,"Is the Leapmotor T03 a good car? Is the Leapmotor T03 a good car? While tiny, cheap electric cars have really caught on in some markets, they haven’t so much in the UK - and most popular electric cars sold here are larger and relatively posh. But Leapmotor thinks the bottom of the market is worth a try - so it’s having a go with this, the tiny Leapmotor T03. If you’ve never heard of Leapmotor, don’t worry. It’s a new brand to the UK, and is Chinese in origin - but its European operations are half-owned by the giant Stellantis manufacturing group that also operates Citroen , Peugeot , Fiat and many others, so Leapmotor has a ready-made network of dealers and service centres. It’s like buying a TV from a supermarket - you might not have heard of the brand before, but you can at least be confident there’s a warranty behind it and somewhere to return it to if things go wrong. With the T03’s dinky dimensions and low price tag, there’s only really one car it’s taking aim at - the Dacia Spring . Leapmotor’s offering is a bit more expensive than a basic Spring, but has more range and greater equipment levels to make up for it. The T03 could also be a credible alternative to a used version of a larger EV - it’s pretty comparable to a one-year-old Vauxhall Corsa Electric or MG4 EV . Range: 165 miles Efficiency: 4.4 mi/kWh Battery size: 37.3kWh Max charge speed: 48kW Charge time AC: 6hrs 0-100% (6.6kW) Charge time DC: 36 mins 30-80% (48kW) Charge port location: Front centre Power outputs: 95hp The T03’s styling stands out from more aggressive-looking alternatives. It looks like an anime character with headlights that look like friendly eyes and a small, smiley grille. Its body is tall and narrow, like a Japanese kei car, and sits on tiny 13-inch wheels. It feels a bit like an electric Fiat Panda, reimagined for 2025. That tall body has an advantage when it comes to passenger room - the T03 has an impressive amount of space, and four six-foot adults can get surprisingly comfortable inside. It’s far too narrow to accommodate three across the rear bench, though, and even two burly adults might find the front seats to be a bit snug. Plus, all that room for people means the boot is a dinky 210 litres in capacity - smaller than the Dacia Spring’s. The T03’s simple dashboard design feels much more like a ‘proper’ car than the Dacia’s, and all models get a crisp and clear 10.1-inch central touchscreen and an 8.0-inch driver’s instrument display. Those two come at the expense of almost all physical controls, even a volume dial - and annoyingly, the infotainment software isn’t clever or responsive enough to make you forget or forgive this. Plus, you don’t get Apple CarPlay or Android Auto , which is very frustrating. Interior quality is very good for the price tag otherwise, making the lack of software finesse even more irritating. To drive, the T03 feels nippy around town - with 95hp, it’s much more powerful than the Dacia Spring or equivalent petrol-fuelled city cars, and that reflects in a feeling of urgency when you put your foot down. It’s not totally outclassed on the motorway either, though the tall body and tiny, narrow tyres soon kibosh any thoughts of enjoying yourself on a twisty back road. With a small 37.3kWh battery pack, range is an official 165 miles - though that’s reduced greatly if you do lots of motorway driving. Charge speeds are modest, too, and reflect that this is likely to be a second car charged up at home rather than a main vehicle undertaking lots of long journeys.

Remember that Carwow can even help you to sell your old car when the time comes. How much does the Leapmotor T03 cost? How much does the Leapmotor T03 cost? At less than £16,000, the Leapmotor T03 is the second-cheapest electric car on sale in the UK. It’s undercut by the Dacia Spring – not by very much, but every little penny does count. At this price it’s an alternative to something like a year-old Vauxhall Corsa Electric or MG4 EV. There’s only one trim level, but it does come very well equipped for a budget car. You get those two big screens, a panoramic sunroof, two-tone paint, a reversing camera, air-con, keyless start and plenty of driver assistance tech. It’s likely that once the brand is more established in Europe Leapmotor will launch a more basic, lighter-weight T03. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort Good performance for a budget car, but don’t expect much in the way of handling with such tiny tyres The Leapmotor T03 is purpose-built to be a great city car, and it has plenty going for it. The tall body and big windows give a great view out - admittedly less so when it’s raining, as you only have a single wiper at the front and no rear wiper. The 95hp motor is much peppier than the one in the Dacia Spring or the petrol engines you get in traditional city cars, and gives great performance away from traffic lights or during other low-speed operations. Combined with light, accurate steering and pretty soft suspension that does a good job of dealing with inner-city lumps and bumps, the T03 is a great car to drive around town. There are only two real annoyances. The first is the low-speed pedestrian warning sound - it’s far too loud, and becomes really annoying on the inside especially as it goes up in steps rather than smoothly and consistently. The second is the driver assistance tech, but more on that later… You might expect the Leapmotor T03 to be out of its depth on the motorway, but it holds up at least as well as any other city car. Compared to something like a Toyota Aygo X or Hyundai i10 , the T03 is actually pretty quick at getting up to speed, and once it’s there it feels stable and refined, without a screaming petrol engine to break the hush. There’s more wind noise than you get from a more expensive, better-insulated alternative, and the tall, lightweight body gets thrown about by crosswinds or by overtaking traffic. But it doesn’t feel too intimidating to drive. It’s only really the lack of range that would prevent you from regularly undertaking long motorway trips in this car. With its tall silhouette and tiny, skinny tyres, you shouldn’t expect great things from the Leapmotor T03 on a twisty road. At low speeds it’s fine, but it feels a bit precarious when you’re going faster. The body leans a lot in the corners, the light steering doesn’t give much feedback, and there isn’t much grip from the skinny tyres which means the stability systems tend to cut in quite early. The same is true for most city cars, however - if you want a cheap car that’s fun to drive, you should look into something like an MG3 . Space and practicality Space and practicality Loads of space for passengers, but boot space and storage is lacking The Leapmotor T03 is a pretty narrow car, so it’s not best suited to rugby players - even in the front seats, two big occupants will find their shoulders rubbing together. There’s also no centre console to speak of, just a narrow strip holding the electronic parking brake. However, the seats give loads of legroom and headroom, and there’s enough adjustment in the driving position for motorists of all sizes, although the wheel doesn’t adjust for reach - only rake. Storage is a little less good - the door bins and glovebox are quite small, and there’s just a single cupholder in the centre with a slot for a smartphone ahead of it. There’s nowhere obvious to sling keys or wallets, though the lack of a centre console does mean it’s really easy to slide across and get out of either side - which can be useful if you’re in a city or a particularly tricky parking spot. Rear legroom and headroom put the Dacia Spring, Fiat 500 Electric and even larger cars like the Vauxhall Corsa Electric to shame. There’s space for a six-foot adult to get comfortable, even behind a driver of a similar size. It’s too narrow to accommodate three across the back, but don’t worry - you don’t get the choice to, with only two seatbelts. Annoyingly, though, you only get one ISOFIX point for mounting a child seat - it would have been much more useful with two. At least the rear doors are large and open wide enough to make loading children easy, and the windows open properly. The T03’s boot is a paltry 210 litres in capacity. That’s much smaller than the 308 litres you get in a Dacia Spring - it’s the same size as the three-door Mini Electric , and only a little bigger than the Fiat 500e’s space. It’s a deep space with a very narrow aperture, so loading items isn’t as easy as it could be, and while the rear seats do fold they do so in one go - so you can’t balance extra loading space with a third passenger like you can in alternatives. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories Stylish and well-equipped for such a cheap car, but desperately frustrating to use The Leapmotor T03’s interior doesn’t immediately give off budget car vibes. The two screens - a central 10.1-inch display for infotainment and a large 8.0-inch instrument panel - are clear, bright and high-res, and the minimalist design is well up-to-date. Compared with Dacia’s more outwardly basic approach in the Spring, it’s quite appealing. So too are the materials chosen, with plenty of fabric trim giving it a more upmarket vibe. The bits not covered in fabric are covered in hard plastic - but it feels quite dense, rather than being super-cheap and scratchy. Build quality seems good. The central screen reacts quite quickly to your presses, but the software just isn’t good enough. The menus are confusing, and it’s not immediately obvious where you go to find different functions. Many of them use icons that are far too small and difficult to hit on the move. There’s no Apple CarPlay or Android Auto connectivity either, which means you have to use the (really rather poor) built-in sat-nav and old-fashioned Bluetooth for music. Leapmotor’s own voice control is pretty poor, and you only get USB-A sockets for charging devices rather than the now-standard USB-C. The most annoying thing is the lack of physical controls. There isn’t even a volume knob - the only way to change how loud your music is, is with the buttons on the steering wheel. The climate controls are screen-based too, and instead of setting a temperature you have to choose between heating or cooling and then decide on its intensity, which is needlessly complex. Some of these are the sorts of things we hope might be fixed in a software update in future. Electric range, charging and tax Electric range, charging and tax Leapmotor claims the T03 can return up to 165 miles on the official WLTP cycle. That’s a little better than the 140 miles a Dacia Spring can do, but comes from a much larger 37.3kWh battery - the Spring’s battery is just 26.8kWh, showing greater efficiency. During a week of mostly town driving, we saw around 130 miles of indicated range, which would relegate the T03 to second-car duties for most people. Though it’s capable of that distance, you’d probably want to avoid charging up when out and about as it only has a relatively slow charging speed - for the benchmark 10-80% top-up you’ll be looking at over 45 minutes at a charger. You’d certainly get greater utility with a used example of a larger car, such as a Vauxhall Corsa Electric which has a WLTP range of 200+ miles and can charge from 10-80% in around half an hour. With its super-low purchase price, electric powertrain (and therefore zero emissions) the Leapmotor T03 does of course qualify for the lowest rate of road tax and company car benefit-in-kind tax. Safety and security Safety and security The Leapmotor T03 hasn’t been tested by Euro NCAP just yet. All models do get six airbags and the usual array of active safety kit, but given it’s such a small, lightweight car you probably shouldn’t expect it to put in a top-notch performance. All it really has to beat is the Dacia Spring’s one-star rating, though. The T03’s driver assistance tech is frustrating, to say the least. Items like the lane-keeping and driver monitoring systems are far too twitchy, the latter moaning at you for a good 15 seconds if you so much as dare to yawn. You’ll definitely want to turn them off as quickly as possible, but this requires diving into several separate menus and can only be done while the car is stationary, which is very frustrating. We’d prefer to see a quick shortcut to do this. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems Leapmotor is a brand-new company in the UK and the T03 is a brand-new model, so there’s no reliability data on it just yet. It has been sold in China since 2021, though, so you can expect any major defects would have been ironed out in that time. The T03’s warranty is four years or 60,000 miles, giving it an extra year of cover over most European alternatives - but the Dacia Spring has up to six years or 75,000 miles of cover if serviced appropriately, and the MG 4 has seven years and 80,000 miles of warranty. At least Leapmotor’s partnership with Stellantis means that there’ll be an ample dealer network, and parts supply should be easy. Leapmotor T03 FAQs Leapmotor T03 FAQs"
https://www.carwow.co.uk/xpeng/g6,Xpeng G6 Review & Prices,"€49,725",8/10,new,"Is the Xpeng G6 a good car? Is the Xpeng G6 a good car? The Xpeng G6 is the latest Chinese electric car vying for your attention, and it’s well worthy of it. Xpeng was only founded in 2014 and the G6 launched in China in 2023 - but it’s now made its way to the UK as a mid-sized alternative to the Tesla Model Y , the Hyundai Ioniq 5 , and the Skoda Enyaq . With its smooth silhouette, button-free interior design and oodles of clever tech, it’s definitely the Tesla that Xpeng is most obviously gunning for. If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, then Elon Musk should be tickled pink by the G6’s existence. But don’t go thinking the G6 is just a copycat clone - in fact, it’s a surprisingly mature and well-sorted electric car. Chinese cars often offer great value but are rough around the edges, but that’s not the case with the Xpeng. Range: 270-354 miles Efficiency: 4.0 miles per kWh Battery size: 66kWh/87.5kWh Max charge speed: 215kW/280kW Charge time AC: 7.5-9.5hrs (11kW) Charge time DC: 20mins 10-80% Charge port location: Right rear Power outputs: 255-282bhp In terms of styling, there’s nothing to get too excited about - but nor is there any reason to have a moan. The G6 has smooth sides with flush door handles, a wide lightbar on the front above low-set headlights, and a flat, fairly featureless rear. The alloy wheels look smart and one nice touch is a rear windscreen wiper - something many electric cars of this shape don’t offer. Inside, it’s similarly minimalist. Physical switchgear is limited to the steering wheel, the window switches and the Mercedes -aping column stalks - that’s it. The remainder of your interaction goes through the massive 15.0-inch central touchscreen - though unlike the Tesla Model Y, you also get a driver display with your speed and other essentials on it. In contrast to many Chinese car infotainment systems, the Xpeng’s feels as slick as any Western manufacturer’s. The menus are quick to respond, sensibly laid out and easy to navigate - and that’s no mean feat given the level of gadgetry fitted. Interior quality is pretty good, and it’s roomy too - there’s loads of space in the back, even for three occupants, and the boot is a decent size even if it’s not up to the cavernous area you get in the Tesla Model Y. The rear seats can recline, and the whole affair can even fold flat for in-car camping with an optional mattress accessory. There are special camping modes for the infotainment and air-con to facilitate this. Xpeng hasn’t made the G6 stupidly powerful, nor does it baffle with too much choice. There are two versions - the Standard Range car gets 255hp and can do 270 miles to a charge, while the Long Range has 282hp and is capable of 354 miles between topups. Both are quick without being rabid, but you’re not too encouraged to drive the G6 fast because it’s not especially fun. The steering feels quite disconnected from the front wheels, with very little feedback, and the suspension never really settles into a rhythm. It’s not the harshest-riding car out there, but a Hyundai Ioniq 5 deals better with bumps. However, the Xpeng G6’s strong combination of space, value and range makes it a seriously compelling alternative to the established EV roster. If you’re interested, you can check out our best Xpeng G6 deals , or see other brilliant deals on electric cars . Remember that Carwow can even help you to sell your old car when the time comes. How much is the Xpeng G6? How much is the Xpeng G6? The Xpeng G6 starts off at just under £40,000, an extremely competitive price tag that puts it on a par with the entry-level Hyundai Ioniq 5 and around £5,000 cheaper than a basic Tesla Model Y. It also means it skirts the expensive car supplement on years two to six of ownership. The only model that dips under this threshold is the Standard Range model in its free paint colour of appliance white, though - if you want the Long Range battery or a different colour, the G6 costs more than £40,000. The Long Range version comes in at just under £45,000, which again looks excellent value against Tesla or Hyundai. Performance and drive comfort Performance and drive comfort Performs well enough, but the Xpeng G6 isn’t very comfortable over bumps or much fun in the corners Visibility is a mixed bag in the Xpeng G6 - the front pillars are quite thick and the rear window is tiny, but a glut of cameras surrounding the vehicle (including handy blindspot ones which display when you indicate) make it pretty easy to place the car, especially when parking. There’s also a fantastically good auto-park system, and sensors which display your distance to surrounding objects in inches. Performance around town is strong, and as with all EVs you get an instant, seamless power delivery. However, the G6’s suspension doesn’t absorb bumps very well - it’s quite bouncy over potholes and speed humps, and small road imperfections do rattle through to the cabin. The square steering wheel is also unnecessarily frustrating when you’re doing quick manoeuvres - it’s too thick to grab comfortably, and the centre is too wide. What was wrong with circular steering wheels? Power delivery in the G6 is more moderate than it is in a Tesla, or something like a top-spec Hyundai Ioniq 5 - there’s still plenty of shove, but you won’t be pushed back into your seat even if you put your foot down. As a result, while motorways are a relaxed affair, you can’t quite muscle your way into tight gaps like you can in some alternatives. The G6’s suspension settles down a bit on a faster road though you will still feel potholes, expansion joints and rumble strips more than you would in a Hyundai Ioniq 5. Xpeng’s assisted driving tech is also very good - it’s not quite as sophisticated as Tesla’s Autopilot software, but it combines adaptive cruise control , lane-keeping aids and automatic lane changing when you signal - all in a very smooth and controlled way. There’s no engine noise, of course, and the G6’s smooth shape minimises wind noise, leaving just a hint of wind noise to contend with. It’s a very refined affair. The G6 does have a Sport mode, but it takes a few taps on the infotainment system to access it - and the difference in how it drives is minimal. There’s a choice of three steering weights, but the Sport mode is far too heavy and even the normal setting is quite weighty - it feels most natural in the lightest of the three. However, no matter how you set up the G6, it’s not exactly exciting to drive. It feels quite heavy in the corners (and it is) and doesn’t change direction with much nimbleness. The steering doesn’t really give you a sense of what the front wheels are doing, and though it’s rear-wheel drive there’s no sense of playfulness if you boot it mid-corner. It’s safe, secure and neutral, but not as entertaining as a Hyundai Ioniq 5 or even an MG S5 EV . Space and practicality Space and practicality Boot space lags behind Tesla and there’s no frunk, but rear seat space is excellent The G6 is quite a large car, and the front seats have plenty of room for drivers of all sizes. Electric adjustment is standard, while the steering wheel moves (manually) for reach and rake. Annoyingly, the mirrors need to be positioned through the screen, though there’s a fairly quick shortcut to change them through a pull-down bar at the top. Storage in the front is mixed. There are a pair of cupholders which are quite small, but they’ll fit most takeaway cups. Under-armrest storage and big door bins, plus a large spot underneath the centre console all accommodate larger items, but they don’t quite make up for the G6 lacking a glovebox. There are twin wireless phone chargers on the dash, which are powerful 50W ones. However, despite being ventilated, they leave your phone right in the sun, so you’re very likely to find it getting uncomfortably hot. Rear seat space in the Xpeng G6 is ample. There’s loads of legroom and enough headroom for people over six foot to get comfortable. The floor is totally flat and even the middle seat is quite wide and soft, so carrying three occupants isn’t out of the question. The rear seats also recline by quite a few degrees, for a more relaxing atmosphere. There are twin USB-C ports and air vents in the centre, while the fold-down centre armrest has a pair of hidden cupholders. The door bins back here are a good size too. There are ISOFIX points on both outer rear seats, and the doors open wide enough to make installing a youngun a doddle. The G6 has a 571-litre boot. That’s a really good size, larger than the 520-litre Hyundai Ioniq 5 and close to the 585-litre Skoda Enyaq. It can’t compete with the mammoth 854-litre Tesla Model Y, though. Xpeng also doesn’t give you a front storage area, or ‘frunk’ - though it does look as if there would be space for one. You do get a pair of underfloor compartments which work well for keeping your cables tidy, and the boot lid is powered. The rear seats fold easily and lie totally flat. Interior style, infotainment and accessories Interior style, infotainment and accessories Minimalist aesthetic apes Tesla but if anything, works a little better The G6’s interior is clearly inspired by the Tesla Model Y - from the huge screen to the minimalist dashboard to the monochrome aesthetic. However, unlike the Model Y, in addition to the massive 15.0-inch touchscreen in the centre you also get a large driver’s display to show speed, assisted driving features and other essentials. That frees the centre screen up to deal with just infotainment, and it does so extremely well. It’s not quite as slick and responsive as Tesla’s system, but it’s not far off, and it feels more modern than the touchscreens you get on a Hyundai Ioniq 5 or Skoda Enyaq - it’s laid out more like a smartphone. There’s a quick-access function bar at the top, and at any point you can swipe up from the bottom for shortcuts to the settings menu, app drawer, and the climate controls. The climate controls are primarily interacted with through the screen, though by default the left-hand bank of steering wheel buttons alters temperature and fan speed when you’re not using the cruise control. Even the direction of the air vents is set digitally, which seems a bit like technology for technology’s sake - though it does mean you can set them up to ‘sweep’ a bit like an oscillating fan. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are present and correct - wireless, with the wireless phone chargers to back them up. But if you’d rather plug in, there are USB-C ports aplenty. Interior quality is pretty good - just about everything you touch is swathed in either soft-touch plastic, artificial leather or fabric trim, and we didn’t notice any creaks or rattles either. However, the dark interior colour does feel rather foreboding, with just a few bits of shiny trim breaking up an unrelenting sea of black - the lighter colour will be less hardwearing, but brightens things up considerably. Xpeng hasn’t loaded the G6 up with quite as many gimmicky or gadgety features as Tesla, though there are a couple of neat ones. Mindfulness mode is rather pointless, suggesting you take half an hour (half an hour!) to meditate in your car - no thanks - but Sleep Mode is a great addition, keeping the G6 ventilated if you happen to be stopping for a nap or even overnight. Something that it’s possible to do, given the seats fold entirely flat and there’s an optional mattress attachment… but the feature is also great for when you need to leave pets in the car for a few minutes. You can control just about all the car’s features from the Xpeng app, including using your phone as a key. You can also use the app to pilot the car into or out of a tight parking space, or keep an eye on it using Sentry Mode. The whole app ecosystem works really well, making many alternatives’ smartphone apps feel really basic in comparison. Electric range, charging and tax Electric range, charging and tax There are two models of the Xpeng G6 available - Standard Range and Long Range. The former claims around 270 miles on a charge, the latter up to 354. The Standard Range car will go further on a charge than an equivalent Hyundai Ioniq 5, while the Long Range car is identically-priced to the base-spec Tesla Model Y with a claimed 311-mile range. And during a week with the Long Range G6, we found it would come pretty close to that figure - over mixed mileage, including motorways, the indicated range ticked down at about the same rate as the miles scrolled past. Expect well over 300 miles on a single charge, a really usable everyday figure. You can top up really quickly too, as the G6 supports 215kW charging on the Standard Range and 280kW on the Long Range - both equate to a 10-80% charge in as little as 20 minutes at a suitably powerful public charger. They also support 11kW home charging. As a fully electric car, the G6 pays the lowest rates of VED and company car benefit-in-kind tax. If you go for the entry-level Standard Range car, you dodge the expensive car supplement on years two to six of your VED bill - though adding even a paint colour to this car will tip you over that £40,000 threshold. Safety and security Safety and security The Xpeng G6 scored a full five-star safety rating from Euro NCAP when it was tested in 2024. Though none of its scores were particularly standout, all were good and well up to the standards of its alternatives. All of the necessary safety equipment is present and correct, and it’s not too difficult to switch off the more annoying ones - in fact, the first time one of them activates, you’ll get a pop-up in the infotainment system inviting you to switch them off. You can also create routines in the infotainment system that turn all of them off when you start the car up, though this feels like a loophole that may soon be patched. Reliability and problems Reliability and problems Xpeng is a new company to Europe and the G6 is a relatively new car. And unlike BYD , MG , or GWM , Xpeng doesn’t have decades of history in its home market to fall back on. However, Xpeng is offering a very generous seven-year, 100,000-mile warranty - the equal of Kia and MG and better than Tesla. The battery gets a separate eight-year warranty. Servicing your Xpeng might be a pain, though, as the brand currently has very limited dealer coverage in the UK. At the time of writing there were just six service centres open, though Xpeng promises over 20 by the end of 2025. Xpeng G6 FAQs Xpeng G6 FAQs"
