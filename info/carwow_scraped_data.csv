https://www.carwow.co.uk/mg/mg3,MG3 REVIEW & PRICES,"£16,995",9/10,"The MG3 used to be a bit of a joke - the old one was the lowest-ranked car on Carwow - but the new model aims to change all that. Now, instead of being antiquated, it’s right up there with the best small cars for performance, efficiency and equipment. Like an air fryer from the middle of Lidl, the MG3’s feature set is as good as any of its alternatives and it’s not immediately clear where the money’s been saved to bring it in at such a low price. Now that it’s a full self-charging hybrid car , the MG3 no longer targets the very cheapest on the market like the Dacia Sandero or Citroen C3 Origin . Instead, it’s more like a cut-price alternative to the Renault Clio E-Tech or Toyota Yaris - a halfway house for people who want the most efficient small car possible, but either don’t want or can’t have a fully electric model. The MG3 won’t win awards for its practicality - it’s not cramped, but it’s no better than average in this regard with a boot that’s about halfway between the Yaris and the Clio in capacity. Rear seat space is moderate, too, though annoyingly the rear seats don’t split when they fold which does limit overall versatility. The front of the cabin looks great, and very modern - in stark contrast to the car it replaces. Poke around and you can find a few places where MG’s saved money - there’s a sliding cover for one of the storage compartments that feels comically flimsy, and the top of the dash and the door cards are made of hard plastic - but the Clio and the Yaris have areas that feel equally cheap. More importantly, MG’s given the 3 its best touchscreen infotainment system yet, and it’s loaded with equipment - climate control, a digital dashboard, sat-nav and a full suite of assisted driving features are standard on every model. The MG’s hybrid system is brand-new, and puts out an impressive 191hp - versus 140hp for the Clio and up to 130hp for the Yaris. That means it’s easily got any of them beat in a drag race, and makes mincemeat of overtakes or motorway sliproads. It’s not quite as efficient as the alternatives, but you might decide that the additional performance makes the small drop in mpg worthwhile. The real surprise is what happens when you reach a twisty road. The old MG3 was always shockingly good fun in the corners, but unexpectedly MG has managed to repeat the trick. The new MG3 handles brilliantly for a small car, and that makes it one of the most enjoyable small cars to drive. Sound interesting?

https://www.carwow.co.uk/mg/hs,MG HS Review & Prices,"£25,995",8/10,"The MG HS has at points been the best-selling car in the UK and it’s easy to see why. It’s a big, practical family SUV with a posh-looking interior, loads of standard equipment and a headline-grabbing plug-in hybrid engine option - but it costs about as much as most small hatchbacks . While the old HS was definitely in the ‘cheap but not very cheerful’ category, the new model actually feels like something you wouldn’t mind driving around - it has redeeming features other than its price tag. It’s a bit like a Harvester - nobody’s ever going to look at it as a high-end option, but if you’re looking to feed the whole family on a budget, it’s tasty enough that you don’t feel punished for your penny-pinching. The HS is a similar size to family SUVs such as the Ford Kuga , Kia Sportage and Nissan Qashqai - but with its low price tag, you might consider it on the same shortlist as much smaller SUVs such as the Volkswagen T-Cross or Ford Puma . Two more direct alternatives are the Citroen C5 Aircross or BYD Seal U - both big SUVs that put affordability first, and have plug-in hybrid engines available. If your main concern is space for the money, the MG HS is a great option. Despite a price tag close to something like a Volkswagen Polo hatchback, it has space in the back for a six-foot adult to stretch out, plus a 507-litre boot that’ll accommodate the whole family’s kit and clobber. You also get a dashboard that looks pretty posh, with a dual-screen setup just like you get on a BMW X3 . You don’t have to press very far to find out where MG’s saved money, though, and materials and build quality aren’t really up to the standards of more expensive cars. It’s also not the easiest to use, with very few physical switches, an awkward touchscreen interface and not much storage for smaller items. As far as engines go, there’s a choice of two. You can have a bog-standard petrol, available with manual or automatic gearboxes - these are the more affordable options, and though they’re not particularly offensive to drive they are a bit thirsty. The headline-grabber is the HS plug-in hybrid, which can do up to 75 miles on a charge. That figure is up there with the best PHEVs on sale, and it gives you tons of flexibility - it’s enough to do even the longest of commutes without troubling the petrol engine once. It also nudges the HS into the lowest-but-one band for Benefit-in-Kind tax, making it hundreds of pounds a month cheaper than the equivalent Kia Sportage or Ford Kuga for company car drivers. Both of those cars are better to drive, mind you - they steer more sweetly and handle bumps better, as well as being more responsive and reassuring in the corners. The gap is narrower if you’re just cruising round town or on the motorway, though, where the HS is impressively refined and difficult to dislike. If the new MG HS seems like the SUV for you, check out our best MG HS deals on Carwow. You can see our other MG deals here, or search for a used MG for sale here. And remember, Carwow can even help you sell your old car ."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/mg/cyberster,MG Cyberster Review & Prices,"£54,995",7/10,"The MG Cyberster is, arguably, the first drop-top electric sports car . It joins a vanishingly small cohort of electric convertibles that includes the short-lived Mini Electric Convertible , colossally expensive Maserati GranCabrio Folgore and the hardly-a-convertible Fiat 500e Cabrio plus its Abarth sibling. The Cyberster represents the meeting of MG’s past and future. The brand’s history is in building convertible sports cars, but the last few years have been all about electrification. It’s like a Silver Cross buggy - inspired by the baby carriages of the past but definitely a product of the present with all the modern features buyers expect. MG’s also been sure to include a few features that nobody was expecting - hardcore MG fans or otherwise. The Cyberster looks like nothing else on the road, with insectoid headlights, squat proportions that make it look quite a lot smaller than it is and a wild rear featuring arrow-shaped taillights and a full-width lightbar. The wow factor increases with the doors, which are electrically-operated scissor doors that open up and away rather than outwards. It’s fair to say that if you arrive somewhere in a Cyberster, you’re guaranteed to make an entrance whether you want to or not - in fact, get used to being stopped in car parks, or having people’s heads turn in traffic. The flip side is that you can’t really arrive anywhere discreetly - and those party piece doors can be frustratingly slow to operate. The interior isn’t short of issues either, most of which come from its eye-catching quadruple-screen layout. That’s right - four screens, with three pivoted towards the driver and a fourth in the centre console for climate controls. Range: 276 miles / 316 miles Efficiency: 3.3-3.7mi/kWh Battery size: 77kWh Max charge speed: 144kW Charge time AC: 10hrs 30mins, 10-100%, 7kW Charge time DC: 38mins, 10-80%, 144kW Charge port location: Left side rear Power outputs: 340hp / 510hp If it sounds confusing, that’s because it is - the outer screens are constantly blocked by the steering wheel, and it’s never particularly clear which functions you control via which screen. At least the driver’s display is clear and concise. The rest of the interior is largely successful. It’s roomy enough, and storage consists of a glovebox, a big shelf behind the seats useful for bags or coats, tiny door bins and a couple of cubbies in the centre console. Material quality is excellent, and build quality isn’t too bad either - not up to the standards of a Porsche , but then the Cyberster makes even the petrol-engined Porsche Boxster look like a bargain. One potential issue rears its ugly head for tall drivers, though, as the seats are set very high. You never really feel as if you’re sat ‘in’ the Cyberster - more like you’re perched on top of it - and if you’re over six feet tall or have a long torso you may find your head brushing the roof. The roof, incidentally, is an electrically-operated fabric affair. It goes down swiftly and can be operated at speeds up to 28mph, which is really useful if you’re hit by a sudden rainstorm, and when it’s up it does a good job of keeping the heat in and the noise out. Not that there’s much noise to be heard. It’s quite disconcerting being in a convertible car that makes nothing more than a soft whirr on acceleration. Like most electric cars, the Cyberster is swift - even the basic rear-wheel drive model will give hot hatchbacks a run for their money, while the fastest dual-motor version has supercar pace. Despite this, it doesn’t feel sporty to drive. The Cyberster is comfortable, quiet and reasonably relaxing, but if you push it into a set of corners you soon feel that it’s a very heavy car with relatively uncommunicative steering. Despite appearances, it’s more of a boulevard cruiser than an out-and-out sports car. You’ll even be able to cruise for a decent distance, with an official range figure of more than 300 miles in the entry-level car. As a package, there’s a lot to love about the MG Cyberster. It’s not a pedigree performance car, but if you’re looking for a drop-top cruiser it does a fantastic job of being comfortable, offering punchy performance when you need it, and feeling largely high quality inside.

You can also browse the latest used MGs from out network of trusted dealers, and when the time comes, you can sell your car online on Carwow, too."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/mg/zs/2018,MG ZS Review & Prices,"£18,605",5/10,"If you’re looking for a small family SUV that’s practical, affordable and reasonably well-equipped, the MG ZS is well worth considering. Okay, it might not feel quite as upmarket as the likes of the Mazda CX-3 but it’s significantly cheaper to buy and much roomier inside. The standard fabric seats come with enough adjustment to get comfortable and the buttons you’ll regularly use are easy to reach and laid out in a logical, uncluttered fashion. Both the Excite and Exclusive trims come with a 10.1-inch colour touchscreen as standard for the infotainment system. You get Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and the Exclusive also has integrated sat nav. The MG’s system is easy to use and responds quickly to your finger on the screen, but some of the menus can be tricky to go back a page, so it’s not quite as intuitive to use as that in a Ford Puma . The back seats don’t get so many nice touches. Although you’ll find there’s much more headroom and legroom than in a Renault Captur , Mazda CX-3 or Nissan Juke , there are no cupholders or centre rear armrest. The 448-litre boot’s roomy too – it’s more than 90 litres larger than the Mazda (350 litres), and 26 litres more than both the Renault or Nissan (422 litres). It's more than big enough to carry a large baby buggy and some big soft bags at once. Flip the back seats down and there’s just enough space to carry a bike with its wheels attached. You can get the ZS with two petrol engines. Pick the 1.0-litre turbo petrol if you spend lots of time driving around town or the 1.5-litre petrol model if you do lots of motorway miles. Both are relatively quiet – if not particularly quick – and will return around 35mpg in normal conditions compared to MG’s claimed 44.9mpg and 49.6mpg respectively. There's also the MG ZS EV - one of the most affordable electric SUVs on sale - that we've reviewed separately. Here we're focused purely on the petrol model. Whichever engine you pick, the ZS is easy to drive thanks to its adjustable steering that provides extra assistance at slow speeds. Unfortunately, the view out the back isn’t great, which can make squeezing into tight parking spaces a bit tricky – but at least rear parking sensors as standard. You even get cruise control on all models to help make long drives a bit more relaxing. Unfortunately, the ZS is quite noisy at motorway speeds and you’ll hear quite a bit more wind and tyre noise than in the likes of the Mazda, and it isn’t as comfortable over bumpy roads as the Citroen C3 Aircross. Unlike these alternatives, the MG doesn’t come with the option of automatic emergency braking to help stop the car quickly if it senses an obstacle ahead. As a result, it has only managed a three-start score from Euro NCAP . If this isn’t a dealbreaker for you, the MG ZS makes a strong case for itself as an affordable, yet spacious, small family car. Avoid the rather spartan entry-level models and it’s an SUV that’s well worth considering. Should the MG ZS be the car for you, make sure you check out our latest MG ZS deals and browse our used MG ZS models. You can also look through other used MGs to find out how much you could save when buying through carwow. You can also sell your car through carwow, where our dealers will bid on your car to get you the best price."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/mg/mg-4,MG4 EV REVIEW & PRICES,"£26,995",8/10,"MG pulled an absolute blinder with the MG4, and much like the lovable underdog in a boxing movie it punches well above its weight division. It’s more affordable than alternatives such as the Renault Megane E-Tech and Cupra Born , costing around the same as the smaller Vauxhall Corsa Electric and Fiat 500e . You’d be forgiven for thinking that MG have taken a ‘cheap and cheerful’ approach to engineering the MG4, but that’s far from the truth. So far from it, in fact, that the MG4 received high commendations in the 2024 Carwow Car of the Year Awards’ Outstanding EV and Urban Living categories. Just look at it, a mix of pointy details, sharp creases and funky shapes such as the lower body cladding and split roof spoiler. It’s a refreshing looking thing; it still stands out against newer MGs such as the MG S5 and MG HS as much as it does its alternatives. Range: 218-331 miles Efficiency: 3.6-3.8 miles per kWh Battery size: 51kWh / 62kWh / 74kWh Max charge speed: 150kW Charge time AC: 6hrs 12mins, 10-100%, 7kW / 7hrs 30mins, 10-100%, 7kW / 9hrs, 10-100%, 7kW Charge time DC: 39mins, 10-80%, 150kW / 35mins, 10-80%, 150kW Charge port location: Left rear Power outputs: 170hp / 204hp / 245hp It’s a shame the interior isn’t quite as novel, with a dashboard layout that’s so simple it verges on boring, but the material quality, fit and finish and standard kit is better than you might expect for the price. A 10.25-inch infotainment display comes as standard on all trim levels of the MG4, and though it comes with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, MG’s own software is rather basic. It’s frustrating to operate too, especially on the move, with too many menus to navigate. There’s plenty of room in the MG4 though; plenty of adjustability for you to get comfy behind the wheel and enough head and leg room for tall passengers in the rear - though it’s a bit of a squeeze when you’ve got three in the back. The 363-litre boot capacity trails the Volkswagen ID3 for space, and puts it well behind the Megane E-Tech. The MG4 comes with two battery options, offering 218 claimed miles of range in its most basic trim through to 323 miles for the Trophy Extended Range model. The top-rung MG4 XPower , which we’ve reviewed separately, offers a big power hike over the rest of the trim levels, but makes do with a 239-mile range. Around town the MG4 is easy to potter about in thanks to its light steering, peppy electric motors and most importantly, its comfortable suspension. It takes potholes, speed bumps and cracked roads in its stride, and the same applies to motorways where the MG4 just soaks up the miles with ease. Yet even with its soft suspension the MG4 is rather fun to drive on a twisty road, feeling agile and grippy with little in the way of body lean. The X-Power is particularly rapid, but it’s different enough that we've reviewed it separately here. For a stonking value for money proposition, have a look at our new MG4 deals as well as our MG4 lease deals . You can also check out used MG4s from our network of trusted dealers as well as other used MGs . When it’s time for a change, you can even sell your current car through Carwow."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/mg/4-xpower,MG4 EV XPOWER REVIEW & PRICES,"£36,495",7/10,"This is the MG4 XPower, and it’s a bit like a supermarket's own-brand vindaloo – packing plenty of heat at a value price. It’s a car you’d consider if you’ve been waiting for the dawn of the electric hot hatch , but the higher-power variants of the Cupra Born or Volkswagen ID3 just don’t offer enough punch for you. Not that the looks of the XPower would suggest it’s the exciting version – not a great deal of change has been made over the base MG4. Orange brake callipers and new 18-inch wheels give the game away if you know what you’re looking for, as do a few polished trim pieces, but the bodywork is otherwise untouched. The stealthy vibe may appeal, but there’s a case to be made that MG could and should have done more to shout about the car’s performance. Similarly, there’s very little difference inside compared with the standard MG4 . Aside from some Alcantara seat and door inserts, as well as a touch of red stitching, there’s nothing to scream XPower here. Material quality continues to impress for the price, but a dull selection of colours and a basic design does nothing to add to the excitement the car’s power promises. Also retained for the XPower is the 10.25-inch infotainment system, packed with sat nav along with support for Android Auto and Apple CarPlay . A few welcome quality-of-life improvements have been made to the software, as well as a basic ‘Track Mode’ app that gives you real-time access to G-force and acceleration data. As with the base MG4, rear passenger space is impressive, with a decent amount of head and legroom even for taller adults. Boot space is also untouched at 363 litres, which is marginally behind the Volkswagen ID3’s 385 litres. The big changes for the MG4 XPower lie under the skin. As well as more power for the rear motor, a second motor has been added to the front axle too, combining to produce 435hp and 600Nm of torque. The result is 0-60mph in a mind-boggling 3.8 seconds (for context, that’s quicker than a Porsche 911 Carrera 4) and an increased top speed of 124mph. It’s not just the off-the-line performance that’s so impressive either, with a real gut-punching kick from 30-70mph too. To help cope with that extra power, MG has made some mechanical tweaks as well. An electronic locking differential has been added alongside a torque vectoring system, which combine to manage how power is distributed to the wheels through corners. The suspension is the same as the base MG4, though with new tuning for the springs and dampers. Though the result is a car that’s certainly capable when you throw it through the bends, it’s not particularly involving. Dull steering makes it difficult to feel how much grip the front wheels have, and even the mechanical upgrades can’t hide the fact this is quite a heavy car. You may outrun a Honda Civic Type R or Hyundai i30 N , but you won’t have as much fun in the twisty stuff. On top of that, because of the suspension tweaks, the MG4 XPower crashes over bumps in the road more so than the regular car, though otherwise remains pretty comfortable around town. At motorway speeds though, you do really notice the wind noise as well as a slight whine from the new front motor. Official range figures from the 64kWh battery dip from 270 miles in the Long Range car to 239 miles for this sporty XPower model. A mixed driving route with the car for this test returned 2.9 miles/kWh, equating to around 185 miles of real-world range. For stomach-churning, sports-car troubling performance at a value price, the MG4 XPower delivers big. That said, traditional hot hatch buyers may struggle to be won over by quite a muted driving experience beyond the numbers. Looking to make this electric hot hatch your next car? Check out the latest MG4 XPower deals available through Carwow, or browse used MG4 models from our network of trusted dealers. If you’re selling your car online , you can do that through Carwow too, along with browsing a wide range of used MGs available now."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/mg/5,MG5 EV REVIEW & PRICES,"£31,005",6/10,"This is the MG5 EV, and it’s one of very few electric estate cars currently available in the UK – the others being the Porsche Taycan Sport Turismo , Vauxhall Astra Sports Tourer Electric and Peugeot e-308 SW . It’s a bit like doing your shopping at Lidl or Aldi. On the face of things, you may dismiss the MG5 as simply being a value option - but if you’re clued up, you’ll know there’s much more to it than that. The MG5 was given a design overhaul in 2022 and it was much-needed, though it also came with a small bump in price. The dowdy car of old has been replaced with a stylish new look, sporting sharp lines in the bumpers and wide, narrow headlights. It’s not quite as striking as the Carwow 2023 Car of the Year, the MG4 hatch, though. On the inside, the MG5 isn’t quite as smart either, but it’s a definite improvement over the pre-revision car. Build quality is really good and there’s a respectable amount of plush-feeling materials. Fabric seats come as standard, though range-topping models get a leatherette set. Sitting at the heart of the dashboard is an updated 10.25-inch infotainment system. It’s certainly a leap from the older, sluggish screen and, if you’d rather mirror your smartphone, it comes with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay as standard. It does retain a part-digital, part-analogue driver’s display, though this feels pretty clunky and would work better as a fully digital unit. There’s lots of knee and headroom in the back seats of the MG5, however a raised footwell does leave your rear passengers angled rather awkwardly. As for boot space, you’ve got 580 litres to work with in the MG5. That’s only slightly down on the Toyota Corolla Touring Sports’ 598 litres, so it’s a useful space that will easily carry large suitcases. Choosing the motor and battery is easy, because, well, there is no choice. Whichever MG5 trim you choose you get a battery with a usable capacity of 57kWh and a 156hp motor. That said, driving range is 250 miles in the entry-level SE version or 235 miles in the higher-spec Trophy model, thanks largely to the bigger alloy wheels. The MG5 is comfortable in town and on the motorway, and you get the MG Pilot safety system as standard, which includes assistance kit such as adaptive cruise control and lane-keep assist. If you like the sound of the MG5 EV you can check out the latest new deals now or browse used stock from dealers near you. You can also take a look at other used MG models . Want to sell your car online ? Well, Carwow can help with that too."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/mg/gs,MG GS Review and Prices,"£15,430",5/10,"The MG GS is a medium-sized family SUV that’s a little larger than the likes of the Nissan Qashqai and Renault Kadjar, yet costs a little less. Unfortunately, some of the MG’s penny-pinching is all too obvious, such as the brittle interior plastics and second-rate infotainment system. From the outside, the MG GS looks more like a jacked-up hatchback than most family SUVs. It sports all the black plastic bumper trims you’d expect of a chunky pseudo-off-roader, but the MG GS’ curvy bumpers, slim brake lights and raked roofline look sportier than the comparatively boxy Kia Sportage and Hyundai Tucson. Unfortunately, the MG GS’ interesting exterior only serves to show how dull and drab its interior is. It’s neatly laid out and all the buttons are grouped together so they’re easy to reach, but almost every surface comes with a hard plastic finish and the optional brushed-metal effect trims don’t feel anywhere near as robust as they look. You can have contrasting inserts fitted to the dashboard and doors, but these do little to spruce up the GS’ interior. Equally middling is the touchscreen infotainment system. It’s easy to read but nowhere near as intuitive as the systems you get in most alternatives. What it loses out in technology, the GS claws back (albeit only slightly) in terms of practicality. There’s just as much room in the front seats as you get in the likes of the Nissan Qashqai and there’s more space for carrying three adults at once in the back. The MG GS might appeal if you’re looking for something practical and likely to stand out, but it isn’t particularly good to drive and doesn’t feel as well built as most other family SUVs. It’s a similar story when you need to load the MG GS’ boot. It’s bigger than the Nissan’s and there’s no load lip which makes it easy to slide in heavy boxes. You can fold the back seats down if you need to carry seriously bulky stuff, such as a bike. It’s a shame you can’t get the MG GS with a diesel engine to help you carry very heavy luggage or tow a trailer, though. Instead, it comes with a 1.5-litre 166hp petrol unit. At least it feels fairly spritely and trundles along at motorway speeds relatively quietly – if not particularly economically. Head off the motorway and you’ll find the MG GS doesn’t feel particularly relaxing to drive. Its suspension is firmer than in the likes of the Nissan Qashqai so you’ll feel more of a thud each time you hit a pothole around town. At least you get a decent view out and the optional automatic gearbox you can get in top-spec models means you don’t have to make endless gear changes in heavy traffic. Unlike most SUVs, you can’t get the GS with automatic emergency braking, lane-keeping assistance or driver tiredness detection. As a result, you’ll be better off looking elsewhere if safety is your number one priority. But, if you’re after a sporty-looking yet practical SUV on a shoestring budget, it could be worth a look. Check out our MG GS deals to see how much you can save on one."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/mg/s5-ev,MG S5 EV Review & Prices,"£28,495",8/10,"The MG S5 is the sequel to the MG ZS EV - it’s a compact, all-electric SUV , and like the rest of MG’s range majors on value-for-money - putting it right in the firing line of really excellent electric cars such as the Volvo EX30 , Kia EV3 and Skoda Elroq . It’s also the first MG we’ve reviewed that doesn’t really have any caveats - no ‘it’s great for this, but…’ modifiers need to be added. While that does mean it’s not quite as standout as MG’s other cars, like the cheap-as-chips MG 4 or the BIK champion MG HS , it also means that it’s easier to recommend for more people. It’s like a chef who starts their career out with wild and divisive combinations like salmon teacakes with a candyfloss mousse, but matures into making a really solid sea bass with risotto. Like some of the most reliable dishes, the new S5 EV doesn’t exactly shout about its prowess. The styling is the first thing to get past - or the lack of styling, you could say. The S5 EV looks as though MG’s design team started with a normal SUV and then Photoshopped out any of its distinguishing features. While this definitely means it blends into the crowd, you’ll have to be a really magnolia kind of person to be excited by its featureless front end or lower grille ‘inspired’ by the Cyberster sports car. Range: 211 - 298 miles Efficiency: 4.3 - 4.7 mi/kWh Battery size: 49kWh/64kWh Max charge speed: 120kW/139kW Charge time AC: 7hrs / 9hrs 15m @ 7kW Charge time DC: 24min / 28min 10-80% Charge port location: Left rear Power outputs: 170hp / 228hp Things start to look up when you get inside, though. The S5 EV has MG’s best interior to date. Just about everything you touch is covered in soft-touch material, and you really have to look quite hard to find any cheap, nasty plastics - that’s not something you could say about the MG 4, which shares its underpinnings with the S5 EV. Better yet, MG’s listened to feedback from reviewers and journalists, and implemented a few features to make life just that little bit easier. There are physical climate controls underneath the screen so you don’t have to go rootling round in touchscreen menus just to change the temperature, and there’s an easy shortcut to switch off the more annoying driver assistance features too. The S5 EV is great for families as well, as it has bags of rear legroom and a 453-litre boot - nearly matching the roomy Kia EV3. There are two models available - a Standard Range car that can do up to 211 miles on a charge and a Long Range variant which claims up to 298 miles of range. It’s a shame MG has no plans to introduce an Extended Range model, as that could really take the fight to the Kia EV3 which has up to 375 miles of range. So behind the dull looks, the MG S5 EV is really quite a good electric car indeed. If you’re interested, you could check out our best MG S5 EV deals here, or find a great MG S5 leasing offer. You can browse used MGs for sale here, and remember that Carwow can even help you to sell your old car when the time comes."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/mg/zs,MG ZS Review & Prices,"£19,995",7/10,"The previous-generation MG ZS was a small SUV that you’d buy because it was cheap - and then spend the rest of your time apologising for it. It was unattractive, thirsty, poor to drive and had a really cheap-feeling interior. However, the second-generation model has had a true Cinderella-style glow-up, and should push the old car right to the back of everybody’s minds - it’s a huge improvement in every way. Based on the same mechanical underpinnings as the excellent MG3 hatchback, the new ZS gets an up-to-date hybrid engine, techy interior and a smart - if not stunning - new look. It’s like trading in your old Nokia for a new smartphone. Probably not the latest Apple iPhone, as MG is still firmly a budget brand - more like one of those off-brand Android phones that gives you lots and lots of bang for your buck. As a small hybrid SUV , there are alternatives to the MG ZS coming from every corner. Some of the best include the Renault Captur , the Hyundai Kona Hybrid , the Peugeot 2008 or the Carwow award-winning Toyota Yaris Cross . MG does things a bit differently to those cars, though. First of all, there’s the way the hybrid system works. It’s far more powerful than any of those alternatives - with 191hp beating out 140hp in the Captur or a measly 115hp in the Yaris Cross. MG’s done this by fitting a more powerful electric motor and a bigger battery, which means that most of the time it drives like an electric car with a petrol generator. However, if you put your foot down both power sources will give their all, making this quite a rapid little SUV. The comparison is also pretty favourable when it comes to interior space. The ZS has enough room for a six-foot adult to sit behind a driver of the same size in comfort, which means it’s also great for child seats or lanky teenagers. The 443-litre boot is also bigger than the hybrid Renault Captur or the Toyota Yaris Cross, and only marginally smaller than the Hyundai Kona hybrid. It’s in the cabin where you notice evidence of MG’s cost-cutting, though - there are plenty of low-rent material choices, and infotainment software that despite being a huge improvement on the old ZS isn’t as easy to use or as intuitive as the best systems out there. You do get loads of equipment, though. The top-spec Trophy model is still inexpensive but comes with climate control, sat-nav, smartphone connectivity, leather upholstery and a full suite of driver assistance tech including the semi-autonomous MG Pilot system. To drive, it’s another huge leap from the old car, which was pretty dire on the road. The ZS isn’t as satisfying to drive as a Renault Captur or Toyota Yaris Cross, despite its superior power output - but it has light controls and good visibility, making it great around town. Only poor refinement on the motorway and quite crashy suspension let the side down. If lots of power and equipment for a low price capture your imagination, check out our best MG ZS deals right here.

https://www.carwow.co.uk/mg/zs-ev,MG ZS EV Review & Prices,"£30,505",7/10,"The MG ZS EV is an electric SUV that goes up against the likes of the Hyundai Kona Electric and Kia Niro EV – both of which are now well-established options at the affordable end of the electric car market. It’s a bit like going for a pair of cheap Bluetooth headphones. It might not be from the obvious choice of brands, but it promises to do a similar job at a lower cost. Since its revival as a mass-production manufacturer, MG’s models haven’t been the most exciting to look at. The new ZS EV is in a similar vein, but this updated version now comes with a blanked-out grille and LED headlights as part of a tweaked front end. There is also a new rear bumper with altered lights. MG has also improved the interior design, with the main addition being a new 10.1-inch infotainment touchscreen that has updated software to make it much smoother than before. A 7.0-inch driver display has also been added that offers efficiency and safety information. But where alternatives may offer slightly more comfort and refinement, you’ll find a lot of scratchy plastics alongside the new carbon fibre-effect upholstery finish on the dashboard and leather trim on the seats. In the back, you have decent legroom behind even the tallest of drivers. But as the batteries are mounted under the floor, your knees end up quite high. Headroom is also not the best, with the panoramic sunroof on Trophy models eating into the space even more. Taller passengers may struggle to get comfortable in the back. With an adjustable boot floor as standard, you get 470 litres. This is on par with the Kia Niro EV 's 475 litres, but is 140 litres more than the Hyundai Kona Electric 's offering. Folding the seats down creates a 1,100-litre space, but the seats don’t quite fold flat. The ZS EV comes with two battery options. The 51kWh Standard Range and 72kWh Long Range options offer up to 198 and 273 miles respectively. When driving in the real world across multiple conditions and in all three driving modes – Eco, Normal and Sport – you get closer to 240 miles. But leave it in Normal mode and you’ll get nearer to the claimed figure. Around town, the steering feels light and accurate. It also doesn’t allow many bumps into the cabin at slow speeds, with the suspension setup in normal mode helping it out. On the motorway, you’ll notice a lot of tyre noise and, if you go for the top-spec Trophy version, the roof rails do make a slight whistling noise. It feels comfortable on the whole, but the seats don’t have as much cushioning or support as you might like. When applying Sport mode and tackling a country road, the ZS feels pretty stable. It isn’t the most engaging car in the world and it can scrabble for grip in damper conditions – but for most that won’t be much of an issue. With its competitive pricing and practicality, the ZS EV is a model you should consider. It may not be as refined as alternatives, but it can certainly be a useful option if you’re in the market for an efficient SUV .

https://www.carwow.co.uk/omoda/omoda-5,OMODA 5 Review & Prices,"£25,915",6/10,"In the early 2000s it was Hyundai and Kia that were offering cheap ‘n’ cheerful cars with loads of standard equipment and small price tags - in the 2020s, it’s the Chinese. Omoda is the latest Chinese car brand to hit the UK, and it’s doing so with this - the Omoda 5 SUV. And in the same way that a Greggs opening up shop next to a local bakery will cause some raised eyebrows, the Omoda aims to offer customers the same stuff they’re used to, but at a lower price. Other budget SUVs it’s taking aim at include the MG HS , Skoda Karoq and our favourite, the Citroen C5 Aircross . A quick word about Omoda. While the brand is new to the UK, it’s been on sale in Asian territories for a while and is an offshoot of one of China’s biggest manufacturers - Chery, which sells about as many cars worldwide as Tesla. So don’t go thinking this is a bit player. There’s certainly nothing surprising about the styling. The Omoda 5 could charitably brand itself as ‘inspired’ by existing SUVs rather than straight copying them - this does mean it’s pretty bland and inoffensive to look at, though the glitzy grille is a little brash. Sculptured flanks, ‘upside-down’ headlight arrangements and a full-width element joining the rear lights is all pretty par for the course. It’s smart, but you won’t stand out in a crowd. For interior space, the Omoda 5 lags behind the competition. It’s not a particularly small car, but rear legroom is quite poor and headroom in both rows of seats is pretty dreadful. Small rear doors also make loading child seats a pain, and the boot is a cramped 380 litres in capacity - about the same size as a regular family hatchback’s. The 5 does win back some points when you look at the standard equipment list, though. Even the base-spec ‘Comfort’ model gets all-round LED lights, a twin-screen dashboard setup, heated and electrically-adjustable front seats, and wireless smartphone connectivity. You also get a powerful 190hp engine and an automatic gearbox. If you went to Volkswagen with the same amount of money burning a hole in your pocket, they’d be able to sell you a basic-spec T-Cross with a five-speed manual. Despite the powerful engine, the Omoda 5 isn’t sporty to drive, or particularly satisfying. It’s quite quiet out on the road, but the soft suspension gets easily unsettled on poor road surfaces and the gearbox has a tendency to be dimwitted, especially around town. And what you save in purchase price, you’ll pay for at the pumps. Fuel economy from the Omoda 5 is very poor compared to most alternatives, and high CO2 emissions means it’s not going to make it on many company car lists. For a more appealing alternative here, you could try the all-electric Omoda E5 instead. If the allure of a powerful engine and loads of standard equipment for not much money gets you, then check out our best Omoda 5 deals here. You can check out our other favourite family cars and SUVs too, and remember Carwow can even help you sell your old car when the time comes."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/omoda/omoda-9,OMODA Omoda 9 Review & Prices,"£44,990",Not found,"You could be forgiven for getting a bit confused by the proliferation of new Chinese brands arriving in the UK — is it time for a BYD , or is this an Xpeng? — but Omoda is one of the bigger fishes in the Chinese car industry. It’s one of the export brands ( Jaecoo is the other) of the huge Chery Automotive Group, which made some 2.6-million new cars last year. So while the Omoda 5 , which launched here in the UK in 2024, might have had mixed reviews, this Omoda 9 is another step on from that model, and aims to take on the serious premium badge players at a much more affordable price. While you can accuse the Omoda 9 of looking a bit generic, it’s a bigger car than the 5, and so some of the same styling touches — the big grille, the slim LED lights — work a little better on the bigger canvas The 9 ends up looking rather more handsome - the way the grille at the front blends in with the bodywork is actually quite Peugeot -esque. There are also flush door handles, smart alloy wheels, and at the back a sort of Skoda -meets- Audi kind of look. It’s not bad, actually. Inside, if anything, the Omoda 9 is even more generic. You could be sitting in anything from a KGM to a Cadillac, and without the badges it might be kind of difficult to tell the difference. Omoda claims that the 9 comes with a vast 24.6-inch display for the dashboard, but that’s not quite right. There is a 24.6-inch display area, but it’s actually two conjoined 12-inch screens, one for the instruments and one for the infotainment , so that’s basically pretty conventional. Beneath the screen are three large physical dials (hurrah!) for the climate control system, set into a rather gaudy chrome trim. The seats, big and comfy, get a nice quilted leather effect that’s probably supposed to look a bit Bentley -ish, but ends up being a bit closer to the DFS sale. On the tech front, the stereo is supplied by Sony, and those seats are heated and ventilated. Omoda doesn’t do different specs — you just get everything as standard in one model. Power comes from the same 1.5-litre petrol engine that you’ll find in the smaller Omoda 5, which might sound like a disappointment but it’s tied into an impressive plug-in hybrid system, which uses a massive 34.4kWh battery — that’s a bigger battery than some small electric-only cars use. Total power is a whopping 446hp, so no wonder Omoda calls this the ‘Super Hybrid System’ or SHS. It’ll haul this big SUV to 62mph in just 4.9 seconds. More importantly, for most people, the big battery means that you can go for a claimed 93 miles on one charge, without ever needing to wake the 1.5 petrol engine up. The Omoda 9 can fast-charge from a DC public charging point at up to 70kW, which is handy if you want to top up on a long journey. Speaking of which, Omoda reckons that on a full tank and a full charge, the 9 will go for 700 miles before it needs a top up. However, some buyers won’t be fond of the 40g/km official CO2 figure, which is higher than some other PHEVs and so makes the Omoda 9 a little less tax-friendly. If you’re interested, you can check out our best Omoda 9 deals here, or find a great Omoda 9 leasing deal here. You can find a used Omoda 9 for sale, or browse other used Omodas for sale too.

https://www.carwow.co.uk/omoda/omoda-e5,OMODA E5 Review & Prices,"£33,065",6/10,"If you’re looking for an electric car that’s anything but the obvious choice, the Omoda E5 could be the SUV for you. This, and the petrol-powered 5 , are the first models to be sold in the UK by Chinese car maker Omoda. It’s a bit like saying no to a Microsoft Surface laptop and picking a Huawei MateBook instead. While you might not have heard of Omoda, the E5 is an alternative to lots of similarly priced electric SUVs from companies you probably have heard of, including the Volvo EX30 , Smart #1 , Hyundai Kona Electric and Skoda Enyaq . The Cupra Born is another option if you’re not totally committed to the SUV body shape. The Omoda E5 isn’t the most stylish thing to look at. The electric version gets a smoother front end than the petrol model’s mega-grille, and you get narrow daytime running lights that look pretty cool at night, but it’s a largely bland and inoffensive design. Range: 257 miles Efficiency: 3.8 miles per kWh Battery size: 61kWh Max charge speed: 80kW Charge time AC: 8hrs, 0-100%, 11kW Charge time DC: 28mins, 30-80%, 80kW Charge port location: Front Power outputs: 204hp It’s much better inside. The overall design is smart, the materials look good quality, and largely feel pretty premium to the touch. The massive twin-screen setup works pretty well – both displays have sharp, bright graphics and are pretty snappy to respond to your inputs, though some of the menus are really confusing to find your way around. Funnily enough, it’s a similar story with other Chinese brands , BYD and MG . Ergonomically it’s less positive. The steering wheel and driver’s seat don’t have enough adjustment, and the pedals are quite close, so it’s a struggle to find a comfortable driving position. The centre console is also too big and intrudes into your personal space, so it’s difficult to relax your left leg on long journeys. And when it comes to practicality, the E5 is a bit of a reverse Tardis, because when you look at the outside you’re expecting it to be a bit more roomy inside than it is. Space in the back is limited in particular, and it can be a bit of a faff to fit a child seat, while storage throughout is fine but about the minimum you’d expect. The boot is smaller than alternatives, too. At 380 litres it’s only a fraction down on the Cupra Born, but that car is a hatchback . SUVs like the Hyundai Kona Electric and Skoda Enyaq have massive boots by comparison, though the Smart #1 lags well behind all here. You have one choice of battery and motor in the Omoda E5, with a 204hp output and an official range of 257 miles, which is about the same as you get from entry-level versions of the alternatives we’ve been looking at here, all of which are a bit more expensive than the Omoda. Fast charging speeds are pretty poor, which can be annoying on long trips, but efficiency is decent, so it’ll be a bit cheaper than your average EV to run. The recurring theme with the Omoda E5 is that it’s fine, but others do it better, and that’s also true of the way it drives. The suspension is soft so it soaks up bumps pretty well, and the steering is well-tuned so it’s easy to place the car on the road, but there’s quite a bit of tyre noise at higher speeds. It’s not particularly fast, but it goes round corners without feeling like it will fall over. It’s good enough if you don’t care about how a car drives, but the Cupra Born and Hyundai Kona Electric in particular feel more satisfying to drive at any speed. As a first entry to the UK market this is an intriguing electric SUV. It’s packed full of technology for the cash, and looks pretty upmarket inside, but it falls behind other options in most of the key details. It’s a bit cheaper than those cars, but budget-allowing, they’re worth the extra cash. If you want to get a great price, check out the latest Omoda E5 deals on Carwow. You can also browse used Omoda models from our network of trusted dealers, and when it’s time to sell your current car, Carwow can help with that, too."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/volkswagen/t-roc,Volkswagen T-Roc Review & Prices,"£28,825",7/10,"The Volkswagen T-Roc is a bit like a Stanley cup - it’s slightly posh, pretty expensive and incredibly popular. Volkswagen sells almost as many T-Rocs as it does Golfs, so chances are if you’re looking for a small SUV , you’ve got a T-Roc shortlisted. Luckily this Volkswagen does have quite a lot to recommend it. It’s practical, pretty good to drive, and has the enduring appeal of the Volkswagen badge. The T-Roc sits between the T-Cross and the Tiguan in Volkswagen’s range of SUVs. It’s more stylish than the boxy T-Cross, and as well as the standard SUV can be had as the hot T-Roc R or the interesting T-Roc Convertible , both of which we’ve reviewed separately. It was launched in 2017 and underwent a pretty hefty facelift in 2022. If you’re in the market for a small SUV, the T-Roc is just one of many cars you might be considering - and impressive alternatives include cars like the Peugeot 2008 , Skoda Kamiq , and Ford Puma . The T-Roc may not be particularly glitzy on the outside, but it’s stylish in a solid, classy way - and that continues on the inside, with an interior that’s more function over form but still operates well and feels quite good to sit in. Space is decent; though the back seats are only average, you do get a very big boot. Big rear doors make it excellent for child seats, too, and the T-Roc did score five stars in Euro NCAP’s crash-testing which is reassuring if it’s going to be used as a family car. It’s pretty well-equipped as standard, too. Even entry-level cars get an 8.0-inch touchscreen that’s easy to use with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto as standard, plus a digital driver’s display, climate control, all-round parking sensors and some smart storage solutions. You do, however, pay handsomely if you want to move up the model range. The basic Life trim isn’t too expensive, but if you want the posher R-Line car with a more powerful engine the price jumps up quite a lot. With a few optional extras you can easily push the price over £40,000 - you can get a really nice BMW X1 M Sport for that sort of money. The T-Roc does drive quite well for a small SUV, though. None of the engines have any hybrid or electric trickery, but that keeps the overall weight low - and that means it corners nicely and feels light on its feet around town. The engine range is good too, and there is even a diesel option and four-wheel drive available - both increasingly rare among compact SUVs. At the entry level, there’s a 1.0-litre petrol with just 115hp which feels a bit sluggish. The 1.5-litre petrol with 150hp is probably the best all-rounder, with manual or automatic gearboxes available - while the 200hp 2.0-litre petrol is somewhat overkill. The diesels are great for very long-distance drivers, with miserly fuel consumption, but you won’t get the best from them around town. If you like what you hear you can see how much you could save with Carwow’s Volkswagen T-Roc deals . You could also get a great deal by browsing used T-Roc models , as well as extensive stock of other used Volkswagens from our network of trusted dealers. When it’s time to sell your car , Carwow can help with that, too."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/volkswagen/polo-gti,Volkswagen Polo GTI Review & Prices,"£30,740",8/10,"The Volkswagen Polo GTI is a small family car that’s practical, well built and fast enough to keep up with some sports cars on a tight country road. In this respect, it’s a bit more like a retired greyhound than the yappy, terrier-like Ford Fiesta ST . It might spend most of its time sleeping on your slippers in front of the fire, but it’s still happy to show other dogs a clean pair of heels (or paws) playing fetch in the park. Sadly, this tempting combination doesn’t come cheap, but at least the VW Polo GTI’s upmarket interior helps justify its price tag. Its cabin shares most of its trim with the already pretty posh Polo so it feels more special than a Fiesta ST. You get a pair of very supportive sports seats (upholstered in VW’s signature GTI tartan), shiny red inserts and a digital instrument panel is now standard, following a 2021 revision. Thankfully, these sporty additions haven’t made the VW Polo GTI any less easy to live with than the standard Polo – it’s still one of the most spacious and practical small cars around. There’s loads of adjustment to help you get comfy in the front seats and enough room in the back for six-foot-tall adults to sit behind an equally tall driver. The VW Polo GTI’s practicality is streets ahead of the competition. There’s significantly more space in the boot than you get in the Ford Fiesta ST or Mini Cooper S and it feels more comfortable and more grown-up than these cars around town, too. It’s easy to drive and – with the optional adaptive suspension fitted – it soaks up bumps and potholes impressively well for a small hot hatch , which you would usually expect to be quite bouncy. Head out onto an empty country road and the VW Polo GTI’s powerful 2.0-litre turbocharged petrol engine and boisterous exhaust noise certainly help it stand out. That 2021 update gave the Polo GTI more power than before — 207hp — meaning it’ll sprint from 0-62mph in 6.5 seconds and its sporty suspension helps it feel stable at speed and grip keenly in tight corners. It might not be quite as agile as the smaller Ford Fiesta ST but driving the VW Polo GTI is more relaxing for long periods and it’s quieter at motorway speeds – especially now that radar-guided cruise control comes as standard. You even get an automatic DSG gearbox as standard in all VW Polo GTIs, so you can rest easy knowing the car provides hot-hatch thrills in a more mature package than any other alternative. See how much you can save on your next car by visiting our VW Polo GTI deals page, or check out all our latest Volskwagen deals .

https://www.carwow.co.uk/volkswagen/golf,Volkswagen Golf Review & Prices,"£28,010",8/10,"It’s fair to say that the Volkswagen Golf defines the family hatchback - it’s the benchmark by which all of its alternatives such as the Ford Focus , Vauxhall Astra and Honda Civic are measured. At the same time, it’s posh enough that you could quite happily compare it to upmarket cars such as the BMW 1 Series or Audi A3 . The Golf is the Coca Cola or Heinz Ketchup of cars - it’s been the default choice for an astonishing amount of buyers in its five decades on sale. And just like coke or ketchup, while there may be alternatives or new players that offer something different - perhaps, in some situations, better - the default choice is still extremely good and hard to top. The current Golf is the Mk8 model, which was first launched in 2020. An update in 2024 took into account customer feedback and made myriad small tweaks and improvements, particularly to the interior and software. The exterior hasn’t had such a big makeover. The new headlights - full LED on all models - are smart, and on some versions joined by a light bar and even an illuminated VW logo. The taillights are slightly updated, too, and the bumpers have been redesigned. It’s still not what you’d call a particularly exciting-looking, but it is smart and inoffensive - which is more than you can say about the latest BMW 1 Series. Inside, the Golf still retains its trademark solid feel which has been an enduringly popular feature ever since the Mk4. For 2024, Volkswagen took in customer feedback, and as a result the new model replaces the old car’s touch-sensitive steering wheel buttons with a full range of physical switches. The infotainment’s had a serious refresh too, featuring far more user-friendly software, illuminated sliders underneath the screen for quick access to volume and temperature controls, and even the AI ChatGPT built in to answer questions that the native voice assistant can’t figure out. The Golf remains as practical as ever - that is to say, totally middle of the pack. There’s more room for rear passengers than you find in a Mercedes A-Class or BMW 1 Series, but a Skoda Octavia and Ford Focus are more capacious. The boot measures 381 litres, which is again firmly average, for a totally average-sized hatchback. If you need more room, the Golf Estate has an enormous boot and slightly more rear passenger space, while being usefully cheaper than the larger Volkswagen Passat. In contrast to most alternatives, which offer fewer and fewer engines as the years go on, the Golf is available with a huge range of different options. There’s a 1.5-litre petrol, with or without a mild hybrid system and available with two power outputs, with a 2.0-litre version on the way. There’s even a choice of two 2.0-litre diesel engines, perfect for milemunchers. Two plug-in hybrids complete the engine range - a normal model badged eHybrid and the sporty-looking GTE . A refreshed Golf GTI and Golf R will join the range later. Whichever engine you choose you can be assured of a relaxing journey - the Golf majors on its feeling of solidity, refinement and stability. No, it’s not as much fun to drive as a Ford Focus or BMW 1 Series when the road gets twisty, but it’s not too far off, especially if you choose one of the models with adjustable suspension. Higher-powered cars also get more sophisticated rear suspension that helps you corner more quickly and without so much lean. With so much choice in the range - six engine options, five trim levels (plus the standalone GTE) and a massive selection of optional extras, there is a Golf for pretty much anybody - but they’re all damn good cars. Head on over to the Volkswagen Golf deals or other new Volkswagen deals pages to see how much you can save through Carwow. Alternatively, check out offers on used models or sell your car through Carwow."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/volkswagen/polo,Volkswagen Polo Review & Prices,"£21,470",8/10,"Much like a designer sofa, the Volkswagen Polo takes an everyday item and puts a posh spin on it. It’s comfortable and has a bit more pedigree than its alternatives; while other small hatchbacks are more fun to drive, the Polo is the one you’d rather be seen in. Not that it’s the best of the bunch, because there are plenty of great hatchbacks on sale such as the Renault Clio and Peugeot 208 , or electric and hybrid alternatives such as the Renault 5 and Toyota Yaris . It’s a smart looking thing, if not particularly exciting. There are loads of sharp lines around the small hatchback, with funky creases running down the Polo’s flanks, and intricately detailed LED lights on the front and back. It’s definitely more stately than sporty, and there’s more than a whiff of ‘honey I shrunk the Volkswagen Golf ’ about it. Though when you sit inside, it feels anything but small. It’s more spacious than a lot of cars this size, with a wide dashboard and a glossy trim that wraps around onto the door cards. Material quality is high, with loads of soft-touch plastics and only a few scratchier surfaces lower down in the cabin. Unfortunately it is a little dour inside, as the only colours you can choose from are black and dark grey. Boo. The Polo is easy to get comfortable in thanks to its highly adjustable front seats and steering wheel. There’s plenty of space in the back with enough headroom and legroom for rear passengers to remain comfortable on long drives - no mean feat in a small hatchback . You get a good amount of standard kit in the Volkswagen Polo, such as a swish digital driver display and an Apple CarPlay / Android Auto -enabled touchscreen infotainment screen in the dashboard. The lack of physical shortcut buttons means it can be a pain to use on the move though, and its glossy screen is a magnet for finger prints. There are no diesel options available for the Polo, just a 1.0-litre three-cylinder petrol engine with a few different power outputs. The entry level 80hp model is fine for pottering around town, but you’ll want the 95hp or 115hp version if you regularly travel on the motorway or on country lanes. Regardless of which engine you chose, the Polo is a comfortable car in town. It does a great job of absorbing lumps and bumps in the road, but its soft suspension means it doesn’t feel particularly agile on a country lane. Motorways are a breeze too, but it’s a shame you can only have a manual model with a five-speed gearbox as you do get a bit more engine noise and a bit less efficiency than you would with an extra gear. If B-road bashing is important to you then the Volkswagen Polo GTI (which we’ve reviewed separately) might be the best choice, with a much more powerful 2.0-litre turbocharged engine and stiffer, sportier suspension. Have a look at Volkswagen Polo deals on Carwow, or Polo lease deals for an alternative way to get behind the wheel of this posh little hatchback. You can also check out used Volkswagen Polos from our trusted dealer network, as well as other used Volkswagens if you’re open to a bigger car.

https://www.carwow.co.uk/volkswagen/multivan,Volkswagen Multivan Review & Prices,"£49,613",8/10,"If you’ve got a lot of people to transport, then seven-seat SUVs are all well and good - but most of them are cramped in the third row and not really suited to being fully laden with adults. What you really need is an MPV - and the Volkswagen Multivan is the best of the lot. Despite the ‘van’ in its name, not to mention its boxy looks, the Multivan actually shares more of its DNA with the Volkswagen Golf rather than the Transporter panel van. That does mean a pretty hefty price tag, but think of it like buying an American-style fridge-freezer. There are cheaper ways to keep your food cold, but it’s a great way to ensure you have enough space - and it’s more stylish than many alternative solutions. If you find yourself looking at the Volkswagen Multivan you probably have proper van-based MPVs on your shortlist - cars like the Ford Tourneo Custom, the Renault Trafic Passenger or the Mercedes V-Class . Other seven-seaters you might be looking at include the Land Rover Discovery or BMW X7 - or, if you know you’ll only need the third row occasionally, smaller options like the Peugeot 5008 . None of these can hold a candle to the Multivan’s interior, though. As standard, you get seven separate seats that slide and fold with space for an adult in each one. Opt for the long-wheelbase model and they’ll have room to stretch out. On some models you have an even more opulent six-seater layout, while on others you can turn the centre row around for a conference-style setup. Add in a clever sliding central table, cupholders galore, and enough USB ports for everyone to charge their gadgets, and you can see why the Multivan is a parent’s dream for keeping children in the back comfortable and occupied. Life’s good for the driver, too. The Multivan feels like a car up front, with digital instruments, comfortable seats and a big central touchscreen that controls almost everything. It feels like a car to drive, too - admittedly a large and heavy one. The Multivan’s available with a surprisingly perky petrol engine, some efficient diesels and even a plug-in hybrid model which has the potential to really slash your running costs if you can keep the batteries topped up. It’s rather expensive to buy, though not too bad if you’re comparing it to top-end versions of other people-carriers. But you get what you pay for here, and if you’re sensible with the extensive options list the Volkswagen Multivan is an absolutely cracking MPV. Interested?

https://www.carwow.co.uk/volkswagen/id3,Volkswagen ID.3 Review & Prices,"£30,860",8/10,"The Volkswagen ID3 is basically the electric car equivalent to the Volkswagen Golf . It’s a mid-sized family hatchback which is the baby of Volkswagen’s EV range. Launched in 2019 and updated in 2023, the ID3 will fall on your shortlist if you’re considering other small-ish electric cars such as the Kia EV3 , MG4 EV , Renault Megane E-Tech , or Tesla Model 3 . The ID3 is as futuristic as it gets from Volkswagen, but being the brand of the ‘people’s car’ such modernism still has to be user-friendly and carefully implemented. A bit like trying to introduce your grandma to her new mobile phone. Before its facelift, the ID3 didn’t do this especially well and attracted criticism for its awkward user interface, but the 2023 update went a long way to addressing this with a new infotainment system and improved interior materials. The ID3 is a different shape to most hatchbacks - it’s quite tall, almost like a mini- MPV. A short bonnet, steep windscreen and big wheels all mean it stands out from the crowd. It’s not exactly handsome, but it’s a clean design - improved in the 2023 facelift which took away a set of silly decals that used to be standard on the rear pillar. Range: 261-369 miles Efficiency: 4.1-4.3 miles per kWh Battery size: 52kWh/ 58kWh / 77kWh / 79kWh Max charge speed: 120kW / 170kW / 185kW Charge time AC: 9hrs 30mins, 0-100%, 7kW / 12hrs 40mins, 0-100%, 7kW Charge time DC: 35mins, 5-80%, 120kW / 30mins, 5-80%, 170kW Charge port location: Right rear Power outputs: 170hp / 204hp / 326hp It’s even more minimalist on the inside. You get very few physical buttons, with most controls being routed through either the 12.9-inch touchscreen display or the touch-sensitive steering wheel buttons. In a bid to remove as much switchgear as possible Volkswagen’s even shunned separate controls for the rear windows. All this tech can be quite annoying to use - particularly the touch-sensitive sliders underneath the infotainment screen, which aren’t backlit at night and are really tricky to find when you’re driving. Space in the cabin benefits from the ID3’s tall silhouette, with good headroom and plenty of legroom. There’s a totally flat floor and the centre console is low, giving a nice feeling of airiness - helped by loads of glass, particularly the extra windows in the windscreen pillars that give you a good view at junctions. There are a choice of battery sizes and electric motors. The basic ‘Pure’ models can go around 240 miles on a charge and have modest performance, but you can step up through Pro and Pro S models with increasingly bigger ranges. The top model is the GTX - a performance-biased model that gets a sporty makeover, the biggest battery and the most powerful electric motor. All ID3s are rear-wheel drive and feel nice and solid on the road. Bumps and potholes are a bit too obvious, especially in models wearing the largest 20-inch alloy wheels, but the steering feels accurate and the turning circle is really tight. It’s good on a longer run too, with punch acceleration and good refinement at a cruise. What it’s not is particularly exciting - even the hot hatchback-like ID3 GTX. There’s a nice sensation that the rear-wheel drive is pushing you out of corners rather than pulling you around them, but otherwise there’s little enjoyment to be had - instead it feels neutral and safe. So while the VW ID3 is a pretty good electric car, it’s also one that struggles to stand out - there are loads of cheaper alternatives which are just as practical and feel every bit as solid and reassuring, even if they don’t quite have the Volkswagen’s badge kudos. If you’re interested, check out the best Volkswagen ID3 deals right here on Carwow. You can get a great price with our Volkswagen ID3 leasing deals , or find a used Volkswagen ID3 for sale too. And remember, Carwow can even help you to sell your old car when the time comes."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/volkswagen/t-cross,Volkswagen T-Cross Review & Prices,"£25,115",8/10,"The Volkswagen T-Cross is a small SUV that’s among the best in its class. If you’re a couple or a small family and you have your heart set on an SUV, then the T-Cross is a car you should be shortlisting - it drives like a hatchback, has the practicality of a mini-MPV, feels better inside than many premium models yet it’s one of the cheapest cars Volkswagen sells. The T-Cross definitely punches above its weight, then. It’s a bit like a roast chicken dinner - not flashy, not complicated, but still excellent and hits the spot most of the time. The T-Cross is based on the same underpinnings as the VW Polo hatchback, and isn’t much bigger in terms of its footprint. That means it has tons of similarly-sized SUV alternatives - from the mechanically-related SEAT Arona , to the sporty Ford Puma and the plush Peugeot 2008 . Climb inside, and you’ll find the T-Cross has loads of room courtesy of its nice squared-off body. It’s one of the roomiest cars for its size, with space for six-footers to stretch out in the back especially with the neat sliding rear seat which allows you to balance legroom and luggage space. Front passengers are well treated too, and the T-Cross’ raised ride height lets you tower over most family hatchbacks for a great view out. An update in 2024 improved the interior finish of the T-Cross. While older cars felt decidedly cheap and plasticky, the newer model has much nicer materials, particularly across the face of the dashboard and on the door cards where your arm rests. It also improved the technology, tidied up the trim levels, and crowd-sourced the name for the bright yellow paint (Rubber Ducky Yellow - brilliant). It also removed the very sensible physical climate controls for an awkward touch-sensitive panel, though, so it’s not all positive change. In contrast to lots of other small SUVs, you won’t find a hybrid option or a fully-electric version of the Volkswagen T-Cross. Three engines are available - a 1.0-litre petrol with 95hp or 110hp, or a more powerful 1.5-litre with 150hp. Of these, we reckon it’s the middle engine that’s by far the best - it’s powerful enough, very efficient and can be had with manual or automatic gearboxes. Regardless of engine, the T-Cross is a competent car to drive. It’s not fun like a Ford Puma, and a Citroen C3 Aircross irons out the bumps more effectively, but the little VW feels solid, reassuring and stable. Combined with a refined interior and nicely supportive seats it’s a great little SUV to cover long distances in. Get offers from trusted dealers on this car by having a look at the Volkswagen T-Cross deals . If you're in the market for a used Volkswagen T-Cross , or any other used Volkswagen for that matter, then you can find some great examples at Carwow.

https://www.carwow.co.uk/volkswagen/tiguan,Volkswagen Tiguan Review & Prices,"£35,385",8/10,"The Volkswagen Tiguan has one of the simplest recipes of any family SUV . It looks good without being too in-yer-face, is spacious without being intimidating to drive in town, and has a lovely interior without being so posh you’re scared to get your kids’ grubby figures anywhere near it. All features that earned it a Highly Commended award in the Family Values category of the 2025 Carwow Car of the Year Awards . It’s the spaghetti bolognese of the car world. It might be simple but there’s rarely a circumstance where it doesn’t hit the spot. However, like your spaghetti is just one of a number of pasta dishes you could order, there are numerous Tiguan alternatives that are similarly sized, similarly priced SUVs. Go for a top-spec model and it’s an alternative to posh SUVs such as the Audi Q3 and BMW X1 , though it does lack some of their badge appeal. Or you could consider an entry-level version alongside a well-specced Nissan Qashqai or Kia Sportage . Where the Volkswagen Tiguan has an advantage over all of those cars is its boot, which at 652 litres is considerably bigger than anything else at a similar price. That means you’ll be able to fit prams and after-school sports equipment all at once, should the need arise. The interior design is all-new, with a massive infotainment touchscreen in the centre of the dashboard, making it not far off those upmarket BMW and Audi alternatives. There are configurable shortcut buttons across the top and bottom of the display, with the large central home screen showing the sat nav, music and other important information. It’s quick to respond to inputs and has bright, clear graphics, but you still get Volkswagen’s unintuitive touch-sensitive sliders for the climate control. On the plus side, you also get an excellent digital instrument display, which is included as standard and bigger than the one on the old Tiguan. The exterior hasn’t had quite such an extensive overhaul as the interior, but the old Tiguan was starting to look dated, so the sleek LED headlights that run into a full-width black panel give it a fresh new look. At the back, you get a similar light panel that runs along the bootlid, but the likes of the Kia Sportage are more interesting to look at. A diesel engine is a rare treat these days for those who do big miles, but one of the two petrols will be a better fit for most drivers. A pair of plug-in hybrids are on the way later in 2024, with a useful electric-only range of 62 miles. They will be a bit more expensive than other engines but low running costs could make it the best pick if you have access to regular charging. It’s worth waiting for the plug-in if you need a company car , because it will have the lowest Benefit-in-Kind tax rate by far. There will be no electric Tiguan, so check out our list of the best electric SUVs if that’s what you’re after. Behind the wheel, the Tiguan is quiet, comfortable and refined to drive around town and on the motorway. The suspension is well-judged, so that it soaks up big bumps without causing the body to wobble around. This makes the Tiguan a great car for daily driving duties, but the light steering and refined suspension mean it’s not the most exciting car on a twisty road, even if you pop it into its sportiest setting. If you like what you hear you can see how much you could save with Carwow’s Volkswagen Tiguan deals . You could also get a great deal on the outgoing car by browsing used Tiguan models, as well as extensive stock of other used Volkswagens from our network of trusted dealers. When it’s time to sell your car , Carwow can help with that, too."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/volkswagen/id7,Volkswagen ID.7 Review & Prices,"£51,005",8/10,"The fourth model in Volkswagen’s electric car line-up, the ID7 is a family saloon with a sporty design that should appeal to you if you haven’t succumbed to the SUV fever that has taken hold of buyers in the last decade or so. As a left-field alternative to the SUV, it’s a bit like sticking with skinny jeans when the on-trend fashionable types have moved on to baggier ones. First impressions are strong, with the long ID7 (it’s a shade under five metres from bumper to bumper) looking like a modern family car, with a swooping roof that makes it look slick and sporty. Inside, there’s plenty of space throughout, with a lot of legroom and headroom – despite the fact that the ID7 has the lowest roof of any of VW’s electric models. The boot has a 532-litre capacity, increasing to 1,586 litres if you lower the rear seats, so it should be enough for most family uses. If not, the more practical ID7 Tourer could be worth waiting for. Helping to make the cabin more airy is an optional full-length glass roof with smart glass, where the layers of glass in the sunroof can be electronically switched between opaque and clear, using a slider in the roof or voice control (which we’ll come to in a minute). Car manufacturers are very keen on introducing new technologies in their shiny, new zero-emissions vehicles: in this case, Volkswagen’s nifty innovation is an augmented-reality head-up display (HUD) , which comes as standard on all ID7s. The HUD is some pretty clever tech, but it’s also significant because it has a knock-on effect on the layout of the cockpit. The traditional instruments become smaller (because the driver won’t need to look at them as much) which is an innovation that works well, while Volkswagen has also given the infotainment system a more intuitive menu structure on its 15.0-inch touchscreen. Another way in which the ID7 hints at what will be the norm in future cars is the voice control feature. Voice controls aren’t new, by any means, but systems like the ID7’s are now more like the ones on smartphones, responding to commands or questions that are spoken more naturally. Whether that means it will interrupt the conversations between the driver and front-seat passenger (awkward!) remains to be seen. In the future, it'll even be integrated with AI functionality from ChatGPT. As the ID7 is a relatively large car, there’s plenty of room under the floor for a battery pack – and the first versions of the model to go on sale have a 77kWh battery. This bigger-than-average battery means that the ID7 has a range of up to 386 miles, with its 286hp motor enabling a respectable 6.5-second 0-62mph time. A version with an even larger battery will arrive later in 2024 with a range of about 430 miles – enough to drive from London to Edinburgh without stopping (theoretically, although your bladder might have something to say). The onboard charging system is pretty state of the art, too. You can charge an ID7 on one of those fancy (and expensive) ultra-rapid chargers at the motorway services, taking enough electricity in 10 minutes to cover 126 miles: you can also charge a battery at 10% up to 80% in 28 minutes. If all this sounds good, keep reading for our full take on the ID7. You can take a look at our latest VW ID7 deals here, or take a look at used examples of some of the other Volkswagen ID models , such as the ID4 and ID5 . Want to sell your car ?

https://www.carwow.co.uk/volkswagen/t-roc-cabriolet,Volkswagen T-Roc Cabriolet Review & Prices,"£35,675",7/10,"Tastes change. Remember when everybody used to smoke? Not so much, these days. People used to exclusively buy family hatchbacks , too, but now the family SUV is in vogue. And now stepping on to the catwalk are open-top SUVs like the Volkswagen T-Roc Cabriolet. This look might take a little longer to hit the high streets, but it makes sense when you think about it. We used to happily buy open-top hatchbacks, so why not open-top SUVs? And as they go, the Volkswagen T-Roc Cabriolet isn’t half bad. It has a chunky, upright stance and clean lines roof up or down that’ll certainly turn heads. Inside you get the usual VW quality and straightforward logic in terms of design, plus its latest touchscreen infotainment systems. Like the standard T-Roc , the Cabriolet will seat five people, and with only two doors the space between its front and rear wheels has been extended to allow more room for those in. the back. However, at 284 litres its boot will be noticeably smaller than the standard car’s. Dropping the electrically operated roof takes 11 seconds. Only petrol engines are offered in the T-Roc Cabriolet – either a 110hp 1.0-litre three-cylinder or 150hp 1.5 four-cylinder, with the latter also having a choice between a six-speed manual or seven-speed automatic gearbox. There are just two trims to choose between too, either Style or R-Line, the former being cheaper and focused on comfort, the latter more expensive with a more aggressive, sporty look inside and out. So, if you loved open-top hatchbacks but want to be bang on trend, then this could be the car for you. Head over to our Volkswagen T-Roc Cabriolet deals page to find the very best prices on one, or check out the latest used examples from a network of trusted dealers.

https://www.carwow.co.uk/volkswagen/taigo,Volkswagen Taigo Review & Prices,"£24,770",7/10,"The Taigo is one of Volkswagen ’s vast range of SUVs , offering a unique coupe-styled rear end as its USP and slotting in just above the T-Cross in both size and pricing. The basic design is rather similar, sharing much with both the smaller SUV and the one-size-up T-Roc . Think of the Taigo as the nearly identical twin with the cooler haircut. You get the same face as the Polo hatchback alongside some additional trim pieces to make it more aggressive and crossover-like, while there’s now a lightbar connecting the headlights like most newer VW models. It’s got a sleek side profile, ending with a small spoiler on the roofline. You also get some SUV-style cladding around the wheel arches and additional detailing around the back. ‘Taigo’ is also written out under the number plate and rear lightbar, and the roof bars add to its SUV feel. You can also choose from multiple two-tone paint options on the mid- and top-spec models. It doesn’t have the most exciting cabin, but you’re able to get a 10.0-inch touchscreen alongside a digital instrument display – the latter of which comes as standard. You also get climate controls with proper easy-to-use dials right out of the box, but higher-spec models get the annoying sliding touchbar setup introduced in the latest Golf . This doesn’t work very well. Still, there’s decent space up front and visibility is okay – even if the rear window is a bit small. That said, adult passengers will find the second row a bit tight for space. The roof slopes slightly so taller people will struggle to get completely comfortable, while legroom is also a bit limited. You get 438 litres of storage capacity in the boot and the load lip is quite small. The Taigo’s boot is larger than what you'll find in the Kia XCeed , SEAT Arona and Peugeot 2008 , but the Ford Puma is a bit more spacious. You can also fold the rear seats down to be almost flat and open up even more storage space. VW has changed its trim line-up across its models, so with the Taigo there’s only three you need to choose from – Life, Style and R-Line. You get decent equipment levels across all three, with R-Line giving you the sportiest finish both inside and out. You get a choice of two engines, both of which are petrol. The 1.0-litre three-cylinder comes with two power options – 95hp or 110hp – while the four-cylinder 1.5-litre is only offered with 150hp. You can have manual or automatic transmissions across the line-up, apart from the top-end power option that can only be had with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. Choosing the 110hp will give you more than enough power to work with, while the six-speed manual transmission is smooth and easy to use. The automatic is okay, but just be wary of it being jerky on getaway. When you get out on the road, the Taigo feels stable and secure – but if you’re after an exciting and invigorating experience, you may want to look elsewhere. The suspension soaks up the majority of bumps on the road well, with only the largest ones making an impact on the cabin, especially on the 17-inch wheels. Around town, the Taigo has light steering to make skipping in and out of traffic very easy. It’s compact enough for most spaces too, even the smallest ones in car parks. Then out on the motorway, it’s very easy to live with, as there’s only a slight wind whistle from the roof rails and wing mirrors. Tyre noise can be intrusive on larger wheels though. Even though it isn’t the most exciting, the Volkswagen Taigo is a capable compact crossover at the more affordable end of the market. Some of the interior finish might not be the best, but the overall quality is more than good enough for most. If you’re interested in this affordable coupe-styled SUV, why not check out the latest Volkswagen Taigo deals on carwow, where you can see how much you can save on a new car. You can also check out the latest used VW Taigo stock as well as browsing other used Volkswagen deals . You can also sell your car online through carwow."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/volkswagen/id5,Volkswagen ID.5 Review & Prices,"£41,090",6/10,"Much like a Golden Retriever in a baseball cap and running shoes, the Volkswagen ID5 is the sporty-looking version of the sensible ID4 electric SUV . It’s much the same car, but where the ID4 has a big, boxy rear end the ID5 has a rakish roofline instead. You still get tall, bluff front and rear ends - a la ID4 - with big, aggressive head lights and curves aplenty. At the back is the same light bar too, but the ID5 has a little boot spoiler on the edge of the tailgate. It’s a decent looking thing, less frumpy than the ID4, though still less distinctive than the Audi Q4 e-tron Sportback and Skoda Enyaq Coupe . At first glance the interior is much the same fare as the outside, sleek and minimalistic with a few swoopy lines on the dashboard and a pair of modern-looking displays. It doesn’t take long to realise that the interior quality isn’t up to par though, with far too many scratchy, hard plastics in easy to reach places spoiling the cabin. Range: 226-344 miles Efficiency: 3.7-3.9 miles per kWh Battery size: 52kWh / 77kWh / 79kWh Max charge speed: 135kW Charge time AC: 12hrs, 0-100% at 7kW / 8hrs, 0-100% at 22kW Charge time DC: 30 mins, 20-80% at 135kW Charge port location: Left right Power outputs: 170hp / 286hp / 344hp It’s a shame as there are some really clever touches inside the ID5. The latest version of the infotainment is slick and easy to use, unlike some recent Volkswagen attempts, and the optional augmented reality head-up display is reassuring on the motorway as you don’t need to look away from the road as often. Yes the touchscreen climate controls are still a bit fiddly to use, but they don’t take long to get used to. The seats are especially comfortable with loads of adjustability, and there’s good front cabin storage including a deep centre console cubby and big door pockets. The rear bench is comfy, with good legroom and a surprisingly large amount of headroom for such a low roofline. It’s just a shame the boot’s shape is compromised by the sloping tailgate, because while it’s larger than the ID4’s at 549 litres, you can’t fit particularly boxy items in. Still, with a comfy interior and a big boot the ID5 makes for a great road trip EV, especially with a claimed range of up to 343 miles with the biggest battery. The entry-level model has a smaller battery with a max range of 226 miles. We managed respectable efficiency of 3.6mi/kWh on a long drive, largely on the motorway, in the long range model. That equates to a real-world range of 277 miles - 80% of Volkswagen’s claim. A twisty road is far from fun in the ID5 though, with steering that’s devoid of any sense of what the front wheels are doing. You need to put a lot of angle into turning the steering wheel, even in sport mode, so while there’s plenty of grip you’re best off driving the ID5 at a moderate pace. Motorways are much better, even if there’s a touch too much wind noise, but the clever suite of driving assistance tech combined with a good high-speed comfort make the ID5 an easy car to cover ground in. The city is where it feels most at home, though it’s a tricky car to place on the road. The bonnet lines make it hard to judge the ID5’s size, which combined with the slow steering and spongy brakes can knock your confidence when manoeuvring down a tight city street. Bigger bumps are absorbed rather effectively, but potholes and cracked roads aren’t smoothed out as well as they are in alternatives such as the Volvo EX30 and Kia EV6 . Good looks, useful practicality and real-world efficiency mean the ID5 is a perfectly adequate family SUV, but it does lose its shine thanks to some disappointing driving characteristics and questionable interior materials. Still, it’s worth considering, so you can check out our new Volkswagen ID5 deals or have a look at our ID5 leasing options instead. You can also browse used ID5s from our network of trusted dealers, or other used Volkswagens if you’re open to other options.

https://www.carwow.co.uk/volkswagen/touran,Volkswagen Touran Review & Prices,"£39,135",7/10,"The Volkswagen Touran doesn’t look exciting at all, but the payoffs for its high roofline and slab-sides are lots of interior space and huge doors for great access – making it one of the most practical family cars you can buy. It also has seven seats, and those big rear doors mean anyone with a degree of flexibility can access the back row, which – unusually for a seven-seater – can accommodate an adult so long as they’re under six-feet tall. That means there’s plenty of room back there for kids. The middle row, meanwhile, has three individual seats that slide backwards and forwards, so adults will have no trouble getting comfortable. Both front seats are height adjustable too. The Volkswagen Touran only has a 137-litre boot with all seven seats in place, which is barely enough space for a weekly shop – so if you need to carry seven people and their things then the larger Volkswagen Sharan will be a better bet. However, the Volkswagen Touran’s boot grows to a whopping 937 litres when the car’s in five-seater mode. Factor in the 47 separate smaller storage areas that are dotted around the interior and few cars this size can compete with the Touran’s practicality. You’re not going to buy a Volkswagen Touran on account of its interior style. It has none of the flamboyance of the now discontinued Citroen Grand C4 Spacetourer , but it does have a straightforward layout and build quality that feels like it’ll stand up to years of use. A lot of thought has gone into the design – simple mechanisms make the seats really ease to fold, the cup holders have a sprung grip that wraps around energy drinks as easily as they hold a can of coke, and the picnic tables on the backs of the front seats have a ratchet function that holds them in place even if you lean on them. These are the things you’ll appreciate for years to come. The Volkswagen Touran is a safe car too. It scored five stars when Euro NCAP crash-tested it in 2015, but it’s worth upgrading from S to SE models and above just to get automatic emergency braking fitted as standard – it’ll reduce the chance of low-speed crashes. The Volkswagen Touran’s once broad selection of engine options have been whittled down to just one 148hp turbocharged petrol unit. It’s perky and efficient though, and is available in manual or automatic form. You’ll be surprised at how well the Volkswagen Touran drives. Although it looks like a van, it doesn’t feel like one – in corners it feels like a taller VW Golf . It doesn’t lean much going around corners and the light steering makes it a doddle to park and easy to use around town. In fact, ‘easy to use’ pretty much sums up the Volkswagen Touran. It does exactly what it says on the tin – it’s built to carry people comfortably and easily, and it doesn’t let frivolities such as sexy styling and sporty driving dynamics steer it off course from its main objective of being family friendly."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/volkswagen/golf-gti,Volkswagen Golf GTI Review & Prices,"£40,735",7/10,"A staple in the world of the hot hatchback , the venerable Volkswagen Golf GTI was one of the first of the breed - and one of the best too. It’s been a shining example of a car that can do it all for decades, blending every day sensibility with usable performance in a sporty package. Think of the Golf GTI as a husky in sheep’s clothing, rather than a wolf. It looks unassuming to most people, but when you engage the Golf’s sporty driving modes and point it at a nice road it’ll chase down more powerful cars without ever feeling scary. The game has moved on though, and the Golf GTI has some serious hot hatchback competition these days. From the hardcore Honda Civic Type R and pocket rocket Toyota GR Yaris to the uber rapid - but uber expensive - Audi RS3 and Mercedes A35 , the Golf GTI seems a little…mild. Even its own Golf R sibling has the GTI licked for outright pace and cornering grip. A 2024 update came to the Golf GTI’s rescue though, bringing with it the introduction of the latest GTI Clubsport model - which sits above the regular GTI with more power, sportier driving modes and dartier steering. It feels like what the Golf GTI should have been all along, but we’ll come back to that. The update saw the GTI gain some sportier bodywork and posher lights, though the illuminated badge is something the Golf could have done without; a bit chintzy for an otherwise classy car. It’s a handsome thing, if not exciting, but it does look purposeful in an ‘if you know you know’ kinda way. Inside is a similar story, with the classy, high-quality Golf interior spruced up just a touch with splashes of red trim, red ambient lighting and a GTI-specific steering wheel. While the current generation of Golf was launched in 2020 with one of the worst infotainment systems we’ve seen in recent years, the updated system is a comparative joy to use. Dashboard shortcut buttons would still be appreciated, but Volkswagen ditching the infuriating touch-sensitive steering wheel controls is a huge win. There’s good space in the cabin and the seats are supportive, though rear legroom can be a little tight for tall passengers; fixed front headrests can induce neck ache for short passengers on long drives too. The 374-litre boot is smaller than some alternatives but it’s a useful shape and plenty big enough for four hand-luggage sized suitcases. As has been the way with Golf GTIs for decades, it’s one of the most refined hot hatchbacks you can buy. It’s comfortable around town, even in Clubsport trim, and while it’s notably stiffer than a regular Golf over bumps you’re rarely ever left wincing through potholes. Motorways are fantastic in the GTI with little in the way of wind noise and well-behaved driver assistance systems. Road noise is a bit too loud in the Clubsport though, especially over rougher motorway sections, though it’s never unbearable. B-roads should be where the GTI feels most at home, but sadly Volkswagen’s engineers have been a little too sensible when setting up the hot hatch. It’s never unsettled by bumpy corners and it feels fairly agile, but it’s just a little… numb. The Clubsport, again, remedies that to a certain extent. It’s much more direct than the standard car, with the wheels eagerly following your steering input and the car rotating well when carving through corners. It just feels a bit more old-school, and fun as a result, but while it’s a big improvement on the GTI it’s still some way off the Civic Type R. As a comfortable all rounder the GTI is a solid choice, so you should have a look at the latest Volkswagen Golf GTI deals on Carwow to get a great price on one. Check out Golf GTI lease deals for a different route to getting into one, or browse used Golf GTIs from our trusted network of dealers. There are other used Volkswagen models available, and Carwow can help when it’s time to sell your car too."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/volkswagen/idbuzz,Volkswagen ID. Buzz Review & Prices,"£59,135",9/10,"The Volkswagen ID Buzz is one of the most recognisable electric cars on sale - and despite being a combination of a van and an MPV , neither of which are particularly au fait bodystyles with car buyers, it’s also one of the most desirable. With styling inspired by the classic Volkswagen Microbus, the ID Buzz is proof that a chic and appealing electric car doesn’t have to be an SUV . It’s a bit like upcycling an old piece of furniture - taking an old concept and bringing it into the modern age, but retaining the style and character that made it popular in the first place. As a large, premium electric car, the ID Buzz is a great - and family-friendly - alternative to SUVs such as the Tesla Model Y , Skoda Enyaq , Kia EV9 or Peugeot E-5008 . It’s also a compelling fully-electric alternative to the fantastic Volkswagen Multivan . The design is the primary reason for wanting an ID Buzz. It looks fantastic - it may be slab-sided and boxy, but the devil's in the detail. Glam alloy wheels, rounded edges, and a distinct styling line running around the middle which also serves to divide the great-looking (optional) two-tone paint finishes. There are three distinct versions of the ID Buzz available, with five, six, or seven seats. The latter also gets a longer wheelbase and body, making it an alternative to proper electric people-carriers such as the Ford E-Tourneo Custom - but the shorter models are more nicely proportioned, and still offer a practical, square interior with a huge boot and sliding doors for easy access. Speaking of the interior, it’s a little less eye-catching than the exterior - it uses the same components as Volkswagen’s other ID electric cars, which means a big touchscreen infotainment system and precious little in the way of physical switchgear. There are some nice nods to its van heritage, though, such as a useful sliding centre console and a multi-level boot floor. Space for passengers is excellent, though the ID Buzz isn’t really a true MPV - the seats don’t fold or disappear quite as readily as they do in something like the smaller Volkswagen Touran . It’s a very spec-dependent interior, too. On mid-range Style models, where you can get a light-coloured dashboard and fantastic colour-matched upholstery, it feels really airy and cheerful. On the range-topping GTX, despite the cavernous space on offer, the all-black finish makes it feel positively pokey. There are three trim levels available for the ID Buzz and two choices of electric motor - the regular version or the higher-powered GTX. Even this supposed ‘sporty’ model isn’t much fun to drive, though - the big, heavy Buzz is at its best when it’s driven more gently. Do so, and you’ll find that it’s quite relaxing and comfortable, though those massive wheels can crash into potholes and over speed bumps. The best version of the Buzz has a range of 292 miles, which is pretty good albeit not quite up to the best electric SUVs . But this really isn’t a car that you buy entirely with your head. So if your heart has decided the ID Buzz is the car for you, check out our best Volkswagen ID Buzz deals , or get a great Volkswagen ID Buzz lease deal. You can see used ID Buzz models for sale, or find other used Volkswagens for sale. And remember that Carwow can even help you to sell your old car , when the time comes to move on."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/volkswagen/golf-r,Volkswagen Golf R Review & Prices,"£45,660",9/10,"The Volkswagen Golf R is the halo version of the ubiquitous hatchback ’s range, and a 2024 update brought much-needed improvements to the infotainment system, as well as a welcome dose of extra performance. The R is in distinguished company, with all-wheel drive hot hatch alternatives including the Audi S3 , BMW M135 and Mercedes-AMG A35 , with less refined, more driver-focused options such as the Honda Civic Type R and Toyota GR Yaris also on the radar. If the standard Golf is a korma then the R – with the extra power that comes as part of the latest update – is like ordering a vindaloo, then sprinkling chilli flakes on top. The updated version of the Mk8 Volkswagen Golf R – known as the 8.5 – gets more aggressive styling than the regular Golf, but the update also brings with it new bumper designs, LED headlights and an illuminated VW badge up front. The jury’s still out on that one. Inside there’s one key change. The infotainment system is much-improved, with a bigger display, faster processing and redesigned interface that’s more intuitive to use. It’s still some way off the best alternatives, and we still encountered frustrations with smartphone connectivity, for example, but it’s much better than before. Sadly the infuriating touch-sensitive steering wheel buttons, dropped from the rest of the Golf range, remain in the R. Outside of the on-board tech the Golf R’s cabin is a pleasant place to sit. You get comfortable yet figure-hugging sports seats and a chunky R-specific steering wheel with larger shift paddles, while space and storage are decent. You get some nice sporty touches, such as a suede-like material on the doors and seats, blue stitching and R-specific displays, but on the whole the cabin doesn’t feel quite up to the quality of other circa-£45k hot hatches such as the Audi S3. The Golf R loses out a little to alternatives in the practicality stakes, with only the S3 having a smaller boot capacity. At 341 litres the Golf R’s boot will be fine for most, but a Honda Civic Type R should be top of your shopping list of boot capacity is important. There’s also the Golf R Estate if you want more space. While there are a few pros and cons in terms of practicality and technology, there’s very little to complain about once on the road. The Golf R is one of the most engaging hot hatches to drive and its all-wheel drive system contributes to it being an incredibly capable car in corners. There’s loads of grip, and with all that power you shoot out of corners full of confidence. Importantly, it’s also more fun to drive than its predecessor. The fun factor is helped a bit by the extra power on offer. The 2.0-litre engine makes 333hp, up from 320hp, and has an official 0-62mph time of 4.6 seconds. However, we matched this in damp conditions, demonstrating how rapid this family hatchback really is. There are some compromises, with the suspension being a bit less comfortable than a regular Golf when driving around town, and you get more road noise at motorway speeds, too. These feel like fair concessions for a car that’s so good on a twisty stretch of Tarmac. If you’re looking for a new hot hatch, check out the latest Volkswagen Golf R deals on Carwow. You can also get a great price on a used Golf R , as well as other used Volkswagens , from our network of trusted dealers. When it’s time to sell your current car , Carwow can help with that, too."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/volkswagen/id4,Volkswagen ID.4 Review & Prices,"£39,590",7/10,"You love SUVs and more and more of you are loving electric cars, that makes the new Volkswagen ID4 electric SUV a case of possibly the right product at the right time. Although, with some impressive alternatives like the Tesla Model Y and Nissan Ariya also joining the fray, it doesn’t quite have things all its own way. The VW ID4 is about the same size as the company’s Tiguan SUV and should be just as practical – but a bit more futuristic-looking. If you and your sibling are the VW Golf and Tiguan, then the ID3 and ID4 are a bit like your posh cousins who always have the latest fashion and tech. You get a number of engine and battery options, with power outputs spanning 146hp to 295hp, and ranges starting at 213 miles and going up to 328 miles.  Rear-wheel-drive is standard with top specs getting all-wheel-drive. The ID4 is supposed to follow the look of the ID3 and like that car, it has slim LED headlights connected by a full-width LED light bar, while a large intake sits low on the bumper. You’ll spot that there’s no grille (electric cars don’t need them because they don’t have a hot engine to cool). Range: 317-337 miles Efficiency: 3.9-4.1 miles per kWh Battery size: 77kWh Max charge speed: 135kW / 175kW Charge time AC: 12hrs 40mins, 0-100% at 7kW Charge time DC: 28 mins, 10-80% at 135kW / 28 mins, 0-80% at 175kW Charge port location: Right rear Power outputs: 282hp / 335hp And that’s about it for the front-end highlights. At the back, a wide lightbar mimics the similar element of the front of the car. But with a high bonnet and bulbous back end, the ID4 is a bit blobby and heavy-looking. It has a simpler design inside, though. For a start, there’s no gear lever — rather, you simply twist a large knob behind the steering wheel, similar to that on a BMW i3 . However, the wheel obscures the switch, so you have to crane around the rim to see it. Speaking of that driver’s display, it gives you key information, such as speed and charge status, on a sharp display. For other functions, there’s a 10.0-inch infotainment system, or 12.0-inch on top trims. There are comparatively few buttons, because most functions are operated through the central screen. You can also use your voice to control the infotainment settings on the move, although as with many systems of this kind it can be glitchy. Interior quality isn’t great either – there are some scratchy plastics – but at least the ID4 is comfortable. There’s lots of adjustment for the driver’s seat and steering wheel so you should be able to find a good driving position. And there’s loads of space in the rear seat, so passengers in the back should be comfy too – even in the middle seat. As for boot space, the Volkswagen ID4 offers 543 litres — ever so slightly more than the 510 litres in the BMW iX3 ’s boot. To keep with the Volkswagen Tiguan comparison, the ID4 doesn’t quite match its 615 litres, but given the size of the batteries underneath the floor in the ID4 it’s a fair effort. If you're thinking about buying a Volkswagen ID4 then head over to our deals page to see how much you can save. We also have a number of used Volkswagen ID4s available at carwow, while you can look at other new Volkswagen deals through carwow as well.

https://www.carwow.co.uk/volkswagen/touareg,Volkswagen Touareg Review & Prices,"£71,390",6/10,"The Volkswagen Touareg may not have quite the badge cachet of the Audi Q7 and Mercedes GLE , but nevertheless, it’s a big, spacious, high-tech SUV that’s also very comfortable. Think of the Touareg, then, as Waitrose rather than Harrods Food Hall. It’s easily posh enough for the majority of people, but might not be plush enough for those used to the finer things in life. Volkswagen gave the Touareg a little nip and tuck in 2023, which introduced a new-look grille at the front, updated bumpers and a full-width rear light bar (which includes a questionable illuminated VW badge). It’s not as instantly recognisable as a Porsche Cayenne , but it’s inoffensively handsome. It’s a bit more impressive inside, with the central touchscreen that blends into a 15.0-inch digital driver’s display. The central screen is larger than anything you’ll find in an Audi , BMW , Mercedes or maybe even your local Vue cinema, and controls almost all of the VW’s features – from the sat nav to the climate control. This is all standard on post-2023 models. It’s not just high-tech, because the Touareg comes with a slick, sweeping cabin design that looks suitably upmarket, but a few cheap-feeling materials do let the Volkswagen down a bit, such as on the centre console and lower surfaces of the dashboard. Overall it’s a very plush place to sit, but for the price the likes of BMW and Audi do it better. The VW Touareg’s excellent practicality means you might be able to forgive a few scratchy pieces of plastic, however. There’s ample space for very tall adults in both the front and rear seats, and – besides the rather shallow tray under the armrest – all its cubby holes and storage bins are pretty generous. The ISOFIX anchor points are a doddle to access, too, and the large rear door openings make it easy to fit a bulky child seat. It’s not just spacious in the back seats, because the Volkswagen Touareg comes with a seriously big boot, too. With the back seats in place, there’s more room for a few sets of golf clubs or a large baby buggy than in anything else you might be considering – though the Audi Q7 and Mercedes GLE have a bit more room with the back seats folded. It’s a shame there’s no seven-seat option, though. There are five engine options, but VW’s 231hp 3.0-litre diesel engine fits the bill perfectly for most. This turbocharged V6 has plenty of grunt to pull heavy trailers or blast past slow-moving traffic. It’s impressively quiet around town and whispers along almost silently at motorway speeds, though company car buyers will be more tempted by the lower tax you get with the plug-in hybrids . Driving the Volkswagen Touareg is pretty relaxing – despite its daunting size. You get a good view out and the light steering makes squeezing through tight spaces as easy as in any large SUV . If you spend lots of time driving in town, the optional four-wheel steering is well worth considering – it helps make the VW Touareg even more manoeuvrable by altering the angle of both the front and rear wheels to help you turn as tightly as possible. The standard automatic gearbox changes gear smoothly and doesn’t jerk or stutter at slow speeds, though it can be a bit slow to respond when you put your foot down on the motorway, though the Touareg is incredibly quiet and comfortable when driving at higher speeds. And that’s where much of its appeal lies, coupled with the spacious cabin and boot. It’s just a shame that the Touareg is a similar price to posher alternatives such as the Audi Q7 and BMW X5. As a result, you’re going to want to head over to Carwow’s Volkswagen Touareg deals page to see how much you could save, or browse the latest used Touareg stock available from our network of trusted dealers. You can also check out other used Volkswagen models and if you want to sell your car online , Carwow can help with that, too."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/volkswagen/tayron,Volkswagen Tayron Review & Prices,"£40,130",9/10,"Much like Alan Partridge’s beloved extender dining table, the Volkswagen has hit its venerable Tiguan with the practicality stick, bestowing it with a bit more length to create the Tayron. The Tayron’s size puts it directly on par with the mechanically similar Skoda Kodiaq for practicality, but its posh interior and fancier design - especially on top-spec R-Line models - makes it a viable alternative to more premium cars such as the BMW X1 and Volvo XC40 . While the Volkswagen badge might not be quite as posh as brands such as Audi or Mercedes , at a first glance at least, the Tayron can certainly hold its own in terms of exterior design. The flat bonnet, tall roofline, boxy wheel arches and butch front end give the big Volkswagen buckets of road presence. There’s a similar story inside, where some minor changes compared to the Tiguan give the Tayron a much more upmarket feel. The dashboard is broken up by a big trim piece which swoops up around the vents at either end, and there are some snazzy ambient lights set into the dashboard and door trims. A 12.9-inch touchscreen infotainment system is standard with a 15.0-inch unit available on higher-spec models, but they’re both crisp and easy to read, as is the 10.3-inch driver display. The rotary knob in the middle of the centre console is rather less so, and it can be fiddly trying to select its individual menus. What isn’t fiddly, however, is finding the right driving position or somewhere to store your tat. The Tayron has comfortable seating all round, even in the third row, with lots of storage space in the front and loads of legroom in the middle row. The sliding bench helps when getting passengers in the rearmost seats. An enormous 885-litre boot (850-litres in seven-seater models) allows the Tayron to swallow up pretty much all the luggage you can throw at it. Naturally, boot space is limited with the rear seats up, but even then you’ve got as much load capacity as in a small hatchback . And the piece de resistance is that the Tayron is a bona fide seven-seater . Even with six-foot tall passengers in the second row there’s enough space for a similarly sized adult in the back, if only for short trips, and the wide cabin means you can fit three across the middle in relative comfort. You can have a Tayron with a multitude of engine choices, from a 1.5-litre mild-hybrid petrol engine to a 2.0-litre diesel , with a range of plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) and petrol engines in between. The entry level 1.5-litre engine is plenty to haul the Tayron about with little fuss, though it can sound a little strained getting up to motorway speeds. One of the 2.0-litre options will feel more effortless if you regularly carry a full car of passengers. Despite its heft and enormous footprint, the Tayron is surprisingly easy to drive around town. The steering is light without feeling vague, while big mirrors, a flat bonnet and a high seating position mean the big Volkswagen is easy to place on the road. R-line models do feel a bit stiff over broken road surfaces, though big bumps are well absorbed. Motorways are comfortable too, with a well-insulated engine keeping vibrations at bay and little in the way of wind noise, and while it’s not all that fun to drive the Tayron feels mostly grippy and planted on a country lane. As a big, practical, posh SUV the big Volkswagen makes an excellent choice of family car, and you can check out the latest Tayron deals here on Carwow, or Tayron lease deals instead. Alternatively, have a look at used Tayron deals through our network of trusted dealers, or other used Volkswagens if you don’t need all that junk in your car’s trunk. Carwow can even help you sell your car when the time comes."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/volkswagen/golf-gte,Volkswagen Golf GTE Review & Prices,"£40,140",Not found,"The Volkswagen Golf GTE is the plant-based vegan burger menu option of the hot-hatch world. You know it’s better for you and the planet, and it’s pretty much as tasty and filling, but you’d (not so) secretly rather be having the meat-fest beef burger that is the Golf GTI . There is a pretty good argument that the Golf GTE is the best of all worlds, but up till now it’s been slightly too much of a compromise. The first generation version used a 13kWh battery giving it a theoretical 40 mile range on electric energy alone (and that was broadly a realistic enough figure — certainly, you’d have got 30 miles out of it). Combined with a 1.4-litre turbo petrol engine, that gave you 242hp and 0-62mph in 6.7secs. Not as fast as a GTI (blame the extra weight of the battery) but still brisk, and you could easily get it to average better than 60mpg with only a little bit of charging. Even so, the Golf GTE always felt second best to the petrol-only GTI. The weight didn’t help — sapping the acceleration as it did — and the extra ride height needed to make enough clearance underneath the car for the battery mean that while the GTE was fine to drive, it could never be as sharp and rewarding as the GTI. Now, though, there’s a major update for the GTE. Out goes the wheezy old 1.4 turbo and in comes a more modern, smoother, slicker 1.5-litre TSI turbo petrol engine. The electric motor has been beefed up too, so now the GTE develops 272hp, actually slightly more than the upgraded GTi manages. Crucially, the GTE’s battery is now much bigger than before — 19kWh — and VW claims that gives it an electric range of more than 62 miles. In fact, given that the bigger, heavier Volkswagen Tiguan e-Hybrid also squeezes 62 miles out of the same battery, the Golf GTE should go a bit further than that, and that dramatically changes its ability as a zero-emissions driving option. Fast-charging comes to the Golf GTE for the first time too, as you’ll be able to use 50kW DC public chargers to top up the battery in around 20 minutes — and cause apoplexy in every electric car driver for a 1,000 mile radius. The combo of ultra-low CO2 figures and long electric range could actually make the GTE a better choice for business user-choosers than the petrol-only GTI, even if the advantage in the tax returns is lost in the corners. Inside, the awkward, cheap-looking infotainment screen originally introduced in 2019 has been chucked out and replaced by a slick new free-standing unit that gets software which is far easier to find your way around. VW is even going to stick Chat GPT artificial intelligence software into the screen later in 2024, allowing the car the chat to you like a proper robot companion. The GTE also gets traditional tartan seat centres, but the colours have been changed to grey and white to make them look a little more tech-y. Just remember that the big battery costs you boot space — you can only pack 275-litres into the back of a Golf GTE. We'll have an in-depth Volkswagen Golf GTE ready to go once we've tested it out thoroughly, but if you're already convinced the Golf GTE should be your next car, have a look through our latest Volkswagen deals and used Volkswagen cars for sale . You can even sell your car online through Carwow."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/volkswagen/id7-tourer,Volkswagen ID.7 Tourer Review & Prices,"£51,795",9/10,"Volkswagen has a long history of making great, large estate cars - the VW ID7 Tourer is the company’s latest, and in many ways one of its best. It’s a large, family-sized electric car , but being an estate instead of an SUV means it’s both better to drive and look at than VW’s own ID4 or ID5 models. Compared to those two cars, it’s like the annoying overachieving sibling - it’s handsomer, better at everything and should by all rights be the most popular. Yet the craze for SUVs means many buyers will look right past it, which is a shame. There are a few all-electric estate car alternatives to the ID7 Tourer, but they’re either a fair bit cheaper or much, much more expensive. In the former camp there’s the MG5 EV and above that, the closely-related Vauxhall Astra Sports Tourer Electric and Peugeot E-308 SW . On the other side, the BMW i5 Touring and Porsche Taycan Sport Turismo offer much more of a luxury experience - but with far more of a luxury price tag. Volkswagen ID7 Tourer: electric range, battery and charging data Range: 358 - 424 miles Efficiency: 4.1 - 4.9 mi/kWh Battery size: 77kWh/86kWh Max charge speed: 175kW/200kW Charge time AC: 11hrs 55m/12hrs 50m 0-100% Charge time DC: 30m 10-80% Charge port location: Right rear Power outputs: 286hp/340hp The ID7 Tourer looks great from the outside. It has a minimalist aesthetic, like Volkswagen’s other electric cars, and the design is dominated by a full-width lightbar at either end. The front one even incorporates a light-up Volkswagen logo, so that everyone knows what you’re driving even after dark. On the inside, practicality is a very strong point. Even when the front seats are all the way back, there’s room in the rear for a six-footer to get really comfortable - and thanks to the Tourer’s greater headroom compared to the ID7 hatch , they’ll have even more space. Meanwhile, the ID7 Tourer’s boot is larger than any other electric estate car on sale - it’s also bigger than VW’s own ID4 SUV. Interior quality is a step up compared to the other cars in the ID line-up. Everything feels nicely-built, but there’s still an over-reliance on screens over physical buttons. Other than a hazard warning switch, everything on the ID7’s interior is controlled through either the central touchscreen or the touch-sensitive steering wheel controls. It makes the ID7 quite difficult to recommend to anyone who isn’t a bit of a technophile - having the air-con controls through the screen is one thing, but using it to control the direction of the air vents is a step too far. The ID7 Tourer’s powertrain is tied to the trim level, and there are two battery sizes and two electric motors to choose from. Even the more basic Pro Match model can do over 300 miles on a charge, but if you opt for the Pro S Match version you get an official range of 424 miles - that’s one of the longest-range electric cars on sale. We’ll update this review with driving impressions once we’ve been behind the wheel. If you can’t wait until then, check out Carwow’s Volkswagen ID7 Tourer deals to get a great price. You can also browse used Volkswagen prices from our network of trusted dealers, and when the time comes to sell your current car , Carwow can help with that, too."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/volkswagen/touareg-r,Volkswagen Touareg R Review & Prices,"£82,950",6/10,"The Volkswagen Touareg R is the hottest version of the German manufacturer’s large SUV, the VW Touareg . It’s the most expensive Volkswagen you can buy - even beating out a fully-specced up ID Buzz - and as such, VW’s thrown the kitchen sink at it in terms of technology. If the regular Touareg is like an iPhone - posh, premium and feature-packed - then the Touareg R is like the iPhone Pro Max. Bigger, pricier, and stuffed full of even more tech, whether you actually need it or not. The ‘R’ badge is reserved for VW’s most powerful products - you’ll find it on the Golf , T-Roc SUV and Arteon fastback. But the Touareg R is the only one of these to be a plug-in hybrid - putting it into contention with a huge number of posh plug-in SUVs from the Porsche Cayenne E-Hybrid to the Volvo XC90 to our favourite, the BMW X5 50e . Inside, you wouldn’t know the Touareg was intended to be a sporty product. Though the ‘R’ badge is sprinkled liberally across the software and on the steering wheel, the Touareg R’s seats are large, comfortable and supportive, and the colour palette is a muted blue rather than the aggressive red of some more overtly macho offerings. It’s a really nice place to sit - Volkswagen hasn’t tried to squeeze a third row of seats in, so there’s palatial room for five and a big boot too. Up front, a 15-inch touchscreen infotainment system controls most of the car’s functions through a sensible and easy-to-operate interface. The same can’t be said for the touch-sensitive controls on the steering wheel, though. The Touareg R’s plug-in hybrid engine produces a beefy 462hp, good for the benchmark 0-62mph sprint in 5.1 seconds. That’s just 0.4 seconds behind what the Golf R can manage, making it highly impressive for such a large SUV. However, the Touareg’s sheer weight and size mean that it doesn’t feel very agile when you’re cornering. It’s more of a blunt instrument than a precision scalpel, and both the BMW X5 and Porsche Cayenne are much more satisfying to drive. The Touareg’s air suspension does mean it’s very comfortable over bumps, but that shouldn’t really be the defining feature on a car that’s badged as a special performance model. Compared to the X5 and Cayenne, the Touareg’s plug-in hybrid system is a bit lacking, too. It’ll only do an official 31 miles on a charge - compared with around 50 for the other two - and that means it’s less useful for lowering your fuel bills, and attracts higher rates of tax too. Considering the Touareg R is pricier than both of those cars, yet does without the attraction of a truly premium badge, you might find that a lower-tier Touareg suits you better. A plug-in hybrid is available on the lower variants, too - just with less power and without the sporty pretensions. But if a giant R-badged Touareg suits you, check out the best Volkswagen Touareg R deals right here on Carwow. You can also browse used Volkswagen Touaregs , or other used Volkswagens - and remember that when the time comes for car-changing, you can sell your car online through Carwow too."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/volkswagen/passat,Volkswagen Passat Review & Prices,"£39,840",8/10,"The Volkswagen Passat is back, and this time there’s no saloon option – you can only get it as a mega spacious estate . That’s no problem, though, because it has always stood out for being big, practical and not quite as expensive as other Passat alternatives such as the Audi A4 Avant , BMW 3 Series Touring and Mercedes C-Class Estate . (Though the Skoda Superb Estate is the real value wagon.) It’s a bit like buying designer gear from TK Maxx – you’re getting the same sort of quality as you would from a big name store, but you don’t feel quite as posh in the process. Not that the Passat looks like a cheap alternative. It’s always had an understated class, and that continues with the latest model – it’s perhaps not as elegant as its predecessor but it’s certainly smart enough. And if you go for the R-Line model you get a big, imposing grille up front to go with the smart full-width rear light bar that’s standard across the range. It’s inside where Volkswagen has really taken the Passat up a notch, though. There’s a massive infotainment display in the centre of the dashboard that runs Volkswagen’s latest software. It’s a big improvement on recent VW systems, even if it is a touch annoying having to do everything through the screen. Running behind this and into the digital instrument display is an illuminated panel that gives the Passat a cool modern look, particularly at night. Overall build quality and refinement are great, too. There’s buckets of space whether you’re sitting in the front or the back, and there’s loads of room for a child seat, though an SUV requires you to bend down less. With a boot capacity of 690 litres with all seats in place, or 1,920 litres if you fold the second row down, there’s huge luggage capacity and useful square space that makes it easy to load up. Despite the Passat’s popularity with long-distance drivers, there are no diesel engines anymore. There's a 1.5-litre petrol making 150hp, but company car buyers will be more tempted by one of the two plug-in hybrid options, because of the lower benefit-in-kind rate. Both offer an excellent electric range of up to 80 miles, as well as impressive charge speeds by hybrid standards. They are a great choice if you do a lot of city driving, because the long range means you can pootle around on electric power to keep fuel bills down, but whichever engine you go for the Passat is a refined and comfortable car to cruise around in. It’s at its best on the motorway, and while you do notice a few sharper bumps in the cabin, the car settles quickly. It’s not particularly sporty though, so a BMW 3 Series Touring will be better if you want to make the most of the occasional twisty road. Find out how much you can save by browsing the latest new Volkswagen Passat deals available on Carwow. You can also get a great price on a used Passat , or other used Volkswagen models, through our network of trusted dealers. And when it’s time to sell your car , Carwow can help with that, too."

Volkswagen has opened the order books on the all-new VW T-Roc R – a jacked-up small SUV with the high-performance heart of the Golf R . On the outside, this speedy SUV shares plenty with the standard VW T-Roc . It gets a similar chunky silhouette, chrome trims and a contrasting roof, but the front bumper has been given a helpful does of air intakes to help cool its much more powerful engine. Nip round the back – past a set of new 18-inch alloy wheels – and you’ll notice four large exhaust pipes, a new roof-mounted spoiler and a customary R badge on the boot lid. Inside, the changes are just as easy to spot. There’s a sporty steering wheel for starters, alongside a few carbon-fibre trims and some more supportive sports seats pinched from – you guessed it – the Golf R. Space in the back is unchanged from the standard VW T-Roc, so things are a bit cramped for three tall adults and there’s room in the boot for a few suitcases, but not too much else. More exciting than how much you can cram behind the seats, though, is what sits under the VW T-Roc R’s bonnet. Rather than the standard T-Roc’s most powerful 190hp 1.5-litre engine, this R model comes with a 300hp 2.0-litre unit that drives all four wheels through a seven-speed automatic gearbox. With the accelerator pinned and launch control engaged, this high-riding SUV will reach 60mph from rest in less than 4.9 seconds, making it a smidgen slower than the VW Golf R and Audi SQ2, but quicker than the Cupra Ateca . To make sure it isn’t just fast in a straight line, the VW T-Roc R also gets upgraded brakes, lowered suspension and a Race driving mode that tweaks the responsiveness of the accelerator and gearbox. Just the thing for nabbing that last parking spot on the school run… See how much you can save on your next new car by visiting our VW T-Roc R deals .

At a glance, this looks like a regular estate car, but it’s big, chunky and spacious like an SUV. It’s a bit like those Russian matryoshka dolls. The big ones look a lot like the small ones, but open them up and they can fit a lot more inside. Combining SUV and MPV practicality, the Jogger has been designed so that seven people can sit in comfort throughout – yes, even in the rearmost seats. That said, don’t expect to find a first-class cabin that’s all posh leather and wood panelling. The Jogger’s interior is simple and hard-wearing, and perhaps a bit cheap-feeling in places. But then this is an extremely affordable car , and when it comes to value for money, it hits the nail on the head. Where the Jogger really impresses is how roomy it is. You’d be hard-pressed to find more headroom in a cathedral, and there’s loads of space in the second row (and even the third row) for taller adults to stretch out comfortably. Of course, boot space takes a hit when you’ve got seven people in the car. But by folding down the rearmost seats – which are also easily removable – you’ll easily be able to fit more than a couple of chunky suitcases back there, even though those seats don’t fold flat into the floor. With its no-frills price tag, you get a pretty no-frills set of standard equipment at the entry-level. Air conditioning, metallic trim detailing and 16-inch steel wheels with covers are included, but to get an infotainment system you need to download an app onto your smartphone. But at least there’s a built-in smartphone cradle you can then use to hold your phone in place. Of course, if a properly spartan version of the Jogger isn’t really your bag, you can always upgrade. The range-topper doesn’t cost a huge amount more, and it gets things like heated seats, cruise control , LED headlights and a proper infotainment system. The mid-range specifications are a good compromise of keeping costs low without sacrificing some luxuries here and there. There are two engine choices, starting with a 1.0-litre petrol with 110hp that’s paired to a six-speed manual, and which can take you from 0-60mph in around 11 seconds. That’s enough punch when you’ve got one passenger on board, but with a full car you’ll likely find you struggle to make swift progress. Better is the hybrid version, which has a 1.6-litre petrol engine and an electric motor that make a more load-friendly 140hp. It’s still not rapid, but it’s more economical, and is the only way to get a Jogger with an automatic gearbox. Either way, the Jogger is comfortable. Sure, it might not be the sportiest or the most refined car in the world, but then again it’s not meant to be. The manual gear shift is smooth, and the Jogger doesn’t feel so chunky that squeezing into tight parking spaces will cause you to break out in a cold sweat. This is a very easy car to drive, and to see out of. On the motorway, it makes for a good cruiser too. Yes there’s a bit of wind noise, and yes, you’ll notice that the petrol version feels a touch underpowered. But otherwise, the Jogger makes for easy sailing. All up, the Dacia Jogger is an extremely likeable car. It’s cheap to run, supremely practical, comfortable and very charmingly simple to use and to live with. So if it sounds like it could be the car for you, head on over to our Dacia Jogger deals page to see how much you can save when you buy through Carwow. If you're interested in a used Dacia Jogger then you're in luck, head over to our used page to check out the latest offerings, or browse other used Dacia models.

https://www.carwow.co.uk/dacia/sandero-stepway,Dacia Sandero Stepway Review & Prices,"£16,015",8/10,"The Dacia Sandero Stepway is the jacked-up, slightly buffer cousin to the regular Dacia Sandero supermini. Stepway, in Dacia parlance, means a car has had a slight SUV makeover - it gets higher suspension, plastic cladding around the bumpers and wheelarches, and some outward-bound features such as roof bars. In the case of the Sandero Stepway, however, it doesn’t come with any real mechanical changes - despite appearances, there’s no four-wheel drive or off-road kit to get excited about. Think of the Stepway like a regular Sandero that’s done some situps - it looks beefier and more capable, even if it’s not really any more powerful. Superminis with faux-SUV makeovers had a spate of popularity a few years ago, but nowadays the Sandero Stepway is out on a bit of a limb. You might prefer to stake your claim on either side of the Sandero Stepway, and opt for either a normal supermini - such as the Renault Clio , the SEAT Ibiza or even the normal Dacia Sandero. Or, you could go the whole hog and opt for a proper small SUV - such as the Volkswagen T-Cross or Skoda Kamiq . Dacia remains a value brand at heart, and so even though the Sandero Stepway is the most expensive way to buy a new Sandero it remains one of the cheapest new cars in the UK. Despite this, it feels well built inside, and even though there’s an abundance of hard plastics there’s also a few concessions to style and comfort - such as a fabric strip across the dashboard to add some visual interest. It’s dead easy to find a comfy seating position, and all the controls are as straightforward and self-explanatory as you’ll find anywhere. If you’re upgrading to the Sandero Stepway from an older car, you won’t find anywhere near as steep a learning curve as you would in some of the competition’s touchscreen-heavy interiors. The Sandero Stepway drives a lot like an older car too, with heavier controls than many modern superminis. That does extend to the equipment list - while you’ll find all the essentials such as air-con, remote central locking and smartphone connectivity, Dacia hasn’t gone to great lengths to fit the latest safety equipment. While this may suit you if you don’t like the incessant beeping and interfering you get from some models, it contributes to one of the Sandero Stepway’s biggest downsides - a dire two-star Euro NCAP safety rating . Read into this further and it’s not quite so shocking, though. The Sandero scored the equivalent of four stars for occupant protection in a crash, but a car’s overall Euro NCAP star rating is dictated by its lowest category, where the absence of things like lane-keeping assist and pedestrian detection for the autonomous emergency braking pulled the result down. You’ll be able to make your own judgement, of course. But what this means is that while the Dacia Sandero Stepway isn’t fundamentally unsafe in a crash, there are safer small cars out there - ones that not only protect their occupants better but have technology to help avoid incident in the first place. If you’re interested, you can find the latest Dacia Sandero Stepway deals right here on Carwow. You could also look at the deals on a used Dacia Sandero Stepway here, as well as other used Dacias . And when the time comes to change your car, you can sell your car online through Carwow’s network of trusted dealers too."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/dacia/sandero,Dacia Sandero Review & Prices,"£14,715",8/10,"The Dacia Sandero is a budget small car alternative to the popular Ford Fiesta and Volkswagen Polo . It doesn’t meet those cars head-on in terms of tech or driver appeal, but rather looks to beat them on value for money. In fact, in its most basic guise, it’s one of the cheapest new cars on sale in Britain. For that reason, buying a Sandero has always been a bit like travelling on a Ryanair flight. Sure, you’ll wind up in the same destination at roughly the same time as you would on a British Airways plane, but your ticket will cost you a fraction of the price. Just like that in-flight sandwich, however, you’ll have to fork out if you want any extra toys on your Dacia. Chances are you’ll be willing to spend that money, too. As far as looks are concerned, you can no longer get the flat white paint and large black plastic bumpers that gave the car an is-it-finished-yet aesthetic. Now, there's just the Essential and Expression models – offered with body-coloured bumpers and more imaginative (optional) paint options – which help the Sandero look much smarter, helped by an update in 2022 that gave the car a new face. Just don’t expect to turn as many heads as you roll down the high street as you might in a Renault Clio . That said, the cabin has a surprising amount of wow-factor about it – at least it does on the range-topper. Sure, there are a lot of hard, scratchy plastics throughout and a few of the fixtures do feel cheap, but it’s by no means grim in here. Snazzy black and white fabric trim inserts really give the place a visual lift, and there are plenty of useful storage cubbies dotted throughout. The driving position is spot on too, thanks to good visibility, clear analogue dials and plenty of adjustability in the seat base and steering column. Backseat passengers won’t have much to grumble about when it comes to leg- and head-room either, and boot space is par for the course (although the likes of the Volkswagen Polo and Renault Clio both have more). It’ll also get you from A to B with no fuss or bother. Sure, the light steering can feel a bit vague at quicker speeds, but the Sandero is fine to drive and is easy to manoeuvre around town. It’s pretty comfortable, even on long drives, while wind and road noise is minimal on the motorway. There's a choice of two engines in the form of a 90hp petrol and a 100hp petrol/LPG bi-fuel version, both of which utilise a 1.0-litre engine and five-speed manual gearbox , returning about 53mpg (when running on petrol). If you would prefer an automatic, the more rugged Sandero Stepway has this option on its top-spec Extreme trim. This bells and whistles trim isn't available on the regular Sandero, but you do get creature comforts like a proper infotainment display with built-in sat nav, cruise control , automatic lights and wipers, a reversing camera and parking sensors, in Expression models. Of course, doing so will mean you have to pay (a bit) more money – just like you would if you wanted to bring more than a backpack with you on that Ryanair flight. Even so, for the way it drives and the practicality on offer, the Dacia Sandero still represents exceptional value for money. Being ‘cheap’ certainly isn’t a bad thing in this instance. If this sounds like your kind of car, you can browse the latest Dacia Sandero deals , or browse a large stock of used Sanderos from a network of trusted dealers. You can also take a look at other used Dacia models, and if you need to sell your car online , carwow can help with that too."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/dacia/bigster,Dacia Bigster Review & Prices,"£25,215",9/10,"This is the Dacia Bigster, and it’s fair to say it’s rather exciting. Visits to the Bigster’s Carwow news story in 2024 led to it being crowned Most Anticipated Car of 2025 , and now it’s here - and we’ve driven it. It’s a real case of meeting your heroes. The Bigster is the largest model in the Dacia range, as you might expect from the name. Sitting above the Duster , it’s an alternative to cars such as the Nissan Qashqai , Skoda Karoq , Hyundai Tucson , Ford Kuga and many others. The USP of the Bigster is its price tag. It starts from less than £25,000, and even a range-topping model is less than £30,000. This means that it’s priced similarly to much smaller SUVs , or it gives you a couple of choices - you could have the Dacia for the same price as a two-year-old Hyundai Tucson, or have a top-spec Bigster with all the equipment for the price of an entry-level SUV from another brand. Looking at the Bigster, it’s unmistakably a Dacia - it looks just like the Duster’s bigger sibling, with a similar blocky style. Y-shaped LED daytime running lights mirror the Dacia badge in the centre of the horizontal grille, and round the side there are chunky wheelarches and hidden rear door handles. All models come with alloy wheels and roof bars, reducing the impression that this is a budget SUV. That impression isn’t ruined once you get inside, either. It’s really neatly styled, with more Y-shaped details in things like the air vents. All models get a digital driver’s display along with a 10.1-inch touchscreen infotainment system, which look far more modern than you might expect from a cheap car . You soon see where the money’s been spent - or hasn’t - when you start poking around the interior, though, as it’s uniformly made of hard, cheap plastics. Some areas, such as the strip across the width of the dashboard, have genuinely quite a nasty texture, but they do feel pretty hardwearing. And you can’t argue with the space on offer. The Bigster is one of the larger cars in this class, and so gets a massive boot and space for six-foot adults to stretch out in the rear. There’s a choice of three engines with the Bigster. There are two mild hybrid offerings, one with two-wheel drive and one with four-wheel drive, as well as an all-new full hybrid engine with really impressive fuel economy. We’ve only driven this full hybrid model so far but were left very impressed, though refinement at a cruise can’t match the more premium alternatives available. If you like the look of this big, great-value SUV, then check out the latest Dacia Bigster deals on Carwow or see what Dacia Bigster leasing offers are available. You can check out other great Dacia deals , or find a used Dacia for sale . And remember that Carwow can even help you to sell your old car when the time comes."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/dacia/duster,Dacia Duster Review & Prices,"£19,380",9/10,"The Dacia Duster is a byword for practicality, value and toughness - and has been since the first-generation model launched in the UK in 2010. The second-generation car had more of the same but was a much nicer vehicle to live with day-to-day, and now the new third-generation Duster has upped the ante once more. It’s still as rugged and useful for family life as it ever was, but now has refreshed looks, an extra degree of sophistication and even the option of a hybrid engine for the first time. It's so good, and such fantastic value, that it's the winner of the Smart Spender category in the 2025 Carwow Car of the Year Awards . Its pumped-up styling makes it look like a high-tech walking boot for the road. And just like a walking boot, the Duster is ideally suited for rough terrain, as it’s part of a dwindling group of small SUVs available with four-wheel drive. Alternatives for the Duster are universally more expensive and less durable, but include small SUVs such as the Volkswagen T-Cross , Renault Captur and Peugeot 2008 . The 4x4 variant has even fewer models to do battle with, rivalling only the Jeep Renegade and Suzuki Ignis . Lots of the new styling touches are really practical. The plastic cladding along the front and sides should protect from errant trollies in supermarket car parks, with the material on the front and rear being the same colour all the way through - which means scratches and scrapes won’t show as much. Other plastics used on the exterior are made of a recycled material Dacia’s calling ‘Starkle’, keen to bolster the car’s eco-credentials. Inside, the new Duster is much more sophisticated than the old model. The entry-level car just comes with a phone mount in the centre, but the next trim up brings a touchscreen infotainment system with wireless smartphone connectivity. It also comes with a 7.0-inch digital dashboard display, making for a surprisingly slick and high-tech looking dashboard. Dacia’s value roots become obvious when you start poking around - you won’t find soft-touch plastics anywhere in the Duster’s interior. Everything feels hard wearing, though, and interesting textures mean it looks quite cool - we really like the rubber floor mats, which are designed to look like map contours. The robust surfaces should prove well up to the rigours of family life, or adventuring - they’ll withstand a lot of punishment, and wipe clean easily. It’s also really spacious for a small SUV, with space for six-foot adults in the rear and a big, square boot with some useful underfloor storage. The Duster’s transformation continues with the introduction of its first hybrid engine. It’s the same system as you’ll find in the Dacia Jogger hybrid , and it’s extremely efficient as well as being much smoother in town. Other engines available are a mild hybrid petrol, which will be available with four-wheel drive, and a lower-powered entry-level unit that can run on either petrol or cheaper LPG. It’s a shame that there’s no longer a hyper-economical diesel engine, but you’ll be able to forgive that when you feel how the new Duster drives. It feels much more reassuring than the old car with firmer suspension that doesn’t bounce you over bumps so much. Yet it’s still comfortable, and more capable off-road than almost anything else at this price point. Check out our best deals on the new Dacia Duster here. Or look at the rest of our favourite small SUVs to see the Duster’s main alternatives. You can see great deals on other Dacia models here, or buy a used Dacia here. And when you’ve chosen your new set of wheels, don’t forget you can sell your current car through Carwow too."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/dacia/spring,Dacia Spring Review & Prices,"£14,995",Not found,"Electric cars are really expensive, right? Well, Dacia doesn’t think so. The new Dacia Spring EV will cost less than £15,000 when it goes on sale later in 2024, making it the cheapest new electric car on sale by quite a margin. It’s one of the cheapest cars, full stop - even petrol-powered city cars such as the Toyota Aygo X cost more to buy. But does being the Poundland of EVs mean that you’ll end up with a car that’s actually no use to anyone? The Dacia Spring is sort of a halfway house between electric cars that aren’t really cars - like the Citroen Ami - and the cheapest versions of proper EVs, such as the Vauxhall Corsa Electric . Its closest alternative is the new Citroen e-C3 , which is the second-cheapest EV on sale (if you’re keeping track) but promises to be a more rounded product. The Spring EV is a tiny car, weighing less than a ton and around 30cm shorter than Dacia’s other small car, the Sandero. That means you only get four seats inside, though they’re surprisingly spacious for such a dinky car. You also get a 308-litre boot, which is bigger than a Vauxhall Corsa Electric’s 267 litres and almost the same size as a Citroen e-C3’s 310-litre space. Dacia Spring: electric range, battery and charging data Range: 140 miles Efficiency: 5.1mi/kWh Battery size: 27kWh Max charge speed: 30kW Charge time AC: 3hrs 50 mins, 7kW Charge time DC: 45 mins, 20-80% Charge port location: Front centre Power outputs: 45hp/65hp You can even tick the right options box to unlock 35 litres of ‘frunk’ space under the bonnet, making a useful spot to store charging cables and other supplies. The interior of the Spring is very much aiming for ‘cheap and cheerful’, with flashes of colour lifting the ambience and hopefully distracting you from the cheap materials. All models do get a 7.0-inch digital drivers display, and equipment for UK models is going to be surprisingly generous - with cruise control, air-con and remote locking as standard. Top-spec cars will also get a 10.0-inch infotainment screen with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Where you’ll really notice the cost-cutting is on the road. Dacia will offer two versions of the Spring in the UK, named the 45 and the 65. The former has a 45hp electric motor, a top speed of just 78mph and takes a yawning 19.1 seconds to get from 0-62mph. The 65 model has - you guessed it - 65hp, and manages 0-62mph in a much more palatable 13.7 seconds, which is on par with most petrol city cars. Being so light, the Spring makes the most out of its tiny 27kWh battery pack, with an official range of 137 miles per charge. That’s a modest amount, especially when you look at larger EVs that can do almost 300 miles - but it’s more than enough for even a fairly chunky daily commute, and for many people it’ll be plenty. Especially if the Spring is playing as a second car for a family that already has a combustion-engined vehicle for longer journeys. We’ll be getting behind the wheel of the Dacia Spring before it goes on sale to bring you our full verdict of what it’s like to drive and live with. In the meantime, though, you can check out what we think are the best cheap electric cars , or see how much you could save on a Dacia Spring or other Dacia models here. You can also take a look at used Dacias , or trust our network of dealers to help you sell your old car when the time comes."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/dacia/logan-mcv,Dacia Logan MCV Review and Prices,"£7,405",6/10,"The Dacia Logan MCV is a cheap small estate car that has a huge boot and can be bought with an impressively frugal diesel engine. It’s not the most comfortable family car on sale but it’s hard to argue with its bargain-basement price tag and practical interior. It’s not a particularly exciting car to look at, inside or out. Swathes of brittle black and grey plastics smother the Logan’s cabin, and although it’s as boring to look at as a braille picture book, its hard materials feel like they’ll withstand even the roughest treatment from kids. You’ll be better off avoiding entry-level Access models – they don’t even come with a stereo. Mid-range Ambiance models have a few more creature comforts but top-spec Laureate versions are the ones to go for. They sport a few softer trims in the cabin, come with a much more up-to-date seven-inch touchscreen infotainment system with satellite navigation and voice recognition as standard, and have air-conditioning. Getting comfortable is a little tricky if you’re anything but average height – only range-topping versions come with height adjustable seats and an adjustable steering wheel. You can’t get the Logan MCV with lumbar support to reduce backache on long drives either, but there’s loads of headroom in the front and space in the back is reasonably generous, too. Three adults will just about fit and there’s plenty of space for kids to get comfortable. The Logan MCV’s huge boot is what sets it apart from other cars in its price range – no other car that costs this little can carry as much stuff as the Logan MCV can in its practical, square load bay. It’s very nearly as roomy as the capacious Skoda Octavia but costs around £10,000 less. The Dacia can carry 573 litres of luggage with the rear seats in place – enough space for multiple suitcases. Fold the back seats down in a handy two-way (60:40) split and it grows to a massive 1,518 litres – easily big enough to carry a bike without removing its wheels. Buying a Dacia Logan MCV is like getting an Ikea wardrobe – it’s boxy, affordable and immensely practical but you can’t shake the feeling that it’s probably cheap for a reason… You can get the Logan with a choice of three petrol engines and one diesel. Pick the 0.9-litre turbo petrol if you spend most time pootling around town – it’s reasonably perky and will return around 45mpg. The 1.5-litre diesel is a better bet if you’re often on the motorway or regularly carry heavy loads. It has more pulling power than the petrol but will still return around 65mpg. On rough roads you’ll feel larger bumps through the Logan’s seats and it’s rather noisy at motorway speeds – so it’s not a relaxing car for long trips. Thankfully, its big windows make it pretty easy to park or thread through tight city streets. Euro NCAP awarded the Logan MCV a three-star safety rating in 2014. It won’t offer quite as much protection in a crash as some more modern cars but all MCV’s come with a selection of electronic systems that help you stay in control in slippery conditions. That said, the Logan MCV’s so cheap you can easily forgive the fact that it’s not all that well built and isn’t particularly relaxing to drive. It’s one of the few roomy cars you can buy for the money and well worth considering if you prefer practicality to a premium feel."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/dacia/logan-mcv-stepway,Dacia Logan MCV Stepway Review and Prices,"£12,370",5/10,"On paper, the Dacia Logan Stepway comes with a very generous supply of safety features, including Hill Start Assist – which keeps the footbrake applied as you move your foot to the gas pedal – cruise control, rear parking sensors, a speed limiter, and driver, passenger and side airbags. There’s also an emergency brake assist system that automatically slows the car if you’re on your way to having a low-speed crash. The infotainment system is comprised of a 7.0-inch touchscreen display, which has a DAB digital radio, built-in satnav and Apple CarPlay/Android Auto compatibility as standard. That’s an impressive list of equipment, then – you’d need to buy a top-of-the-range Tipo to compete with that, which starts from £19,850. There may only be one trim available for the Stepway, but the features you get with it rival a top-of-the-range Tipo. Despite there only being a single variant of the Logan MCV Stepway, the car has two engine options: a 0.9-litre, 90hp petrol and a 1.5-litre, 95hp diesel. Both engines are economical, but the latter is a better bet if you’re frequently driving on the motorway, where it will return better fuel economy. That said, the petrol is marginally quicker from 0 to 62mph (12.4 seconds versus the diesel’s 12.6). We’re yet to drive the Dacia Logan MCV Stepway, but we’ll have driving impressions for you just as soon as we have."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/fiat/tipo-station-wagon,Fiat Tipo Station Wagon Review & Prices,"£10,149",5/10,"The Fiat Tipo Station Wagon is a more spacious alternative to the standard Tipo hatchback . It doesn’t look or feel as special as the Ford Focus Estate or Vauxhall Astra Sports Tourer , but it is roomy, practical and costs less to buy than those alternatives. The standard Fiat Tipo is one of the more forgettable hatchbacks on sale, and the Station Wagon’s boxier back end does little to improve things. High-spec cars get a few shiny chrome trims below the windows and around the grille, but neither these – nor the metal C-shaped frames around the foglights – are quite enough to make the Tipo Station Wagon stand out . Step inside, and this slightly bland theme continues. Sure, the Fiat Tipo Station Wagon’s interior is neatly laid out and all the heating controls are easy to use, but none of the materials feels quite as nice as in the Vauxhall and Ford and you can’t spice things up with any brightly coloured trims like in the smaller Fiat 500 hatchback . The Fiat Tipo Station Wagon’s infotainment display isn’t much to shout about either. All but the most basic models get a 5-inch screen but it doesn’t look as smart as the Ford’s unit and isn’t particularly intuitive to use. The Fiat Tipo Station Wagon comes with height-adjustable front seats as standard so there’s plenty of space for you to get comfy. There’s enough room in the back for two adults or three kids to stretch out, but the Ford Focus Estate has significantly more knee room and its central seat doesn’t feel quite as cramped. It’s a similar story when you come to load the Fiat Tipo Station Wagon’s boot. There’s space for a few suitcases or a baby buggy, but the Ford Focus Estate and VW Golf Estate are roomier still. Flip the back seats down and there’s space to slide a bike into the Tipo Station Wagon’s flat load bay, however, and you get a few storage trays either side to stop smaller items rolling about. If you plan to regularly fill your Tipo Station Wagon’s boot and head to the tip, pick a 1.6-litre diesel engine. It’s not quite as smooth as the diesel engines you can get in alternatives but it won’t cost a great deal to run – especially if you do a lot of motorway miles. If you prefer pottering around town to lapping up long journeys, pick one of the two 1.4-litre petrol engines instead. Unfortunately, the Fiat Tipo Station Wagon’s six-speed manual gearbox feels a little notchy to use and the optional automatic unit doesn’t change down with any great urgency when you want to accelerate hard to overtake slow-moving traffic. You’ll hear more wind and tyre noise at speed in the Fiat Tipo Station Wagon than in the Vauxhall Astra Sports Tourer and Ford Focus Estate and you can’t get it with as many advanced safety features, either. That being said, the Fiat Tipo Station Wagon will set you back significantly less than these cars, so it makes a good option if you’re looking for a spacious small car on a fairly tight budget. Check out our latest Fiat deals and our used Fiats for sale to see how much you can save on one, and do also see how you can sell your car online through carwow ."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/fiat/500,Fiat 500 Review & Prices,"£17,995",6/10,"The Fiat 500 is perfectly suited to short urban commutes or popping into town. In the same way you wouldn’t wear a miniskirt and heels for climbing Mount Snowdon, and you wouldn’t wear tweeds and brogues to the beach, you wouldn’t buy a 500 for long cross-country schleps. The compact city car is something of a dying breed, but if you’re shopping for a Fiat 500 then you could also consider the Toyota Aygo X , Kia Picanto or the Renault Clio . The little Fiat has all these cars beaten on the style front though, offering a unique splash of retro chic. Things get even funkier inside, where the body-coloured dashboard and optional white steering wheel help lift the ambience nicely. The seats themselves aren’t the comfiest, but there’s plenty of adjustment to help you get a good view out and all the controls are grouped sensibly together so they’re a doddle to use. That said, the Fiat 500’s 7.0-inch touchscreen infotainment system takes a bit of getting used to thanks to the fiddly menus, but you can always use the standard-fit Apple CarPlay or Android Auto instead. Sadly, there isn’t much you can do about the Fiat 500’s cramped seats. Two adults in the front will be fine, but anyone close to six-feet tall will struggle for knee- and headroom in the back, and there isn’t a great deal of space in the Fiat 500’s boot for everyone’s luggage. You probably won’t be packing the Fiat 500 with loads of bulky baggage though, will you? More likely you’ll be doing the school run, heading to work or popping to the shops. In these respects, it does a great job. Kids will have no trouble jumping into the back and the Fiat 500’s small size makes it just the thing for nipping through traffic and squeezing into tight parking spaces. Its 1.0-litre mild hybrid petrol engine is best suited to town driving as well, and it’s pretty economical. The great all-round visibility and light steering also help to make light work of tight car parks. Sure, it isn’t the most comfortable small car out there and it’s a bit noisy at speed, but it’ll tackle a twisty country road without much body lean and all models come with cruise control to help make the occasional motorway journey a bit more bearable. It’s just a shame that you can’t get the Fiat 500 with automatic emergency braking. However, you shouldn’t let this put you off if you’re looking for a seriously stylish city car that’s cheap to run, easy to drive and comes with plenty of personalisation options.

The 500X was launched in 2014 and – to help it keep pace with the SEAT and Citroen – got a facelift in 2018. Changes included an updated interior, a new infotainment system, extra safety kit and a couple of new petrol engines. The diesels from the old model have been dropped. In terms of exterior styling, only the lights have changed – you now get new daytime running lights and rear LEDs – so you’ll struggle to tell the difference between the old car and this 2018 model. You can also choose from two exterior (rather optimistically coined) ‘body styles’ – Urban Look, which has conventional body coloured bumpers or Cross Look which has chunkier bumpers with mock skid plates. The interior gets the same retro look as the outside, the large swathe of body-coloured plastic that runs across the dashboard gives the 500X a playful feel that’s missing from the dingy SEAT Arona . But, while the 2018 500X gets a new instrument binnacle and a new steering wheel, its interior plastics look cheap in places, particularly in the back, and its switches and buttons are a little flimsy. The infotainment system has also been updated but doesn’t have the clear graphics or ease of use you get in the SEAT’s system. You do, however, get Apple CarPlay and Android Auto as standard in the Fiat, so it is easy to use your smartphone’s apps on the car’s 7.0-inch screen. Up front, there’s plenty of space to get comfy even if you’re tall and someone of a similar size should be able to squeeze behind you, too. The Fiat has a slightly smaller boot than its aforementioned alternatives, but it is easy to load and has space for a couple of large suitcases. Filled to the brim with people and stuff, the 500X’s otherwise nippy 120hp petrol engine isn’t going to feel quick, but it’s still the engine to go for because the quicker 150hp 1.3-litre model’s standard automatic gearbox is frustratingly slow to change which blunts acceleration. It’s a shame the more powerful engine is spoiled because there’s not much wrong with the way the 500X drives. In town, you can zip in and out of gaps in traffic, while at faster speeds there’s not too much body lean to worry about and the Fiat’s weighty steering makes it easy to place in bends. On the motorway, the suspension smooths out bumps better than it does at slower speeds, although the cabin does suffer from a fair amount of wind noise.

The 500L itself is actually based on the Fiat Punto, and is aimed at customers who find the idea of a 500 appealing, but need more space. The 500L looks like a Fiat 500 with a pie addiction It’s certainly a practical choice, but reviews are mixed when it comes to deciding whether it’s worth the money or not."

https://www.carwow.co.uk/fiat/500-convertible,Fiat 500 Electric Convertible Review & Prices,"£31,035",6/10,"If you want to buy an electric car but don’t want to give up the glamour of good looks and an open roof, then the Fiat 500 Electric Convertible is one of very few options available to you. Based on the regular Fiat 500 Electric hatchback, but with a fabric roof that opens back past the rear window, it’s one of just three electric convertible cars you can buy in 2025 - joining the MG Cyberster and the Maserati GranCabrio Folgore. If the regular 500 Electric is a glittery shoe, then the Convertible model is the open-toed version. Unlike the MG or Maserati, it’s not a ‘full’ convertible as the doors and roof rails stay in place - but it’s still a great way to get the wind in your hair without sacrificing much everyday usability. The more natural alternative to the 500 Electric are other small electric cars, such as the Mini Cooper Electric or Peugeot E-208 . Styling-wise, there’s little to separate the Convertible from its hatchback sibling. In fact, from the front, there are no changes at all - the only difference is the Convertible’s fabric roof and its smaller boot opening. You still get the same retro-cool styling, with a minimalist look and a rounded silhouette. You also get a selection of eye-catching colours, ranging from a bright acid green more suited to the Abarth 500e to classy metallic pale blue or rose gold. With lots of shiny chrome trim, the 500 Electric Convertible is a real jewellery box of a car. Range: 185 miles Efficiency: 4.4mi/kWh Battery size: 42kWh Max charge speed: 85kW Charge time AC: 6hrs 0 - 100% Charge time DC: 30 mins 10 - 80% Charge port location: Right rear Power output: 118hp And just like a jewellery box, there’s not much room inside for anything bigger than a necklace. As with the 500 Electric hatchback, while the front seats are reasonably accommodating for adults, the rear seats are suitable only for the smallest of children. Interior storage is also pretty poor while the boot is a minuscule 185 litres accessed through a tiny rear hatch. But a convertible car isn’t really about practicality, it’s about the experience. The 500 Electric Convertible’s roof has two positions - one where it acts like a big sunroof, and another where it rolls back over the rear window to give a real open-air feeling. While it’s not as bracing as a proper convertible, it’s still a great way to get the wind in your hair, and is actually fantastic in terms of refinement and wind intrusion - you could happily have the roof fully open on the motorway and still have a conversation with someone inside. There’s just one battery and motor combination for the 500 Electric Convertible, which provides a maximum of 185 miles of range and a weak-sounding 118hp. In reality, performance is ample, with a zippy feel around town and more than enough grunt to tackle the occasional faster road. However, the tiny battery pack and relatively slow charging mean that repeated longer journeys in the 500 Electric Convertible are best avoided. Head on over to our best Fiat 500 Electric Convertible deals to see how much you could save, or see our other best Fiat deals here. You can check out used Fiats for sale here, and remember that when the time does come to change your car Carwow can even help you sell your old one through our network of trusted dealers."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/fiat/panda,Fiat Panda Review & Prices,"£14,995",4/10,"It might not have the retro looks of the Fiat 500 , but the Panda is stylish. Its upright body means there’s plenty of room inside and all models come with five doors for great access. Interior quality might not be up to the standards of a Volkswagen Up , but it’s fair to say that Fiat has harnessed a decent amount of charm. The Panda feels at its best in the city, where its small dimensions make it perfect for weaving through congested streets and squeezing into tight parking spaces. Small engines mean the Panda is also cheap to run, but not best-suited to fast-moving motorway traffic, where it can feel a little out of breath. There are two body styles available. The first is the regular Panda, which is available on the base trim and looks like a typical city car. You also have the Cross, which can be found on the three other trims, called Red, Garmin and Top. This has some extra body cladding and other rugged-looking features that give it some baby off-roader style. Pandas are cheap cars, which means standard equipment is pretty basic and includes items such as central locking, six airbags, a CD player and power steering that can be lightened at the touch of a button. Overall, the Fiat Panda is a charming and well-sorted small car that has plenty of appealing traits. The space on offer is quite impressive for such tiny dimensions, it’s cheap to buy and run and is abundant in style and character. There are a few rough edges here and there, and rivals such as the Kia Picanto and Volkswagen Up are very tempting alternatives to the funky Fiat. However, the Panda has a lot going for it, and is a much more capable all-rounder than the alternatives. It’s definitely worth considering if you’re in the market for such a car, so why not check out our Fiat Panda deals to see how much you could save? Or you could find a great deal on a used Fiat Panda from our network of trusted dealers, as well as browsing other used Fiats . When the time comes to sell your car , carwow can help with that, too."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/fiat/qubo,Fiat Qubo Review and Prices,Not found,4/10,"The Fiat Qubo is a small MPV with a roomy interior and a very practical boot. If you’re searching for a bigger alternative to a small hatchback and don’t fancy an SUV, this funky-looking, boxy car could be the answer. If the Fiat Qubo will likely remind you of a small van with windows, that’ll be because it uses plenty of the same mechanical bits and bobs as the Italian firm’s smallest commercial vehicle. As a result, it doesn’t have quite the same street-cred as an equally tall and boxy SUV, but you won’t have any trouble finding it in a crowded supermarket car park. The Fiat Qubo’s interior carries on the theme set out by its boxy exterior. The dashboard is pretty plain, save for a few silver plastic panels, but at least the knobs for the heating and the buttons for the stereo are easy to reach. It doesn’t feel as plush or as solid as many similarly priced hatchbacks, however, and you can’t add any colour to the Qubo’s pretty drab interior with any posher trims or colourful inserts. Almost every surface feels hard and brittle too, but at least you get a rubber floor as standard which is a doddle to keep clean. This form-over-function approach runs right the way through the Fiat Qubo’s cabin. There are acres of headroom, the front doors open nice and wide and the back doors slide rather than swing open so it’s easy for passengers to climb in – even in tight parking spaces. If you’re looking for an unashamedly practical box on wheels, the budget-minded Fiat Qubo makes a good choice. Just don’t expect it to win any admiring glances… Once inside, they’ll find there’s loads of legroom to stretch out – even if they’re tall and sit behind a six-foot driver. The three back seats are all equally wide so you can carry three adults at once without anyone fighting over who has to sit in the middle seat. If no-one’s tagging along for the ride you can flip the back seats forward and use the Fiat Qubo to carry absolutely masses of luggage. The boot’s wide and square and comes without any kind of load lip so it’s dead easy to slide in some heavy furniture. You can even fold the front passenger seat forward to carry really long items. With the back seats in place, the Qubo can carry about the same amount as a small family hatchback such as the Skoda Fabia. Speaking of which, the Fiat Qubo feels remarkably like a conventional hatchback to drive – despite its boxy shape and tall body. Sure, you’d never call it fun, but it irons out bumps reasonably well around town and doesn’t lean excessively on twisty roads. You can get the Fiat Qubo with one petrol and one diesel engine. Neither are particularly gutsy, but the latter’s your best bet if you spend any length of time on the motorway while the petrol will suit inner-city drivers better. You can’t get the Qubo with any particularly clever safety feature like you can in most small hatchbacks or SUVs, but when it comes to outright load-carrying ability, this quirky van-based MPV offers decent value for money. Check out our Fiat Qubo deals to see how much you can save on one."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/fiat/500c,Fiat 500C Review & Prices,"£4,495",6/10,"Inspired by ‘La Dolce Vita’ of warm days in Tuscany or Rome, the Fiat 500C is a convertible small car that has a sliding soft-top and wonderfully retro styling. With only the Mini Convertible and Toyota Aygo X (when it's fitted with a sliding roof) the only true alternatives, the 500C is part of a rare breed – but it’s not going the way of the dodo just yet, with the 500 Electric Convertible taking up the zero-emission mantle. Its style is classic Fiat, with plenty of chrome trim around the main badge and lights matching the throwback looks. The short overhangs, which make it great in town, are matched with more chrome around the back, which has rectangular lights and shows the full extent of the sliding roof. Inside, most of the dashboard features a body-coloured panel to match the outside. That hosts the 7.0-inch touchscreen, the climate controls and a high-mounted gear lever. The steering wheel sits in front of the speedometer, which has the rev counter inside it as well as a small driver information display, which isn’t easy to navigate. Top versions get a 7.0-inch screen behind the wheel, although that isn’t the simplest to use either. You won’t find a lot of cabin space in the 500C. Yes, the driver can get comfortable fairly easily, but if you’re tall you won’t find masses of headroom available. Trying to squeeze adults into the back is very tricky, as you have to fold the front seat forward, then clamber into a space where you’ll find little room. The boot isn’t particularly large either. At 185 litres, it seriously lags behind the boot in the Mini Convertible and Toyota Aygo X, while multiple other small cars top that if you’re not desperate for the sliding roof. Folding the back seats down does open more space, but the boot opening itself is too narrow to fit larger items in. You only get one engine choice with the 500C – a 70hp 1.0-litre three-cylinder petrol engine with a small generator and battery applied to help with fuel economy. That comes with a six-speed manual transmission. The sprint from 0-60mph is more of a jog, taking 13.8 seconds. In town, the keenly revving engine helps you get up to urban speeds quickly enough, while the light steering can be made even lighter by pressing a button on the centre console to make the Fiat more manoeuvrable. The 500C is comfortable enough over bumps and you get a good view around you, but the rear view can be hindered with the roof rolled down. That tiny engine does start to run out of puff when you’re on the motorway though. As it takes so long to get up to speed, you have to make the most out of every gear by revving it close to the red line. It is also quite noisy at higher speeds, with wind and road noise glaringly obvious. If you’re in an Abarth 695C – a tricked-out Fiat 500 – twisty roads are a lot of fun. Not so much in the Fiat 500C. You feel like you might topple over if you take a corner too quickly, and the steering does not give you a great sense of how much grip your front tyres have. While the Fiat 500C offers a lot for those wanting to enjoy sunnier weather when driving around town, there are sacrifices that need to be made –. it’s not that practical for its size and isn’t refined when you need to go on a longer journey, with a Mini Convertible or Toyota Aygo X being more accomplished overall. If you want to see the best new deals on a Fiat 500C , check out carwow, where you can find used FIat 500C offers as well. You can look into other used Fiats here, and if you want to change your car the easy way, you can sell your car through carwow where our trusted dealers will get you the best price."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/fiat/tipo,Fiat Tipo Review & Prices,"£4,790",4/10,"The Fiat Tipo is available with a choice of two petrol and two diesel engines in five different power outputs. The entry-level 1.3-litre diesel model comes with a five-speed manual gearbox while larger engines benefit from a six-speed manual. A six-speed automatic gearbox is offered on 1.6-litre petrol and diesel cars and Fiat has announced a dual-clutch version will be available in the near future. Its interior is a departure from the retro-inspired Fiat 500 range and focuses instead on basic functionality and occupant comfort. The rear seats have an impressive amount of legroom and the tall rear roofline provides decent headroom. As a result, three six-foot tall passengers can sit in the back for shorter journeys. Standard equipment on entry-level cars might disappoint some customers although a seven-inch touchscreen infotainment system with Apple CarPlay , Android Auto and sat nav is available on higher-spec models. The 440-litre boot is more spacious than those in the Nissan Pulsar (350 litres) and Renault Megane (384 litres) but lags behind the Skoda Octavia's capacious 600-litre load bay. The rear seat bases can be flipped forward allowing the seat backs to be folded completely flat and the lack of discernible load lip makes loading heavy or bulky items easy, too. The Fiat Tipo does a good job of blending cheap running costs with impressive practicality and a reasonably refined ride in a distinctive and sharply-styled package. The selection of engines on offer might be sparing, but two efficient diesels and a number of rev-happy petrols should mean there’s a Tipo to suit the needs of most potential customers.

https://www.carwow.co.uk/fiat/600,Fiat 600 Review & Prices,"£25,105",7/10,"The Fiat 600 is a bit like a designer handbag you buy because of its stylish looks, but when you get it home you find you can barely fit anything inside. That’s because while the 600’s retro-inspired looks will certainly turn heads, alternatives are much more spacious. And there are alternatives aplenty, from the chic Renault Captur to the rugged Dacia Duster , smart Volkswagen T-Cross and ultra-efficient Toyota Yaris Cross . You could even consider the bigger, plug-in hybrid MG HS , which isn’t a great leap in price. Yet while most of those cars look good in their own way, none is quite as funky as the 600. Sure, it’s not as effortlessly cool as the smaller Fiat 500 , but it’s not a bad effort and wears its curves well. That curvy theme continues inside, with a large oval dashboard that, on the base trim, is painted the same shade as the exterior, which works particularly well if you opt for one of the brighter colours. However, there are cheap materials aplenty, and the floppy cover for the central storage bin is just… odd. Space is pretty good for those in the front though, with plenty of places to store bits and bobs, but that’s where the practicality ends. The rear seats are tight and the boot, at 385 litres is smaller than most alternatives offer. The Captur offers up to a massive 616 litres if you slide the rear seats forward. The infotainment system has sharp enough graphics, but navigating its menus and finding various settings is unintuitive. You can at least bypass most of this with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto , which come as standard – and you’ll need to in the base model, because there’s no built-in navigation. Although Fiat markets the 600 engine as a ‘hybrid’, neither of the two engine choices are a proper self-charging or plug-in unit, so you won’t be cruising around town on electric power watching your MPGs skyrocket. However, it’s very effective at engaging electricity at lower speeds or when decelerating, so it’s relatively efficient – 50mpg is achievable – and smooth to drive around town. If all-electric motoring appeals you might consider the Fiat 600e instead. The diminutive footprint might not be great for space but it does mean the 600 is a doddle to drive in the city, particularly if you’re stepping up from the smaller 500. The suspension handles bumps well even at higher speeds, meaning motorway trips are nothing to fear. It’s anything but exciting to drive, though. Although it’s pretty good value for money already, find out how much you could save with Carwow’s Fiat 600 deals , or check out Fiat 600 leasing deals . You can also browse used Fiat 600s or other used Fiats from our network of trusted dealers, and when it’s time to sell your current car , Carwow can help with that, too."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/fiat/500l-mpw,Fiat 500L MPW Review and Prices,"£11,130",5/10,"The Fiat 500L MPW is a much more practical, but not quite as cute-looking, version of the Italian brand’s retro 500 supermini. Unlike the standard 500L, you can choose to have the larger 500L MPW fitted with an extra row of seats in the boot to let you carry seven people. In this respect, it’s similar to the Citroen Grand C4 SpaceTourer and Renault Grand Scenic – all are roomier seven-seat alternatives of existing family MPVs. Unfortunately for the Fiat 500L MPW, its bulbous balloon-like looks aren’t a patch on the futuristic Citroen or the comparatively slinky Renault. At least it’ll stand out in a crowded car park, though – if not for particularly favourable reasons. Thankfully, things improve when you look at the Fiat 500L MPWs interior. It might not be quite as funky as the Grand C4 SpaceTourer inside, but the 500L MPW’s retro white dials, metal-effect air vents and colourful glossy plastic trims make it look much more interesting than the rather drab cabin in a Grand Scenic. Sure, there are a few hard plastics dotted about the place, most noticeably lower down on the doors and dashboard, but the Fiat 500L MPW feels rugged enough to stand up to the rigours of the school run. The Fiat 500L MPW’s infotainment system’s small screen, clunky menus and low-rent graphics do let the side down a bit, though. You won’t have any trouble getting comfy in the 500L MPW’s front seats if you’re very tall and the middle row is roomy enough for three adults to sit side-by-side – if not quite as comfortably as in the Renault and Citroen. You might want to consider the Fiat 500L MPW over the standard 500L if you regularly carry large luggage or a few extra young passengers. Sadly, the optional third row of seats in the boot is much more cramped. There’s space for two kids, but even small adults will find their knees pushing uncomfortably into the seats in front. At least the back seats are easy to access using levers that flip the middle row forward, and the Fiat 500L MPW’s large windows mean none of your passengers will feel claustrophobic or car-sick on long drives. There’s barely any space left in the boot with the rearmost seats occupied, but fold them forward and you’ve plenty of space for a baby buggy and some suitcases. You can also fold down the middle row if you need to carry something large like a bike or some flat-pack furniture. Navigating the Fiat 500L MPW through crowded car parks with plenty of luggage in tow is a doddle. The steering is very light and the large windows give you a great view out. The Fiat’s suspension does a reasonable job smoothing out bumps around town and its tall body doesn’t lean a great deal on twisty country roads, either. The Fiat 500L MPW’s 1.4-litre petrol engine is a good choice if you take in a mix of motorway and town driving, but one of the 1.3-litre and 1.6-litre diesel units will be more suitable if you do lots of long journeys. You can also get the 1.3-litre model with an automatic gearbox to save you making numerous gearchanges in heavy traffic – just don’t expect it to feel particularly spritely when you accelerate hard. Cruise control comes as standard across the 500L MPW range, but only high-spec Trekking models come with automatic emergency braking. Despite this, if you’re looking for a practical MPV with space in the very back for an occasional sixth and seventh passenger, the Fiat 500L MPW is worth considering. Check out our Fiat 500L MPW deals to see how much you can save on one."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/fiat/124-spider,Fiat 124 Spider Review and Prices,"£21,390",7/10,"The Fiat 124 Spider is basically a Mazda MX-5 in a sharp Italian suit. The two cars were developed alongside each other and – along with the Abarth 124 Spider, which is also based on the same platform – are effectively your only options if you want an affordable two-seat sports car. However, if you were happy to spend a bit more, you might also consider the Audi TT Roadster or Mercedes SLC. Among the biggest differences between the Mazda and the Fiat is the way they look, with Fiat deciding to ape the classic Fiat 124 Sport Spider that was first produced back in the 1960s. So, instead of the Mazda’s more edgy lines, the Fiat has a more rounded, curvy look. The 124 interior design has been copied almost exactly from the MX-5. So, you sit nice and low – as you should in a sports car – and there are plenty of sporty touches to be enjoyed, such as gazing down the long bonnet and taking in the fact that each dial is in its own individually housing. If you go for a higher-end model, you get a 7-inch display that sprouts from the top of the dashboard, just like in the Mazda. The Fiat also follows the Mazda, in that there’s plenty of space inside for a couple of adults, too. Getting a comfortable driving position should be simple unless you’re over six feet tall. And, what few changes there are bring welcome improvements. For example, the Fiat has more soft-touch plastics dotted around, while the classy trim pieces give the 124 Spider a more premium feel. As you can probably imagine, boot space is not the 124’s forte, although it will take 140 litres. That’s 10 litres more than in the Mazda and enough for a couple of soft bags, but not a lot else. Where you will notice a bit more difference is in how the two cars drive. Not only does the Fiat have a different engine – Mazda’s non-turbocharged 1.5-litre petrol unit has been replaced by a turbocharged 1.4-litre – Fiat has also fettled the steering, suspension and brakes. Together, these give the 124 its own unique character, so that it has the more comfortable feel of a small grand tourer. As it has some extra pulling power from its turbocharged engine, the Fiat makes a very effective cruiser. It doesn’t need (or want) to be revved hard to get the best performance and there’s enough power to overtake without having to frantically change down a gear. Then again, that’s not a chore, because the gearbox is slick. Clearly, Fiat has taken to heart that line about ‘If you can’t beat them, join them’. There’s no better way to make a great sports car than to start with the Mazda MX-5. On more open roads, the engine’s healthy torque levels make it easier to kick the back end out on long sweeping corners. However, the car is not quite as fun to drive flat out as you might expect, because the steering has marginally less feel than the Mazda’s set-up and could be quicker to turn the wheels. The suspension strikes a good balance between remaining comfortable even on poorly surfaced roads and being able to tackle corners with gusto. Essentially, the 124 Spider is only a little softer than the MX-5 and it’s still a finely balanced rear-wheel drive car that keen drivers will love. Yes, you can feel some vibrations through the body and steering wheel – as you can on many convertibles – but not in a way that detracts heavily from the drive. While the 124’s engine gives it a laid back character, it’s hard to argue with a 0-62mph time of 7.5 seconds, making the basic Fiat a quicker sprinter than the entry-level Mazda MX-5. However, if you’re pressing on down your favourite country back road, the news isn’t all golden. A chief complaint is that the engine has little interest in revving. At lower speeds, it struggles until the turbo comes on song, while at the top end, the power tails off long before you reach the rev limiter. Keep it working in the mid-range and all is well, but this is not a plucky little sports car that loves to be thrashed. And, although there’s a nice burble from the twin exhausts at low speeds, the rest of the time it sounds ordinary – even somewhat strained at higher revs. That idea that the 124 is more of a grand tourer is reflected in the car’s standard equipment. It covers all the basics, including cruise control, air conditioning and 16-inch alloy wheels, but Lusso is arguably the trim to go for, with 17-inch alloys, a leather interior, climate control and rear parking sensors. For all the similarities with the MX-5, the 124 offers something a little different. From its more conservative styling to its torquey engine and softer suspension, it’s a more relaxing car than the MX-5 was ever meant to be."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/fiat/500-electric,Fiat 500e Review & Prices,"£25,035",7/10,"This is the Fiat 500e, a city car with lovable retro-chic looks and an all-electric motor and battery – it's a bit like Greta Thunberg, because it's small and eco friendly. The 500e is a bit bigger and heavier than the petrol 500 that's also still on sale, but it still has diddy dimensions. If you're looking for a small EV there aren't many to choose from – but the Vauxhall Corsa Electric , BYD Dolphin and Peugeot e-208 are all great choices. Rather than add a bunch of fiddly details to the outside, Fiat’s gone back to basics and made the 500 look smoother, more rounded and even more minimalist than before. It’s like your grandad suddenly ditching the dyed comb-over and shaving his head instead. Smoother, simpler, cooler. For starters, the old car’s headlights have been ditched in favour of two semi-circular lamps with curved daytime-running lights that shine out through the bonnet. The flush door handles and hidden indicators are pretty much the only difference you’ll spot from the side, and the lack of an exhaust pipe is a dead giveaway that you’re looking at the new car from behind. OK, so the new Fiat 500e looks pretty similar to the old car on the outside, but it’s a totally different story inside. There’s a brand-new 7.0-inch digital dial display instead of traditional dials, and you get a big 10.25-inch touchscreen on the dashboard with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone mirroring. The physical controls for the heating and air conditioning are grouped together under the central touchscreen and there’s a storage tray where you’d find a gear lever in a petrol- or diesel-powered car. Space in the front is good for two adults and there are decent storage options, but the back seats cater for two only, and they’ll have to be quite small people at that. Fitting a child seat is pretty much impossible, too, while the 500’s boot is good for the weekly shop, but not much else. It is a city car , after all. The Fiat 500e comes with two battery options – one that offers a 115-mile range and another with a 199-mile range, which isn't great when each of the other alternatives can go comfortably more than 200 miles in official tests. You can recharge your 500 using a three-pin socket, but that’ll take all night – literally. You’ll be better off getting a wallbox to take advantage of AC charging up to 11kW (or 7.4kW if that's the maximum you can get at your house), which will charge the battery in under three hours. The quickest way to charge is using a public fast charger , with the Fiat 500 capable of taking up to 85kW. At these speeds it can go from empty to 80% charged in 35 minutes, and add a useful 30 miles of charge in just five minutes. The Fiat 500 comes with either a 95hp motor that can hustle it from 0-62mph in 9.5 seconds, or a 118hp electric motor with enough poke to accelerate it from 0-62mph in nine seconds. That doesn’t sound particularly fast but the new 500 will do 0-30mph in three seconds, which is nippy in town and faster than most small city cars. Also handy in town is the new 500’s automatic emergency braking that’ll spot pedestrians and cyclists in your path and automatically apply the brakes if it thinks you’re about to hit them. That’s in addition to adaptive cruise control that’ll accelerate and brake for you on motorways to keep you a safe distance from the car ahead. There are three driving modes, Normal, Range and Sherpa. Range mode uses the motor to recharge the batteries when you brake to help boost the Fiat 500’s range, while Normal model tones down this ‘regenerative braking’ effect. The Sherpa function limits the 500’s top speed to 50mph (down from 93mph) and turns off the air conditioning. These extreme measures will be useful in an emergency when you really need to eke out every last mile to reach a charging point. So, the Fiat 500 is now an electric city car, but we think you’ll agree it’s a good one, provided you don’t need lots of space or expect the last word in interior quality. If you just love the looks, head to our Fiat 500e deals page . If you'd like a used Fiat 500 then head over to our used 500e deals .

https://www.carwow.co.uk/fiat/600e,Fiat 600e Review & Prices,"£29,035",7/10,"The Fiat 500e is a great city car, but what if you need a bit more space? Step forward the Fiat 600e - the Italian firm’s small, fully-electric SUV . It captures some of the charm and style that’s made the 500 so popular, but stretches it across a bigger body with much more interior room and - importantly - five doors. Think of it like the 500’s older sibling. It’s not quite as cute to look at as the baby of the family, and might not get as much attention - but it’s a lot more useful when you need a helping hand. The 600e may be bigger than the 500 but it’s still pretty small by SUV standards. Compared with alternatives such as the Peugeot e-2008 , MG ZS EV or Carwow Car of the Year-winning Volvo EX30 , it’s quite a bit smaller. It’s more like a jacked-up hatchback, having a similar footprint but higher roofline than cars such as the Vauxhall Corsa Electric . Those tiny dimensions mean the 600e is fantastic for driving and parking in cramped towns and cities, and if you’re upgrading from a 500 it won’t feel intimidating or too bulky. Despite this, interior space is pretty good. The front seats have loads of room, and while the back seats are a bit too cramped for adults to get very comfortable they’re plenty spacious enough for a couple of child seats. Fiat 600e: electric range, battery and charging data Range: 254 miles Efficiency: 4.7mi/kWh Battery size: 54kWh Max charge speed: 100kW Charge time AC: 7hrs 45 mins, 7kW Charge time DC: 27 mins, 20-80%, 100kW Charge port location: Rear left Power outputs: 154hp You do pay for that with the boot space, however, which at 360 litres is larger than most electric hatchbacks but smaller than just about every other comparable electric SUV. Inside, there’s quite a lot to like. The 600e shares many of its components with its close sibling, the Jeep Avenger Electric , but adds in a dose of Italian style familiar to those who’ve sat in a 500. There’s a swooping shape to the dashboard and some shiny trim, plus a pleasing round housing over the instrument cluster. It’s quite a trim-dependent interior, though, with posh La Prima cars getting light-coloured upholstery and trim that really lifts the cabin - while the darker trim of entry-level cars looks and feels a little cheap. There’s plenty of storage space with big door bins and adjustable cupholders, but the fabric flap that covers the central storage bin is just plain annoying. The infotainment system is Fiat’s latest, and it’s based on a very wide but quite shallow display. It can be a bit awkward to use, and a little jerky to flick between menus - but the screen itself is high-res and the wireless smartphone connectivity works perfectly well, allowing you to bypass Fiat’s own system if you want to. There’s also a nice set of physical climate controls, which is much easier to operate on the move than having to head into a display sub-menu just to adjust the temperature. On the road, the 600e is genuinely impressive especially considering its price. It soaks up bumps as well as any of its alternatives, and can make some much more expensive cars feel positively uncomfortable in comparison. Dealing effortlessly with speed bumps and bad roads, plus super-light steering and good visibility means the Fiat 600e is a fantastic EV to drive around town. It’s comfortable on longer trips, too, though it doesn’t feel quite as stable and tied down as some alternatives and there’s a bit more noise on the motorway. The 600e is available with just one motor and battery option at the moment. It officially offers 254 miles of range from a pretty modest battery capacity, and in our tests it proved impressively efficient - resulting in a real-world range of about 200 miles. Public charging from 20-80% takes less than half an hour, which is par for the course. If you’re not ready to make the switch to electric just yet, there's also a hybrid 600. So the Fiat 600e is a decent small electric SUV overall – it’s a bit cheap inside and not hugely practical, but it’s packed full of character and is comfortable to drive around town. It’s priced temptingly, too. Interested? Check out the latest Fiat 600e deals available through Carwow.

https://www.carwow.co.uk/fiat/500x-dolcevita-hatchback,Fiat 500X Dolcevita Hatchback Review & Prices,"£32,855",5/10,"In Italian, ‘dolce vita’ means to live the good life. In the case of the Fiat 500X Dolcevita, though, it means your retro-inspired SUV has a retractable roof. In the world of word association it’s quite the leap, but what’s in a name, really? You could compare the Fiat 500X Dolcevita to sipping espresso on the sun terrace of a cafe, because it’s cool, Italian and if the weather’s nice, more enjoyable if you can be exposed to the sunny sky. Convertible SUVs are a rare breed, with the much derided Range Rover Evoque Convertible and, more recently, the Volkswagen T-Roc Cabriolet scarce examples. But unlike these, the 500X Dolcevita has a retractable canvas roof that’s more like a big sunroof than a proper drop-top. While that sounds like a diss, the upside is that you don’t get the awkward proportions of the cars mentioned above. Instead, the design of the regular 500X remains as an alternative to regular family SUVs such as the Mini Countryman , Skoda Kamiq and Peugeot 2008 . The 500X is almost a decade old now, and its styling is heavily inspired by the small Fiat 500 city car that first reappeared in 2007. Yet it somehow still looks fresh and fun. While early versions of the 500X struggled to wrap the design cues over the bigger, chunkier body, Fiat has largely figured the details out to make this a pretty good looking SUV. You’ll find a similar funky chic style inside. It’s a playful appearance that offers something very different to some of the duller alternatives, such as the Kamiq or SEAT Arona , though it doesn’t feel quite as well built as those. The 7.0-inch touchscreen is one of the smaller units you’ll find in a family SUV, while it’s not hard to find some cheaper plastics."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/fiat/panda-4x4,Fiat Panda 4x4 Review and Prices,"£15,435",7/10,"The Fiat Panda 4×4 is a compact city car that’ll take the odd off-road excursion in its stride. It’s just as easy to live with as the standard Panda but comes with a grippy four-wheel-drive system that makes it a worthy alternative to the likes of the Suzuki Jimny and Dacia Duster 4×4. Inside, however, the Fiat Panda 4×4 comes with a much more stylish cabin than the unapologetically basic Suzuki. The dials, heating controls and even the centre of the steering wheel come with a squared-off circular design (should that be squircular?) and you can choose from a selection of camouflage olive, beige and brown trims for the dashboard. Less worthy of praise, however, is the Fiat Panda 4×4’s infotainment system. Rather than a slick touchscreen like you get as standard in many other small SUVs (including the Suzuki Jimny) you’ll have to make do with a back-to-basics stereo and CD player with an old-fashioned orange and black display. Fiat’s UConnect app lets you use some of your smartphone’s features while you’re driving, but it’s nowhere near as intuitive as the more commonplace Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone mirroring systems you’ll find in many alternatives. So, the Fiat Panda 4×4 doesn’t have a particularly high-tech cabin, but at least it’s relatively spacious for such a small car. Its tall body means there’s enough headroom in both the front and rear seats for adults to get comfy, but those in the back will be left wishing there was slightly more leg room – especially on long journeys. It’s a similar story when you take a look at the Fiat Panda 4×4’s boot. Its 225-litre capacity is big enough for a weekly shop but significantly smaller than the space you get in the likes of the less off-road focussed SEAT Arona and Renault Captur. Unlike most so-called off-roaders, the Fiat Panda 4x4 is perfectly capable of hauling you and three friends over deeply rutted fields and up snowy hills without breaking a sweat Also smaller than in many alternatives is the Fiat Panda 4×4’s diminutive 0.9-litre petrol engine. It might only have two cylinders, but it packs a fairly decent 85hp punch so it doesn’t feel too sluggish. It’ll accelerate from 0-62mph in a reasonable 12.1sec, and Fiat claims it’ll return 57.6mpg – although you’ll probably see a figure closer to 45mpg in normal driving conditions. There’s also a 1.3-litre diesel you should consider if you do lots of motorway miles. It’s not as fast as the petrol, but it uses less fuel and it’s slightly quieter when you’re cruising along. Not that the Fiat Panda 4×4 feels particularly at home whizzing along at 70mph, that is. It’s much more adept nipping through town where its small size and relatively large windows make it a doddle to manoeuvre and easier to park than the larger Dacia Duster. The Fiat Panda 4×4 is pretty comfortable to drive over poorly maintained roads, too, and it doesn’t lean a great deal in tight corners – despite its jacked-up suspension that makes it taller than the standard Panda. Head off-road, and the Fiat Panda 4×4’s special tyres and four-wheel drive mean it’ll happily traipse through mud that’d leave most two-wheel-drive SUVs well and truly stuck. It doesn’t have quite the same boulder-traversing abilities as the Suzuki Jimny, but it’ll prove more than capable of dealing with a few inches of snow or a heavily rutted field. Unfortunately, the Fiat Panda 4×4 there is a fly in the ointment The Panda Cross – with which the 4×4 shares many components – earned a mediocre three-star safety rating when it was crash-tested by Euro NCAP in 2015. If, however, you’re looking for a cheap, cheerful 4×4 that won’t cost the earth to run you should still consider the Fiat Panda 4×4 – especially if you actually plan to use it off-road."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/fiat/panda-cross,Fiat Panda Cross Review & Prices,"£9,295",7/10,"The Fiat Panda Cross is a chunky little hatchback that could be your ideal compact off-roader if you fancy something small and easy to drive but live somewhere prone to bouts of harsh winter weather. Unlike the Suzuki Jimny , the Fiat Panda Cross isn’t a thoroughbred 4×4 – as its name suggests, it’s based on the humble Panda hatchback . Peel away the Cross’ angrier bodywork, however, and you’ll find a neat four-wheel-drive system that means it’ll keep up with the Suzuki long after many more expensive SUVs have got themselves well and truly stuck. Its huge plastic bumpers and silver door protectors aren’t just for show, either – they’ll help make sure the Fiat Panda Cross’ bodywork springs back into shape should you have an altercation with a particularly solid piece of the countryside. It even comes with two tow hooks front and back so you can use the Panda’s off-road prowess to rescue other motorists caught in a sudden snowstorm – if you feel like it, that is. This rugged utilitarian theme continues in the Fiat Panda Cross’ cabin – only here it’s less appealing. Sure, the square instruments look pretty funky and the contrasting silver slab and copper-effect dashboard add a splash of colour, but the plastics all feel hard and scratchy and you don’t get a great deal of equipment as standard. So, it might not feel all that plush inside, but at least the Fiat Panda Cross’ cabin is pretty roomy. There’s loads of headroom in the front (although a height-adjustable driver’s seat doesn’t come as standard on entry-level cars) and three kids will have plenty of space to stretch out in the back. A Dacia Duster as more space for tall adults, though, as well as a more practical boot than the diminutive Fiat Panda Cross. The Dacia ’s engines aren’t quite as economical as the Fiat’s, though. You can get the Panda Cross with either a city-friendly 0.9-litre two-cylinder petrol or a more powerful 1.2-litre four-cylinder that’ll be better if you plan on doing long motorway journeys or any kind of serious off-roading. If you plan to stick to the asphalt, though, you’ll find the Fiat Panda Cross feels very similar to the standard Panda – that’s to say it’s a doddle to manoeuvre in town, easy to park and even reasonably comfortable. It’s not particularly spritely – whichever engine you pick – and it leans a fair amount in tight corners, though not enough to make passengers feel ill. What it lacks, though, is any kind of advanced safety kit, such as the automatic emergency braking feature you get in a Suzuki Jimny. That being said, the more affordable Fiat is still a charming compact off-roader that’s well worth a second look.

https://www.carwow.co.uk/renault/grand-scenic,Renault Grand Scenic Review and Prices,"£24,085",7/10,"The Renault Grand Scenic is a large family MPV that combines the practicality of seven seats with wild styling that helps it stand out from the likes of the VW Sharan and SEAT Alhambra. Take the Renault’s standard 20-inch alloy wheels for example. They’re larger than the wheels you’ll find on some Aston Martins and look like they’ve been pinched from some kind of sci-fi concept car. You could say the same about the strange kink in the Renault Grand Scenic’s side windows – although this serves a practical purpose letting small children see out and stopping them feel car sick on long drives. Less exciting is how the Renault Grand Scenic looks inside. If its exterior could make a convincing Star Wars prop, its cabin looks like it belongs on the set of Gone with the Wind. Almost everything’s either black or very dark grey and you’ll have to pay for a high-spec model if you want any kind of leather trim or mood lighting. Even the menus on the portrait infotainment system are a bit dark and dingy, but at least this touchscreen is relatively easy to use – if not quite as intuitive as the VW’s system with its extra menu shortcut buttons. You won’t buy a big seven-seater just because its cabin looks nice, though – rather you’ll be persuaded to part with your cash if it’s easy to live with. In this respect, the Renault Grand Scenic’s clever sliding seats and roomy cabin grant it plenty of brownie points. There’s space for three adults in the middle row and just about enough space for two more in the back – although, a VW Sharan is a bit more spacious still. The Renault Grand Scenic is a spacious seven-seater that could be your ideal MPV if how a car looks is just as important as how easy it is to live with. The VW also has a bigger boot than the Renault Grand Scenic, but both are huge once you fold all the back seats down. Even with the boot filled to the brim, the Renault Grand Scenic’s engines have enough poke to pull you along quite happily. The diesel version’s nice and quiet on motorways and is impressively economical. If you do lots of short journeys, especially in town, the petrol engine’s a better bet. The Renault Grand Scenic’s big windows and raised driving position also help make it feel at home in cities. The steering’s nice and light to help you manoeuvre it easily and you get parking sensors as standard, but the Renault’s huge wheels highlight bumps and potholes more than the smaller wheels you get on the VW and SEAT. That being said, the Renault Grand Scenic’s still pretty relaxing to drive – especially if you pay extra for the optional automatic gearbox. It’s not the smoothest unit around but it saves you from having to constantly change gear in heavy traffic. It also comes with automatic emergency braking and lane departure warning which help make the Renault Grand Scenic one of the safest MPVs on sale and certainly worth considering if you’re on the hunt for a safe and stylish family car. Check out our Renault Grand Scenic deals to see how much you can save on one."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/renault/megane-rs,Renault Megane R.S. Review and Prices,"£30,315",6/10,"The Renault Megane R.S. is a seriously quick hot hatch which, like the Hyundai i30N, the VW Golf GTI and the Honda Civic Type R, comes with front, instead of four-wheel drive. Unlike the Honda, though, the Renault Megane R.S doesn’t look like a collection of boy-racer cliches haphazardly fixed to a hum-drum hatchback. Sure, it’s wider and lower than the standard Megane, but compared with the Batmobile-inspired Civic, the R.S.’ fake plastic grilles, central exhaust pipe and big wheels are almost subtle. Almost. Things do get a little bit lairy inside, where you’ll find uber-supportive sports seats, red details on the steering wheel and dashboard and even optional carbon-fibre effect fabric inserts on the dashboard and doors. They’re an acquired taste, but help make the Megane R.S.’ interior feel undeniably sporty. There’s the same slightly fiddly portrait infotainment screen and digital driver’s display as you get in the standard Megane, only here you’ll find a few tasty R.S. graphics and a less appetising engine revving sound which plays through the speakers when you unlock and open the door. The rest of the Renault Megane R.S.’ interior is less gimmicky. There’s space for four adults to get comfortable inside, or two adults in the front and three kids in the back. It’s easy to fit a child seat because every model has front and back doors as standard, and the boot’s just as roomy as the standard Megane’s so there’s space for some suitcases, the weekly shop or a large baby buggy. There aren’t many ways to personalise your Renault Megane R.S., but you can pick between the standard 280hp version in standard or Cup trim, and a 300hp model with the upgraded Trophy chassis. The most hard-core Trophy versions of the Renault Megane R.S. may be the fastest, but they’re also the most difficult to live with thanks to their super-firm suspension. This slightly confusing arrangement boils down to a choice of three cars. There’s an entry-level 280hp car with softer, less focussed suspension, a more hard-core 280hp model with upgraded suspension and a grip-boosting differential and a rip-roaring 300hp range-topper with the beefiest brakes, biggest wheels and stiffest suspension. All models come with a 1.8-litre turbocharged engine and the option of a six-speed manual or an automatic gearbox. The automatic ‘box is responsive but a little jerky at slow speeds, while the manual is more engaging, but a bit notchy – especially when you’re barrelling along a country road. Another thing that feels odd at first is the Renault Megan R.S.’ four-wheel steering feature. This helps make it as agile as a mosquito after a double espresso – especially in the sportiest Race driving mode – but also makes the steering feel flighty and the car prone to wandering at motorway speeds. Around town, the firm suspension transmits an unpleasant thud through your seat with every passing pothole and you’ll hear a distinct roar from the wide tyres at motorway speeds. This all contributes to making the Renault Megane R.S. quite tiring to drive for long periods. If you’re hoping this firm setup results in racing-car handling on an empty backroad, you might be a little disappointed. Sure, the Renault Megane R.S. is one of the most nimble hot-hatches around, but its aggressively quick steering and fidgety suspension don’t inspire a great deal of confidence – especially on uneven or unfamiliar roads. Even the hard-as-nails Civic Type R in its most focussed R+ mode is more at home leaping from one bend to another than the perennially unsettled R.S. If you plan to take your next hot hatch on regular track days, then the Renault Megane R.S. is well worth a look – especially in its most focussed Cup and Trophy configurations. But, if you plan to take it to work as well as the race track, you’ll be better off with the Civic Type R."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/renault/rafale,Renault Rafale Review & Prices,"£38,195",7/10,"The Renault Rafale is what happens when high-street brands start producing their own takes on designer fashion trends; looks great but it just isn't as posh as the bigger names. Think of it as a Weekday outfit to the Gucci BMW X4 and Hugo Boss Volvo EC40 . Yet for its size and body shape it’s not a direct alternative to either of those cars, sitting somewhere in between the Germans and the cheaper Peugeot 3008 or less stylish - and electric-only - Skoda Enyaq Coupe . It’s not just in its positioning where the Rafale stands out, but in its styling too. It’s a head-turning car, with a tall, imposing front end, flanked by a pair of arrow-shaped LED running lights. The broad grille, aggressive headlights, sporty silhouette and sleek rear-end all give the Rafale a hint of baby Lamborghini Urus about it, if you squint. The interior is rather posh at a glance, but once you settle in, it’s not as luxurious as appearances suggest. The two-tier dashboard has a full-width vent detail across the passenger side and a driver-facing, portrait-oriented infotainment system . It’s mounted in the same wrap-around, driver-facing trim panel as the digital instrument cluster - and while it looks great, the gloss black detailing and air vents feel a bit cheap to the touch. The leatherette and suede on the seats, dashboard and door trims feel lovely though, and most of the high-up plastics are of the soft-touch variety. Boot space is good, and while the plug-in hybrid model loses out on some boot space, the regular model has more boot capacity than a Peugeot 408 and Cupra Formentor . The parcel shelf feels flimsy, and the seats don’t fold completely flat either, which is annoying. You can choose from a 200hp self-charging hybrid powertrain or a more powerful, 300hp plug-in hybrid (PHEV), both with the same 1.2-litre engine under the bonnet. The more powerful engine suits the car’s character better, and it’s a great choice for company car buyers due to its low benefit-in-kind tax rate . Driving the Rafale is a mixed bag, because while the optional four-wheel steering and responsive controls make for good progress in town, it’s far too stiff over small bumps - and bouncy over big ones. The same applies to ruts and dips on the motorway, and the road noise is far too intrusive at speed. Country lanes are better, as the darty steering, lack of body lean and tremendous levels of grip from its huge tyres are all reassuring when hustling down a back road. It’s just a shame that the steering wheel doesn’t give you much sense as to what the front wheels are doing, and the 1.2-litre engine is gruff when accelerating. As a sporty, alternative choice to the typical German or Scandinavian fare, the Rafale is worth a look, and you can find new Renault Rafale deals on Carwow. There are Renault Rafale lease deals too, as well as used Renault Rafales available through our network of trusted dealers. For something a little smaller, there are other used Renaults for sale, and Carwow can even help you sell your car when it’s time to switch."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/renault/koleos,Renault Koleos Review and Prices,"£28,380",6/10,"The Renault Koleos SUV is basically the same underneath as the Nissan X-Trail. However, unlike the Nissan, which has the option of seven seats, the Renault comes only as a five-seater, making it an alternative to the Skoda Kodiaq, Ford Kuga and Honda CR-V. Unsurprisingly, the Koleos looks very like Renault’s other SUV, the smaller Kadjar, at the front, but with plenty of smarter trim and chrome to reflect its position higher in the company’s range. It’s a sensation that is continued inside, where the standard sunroof makes the cabin feel nice and airy. It’s all very smart, too, and the Koleos gets Renault’s R-LINK 2 infotainment system in either seven-inch landscape form or with an 8.7-inch portrait display. The latter comes as standard on top-of-the-range models and it’s pretty to look and simple to use, although you’ll sometimes find its directions hard to follow and it’s frustrating that you have to use it to make minor adjustments to the ventilation system. Interior quality is a mixed bag, too. Although there is stitched leather on the centre console’s grab handles, as well as shiny chrome trim pieces, the plastics look and feel cheaper than you would get in a Skoda Kodiaq. What’s not open to criticism is how much space there is inside the Koleos. As Renault hasn’t had to make room for a third row of seats, all five passengers are treated to acres of head and legroom. The small hump in the floor and wide rear seats means that, even with three in the back, everyone should be happy. The seats are all comfortable and, thanks to the wide range of adjustment on the driver’s seat and steering wheel, pretty much anyone can get a good driving position. Perhaps the biggest reason for choosing the Renault Koleos over the Kadjar is the size of the boot. Even with all five seats upright, the boot will take the best part of 600 litres, which is more than enough for most families. Drop the rear seats and you have almost 2,000 litres to play with. All very impressive… I just don’t get it. Why doesn’t Renault sell a Koleos with seven seats, like the Nissan X-Trail? With only five seats, this is just a bigger, more expensive Kadjar – and, if I was picking between the two, I’d always choose the cheaper car. With that in mind, it’s no surprise that the Koleos feels like a large car to drive, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing. Unless you’re in town, you’ll only feel the worst bumps, while it’s nice and quiet inside the cabin, even at high speeds. The suspension feels quite soft, as you would expect, but the body lean is reasonably well contained unless you’re cornering very quickly. Overall, though, a Skoda Kodiaq feels sharper to drive. There are just two engines to choose from – both diesel – and the more powerful 177hp 2.0-litre model comes as standard with four-wheel drive, a combination that actually makes the Koleos pretty handy off-road. Alternatively, to make life on-road a little easier, the same engine can also be specified with a CVT automatic gearbox that shifts smoothly and doesn’t cause the annoying drone you get in other gearboxes of this type. Overall, though, unless you want four-wheel drive or an automatic, the 130hp 1.6-litre diesel feels pretty much as quick as the more powerful engine in everyday use and should return close to 50mpg if driven carefully. For most people, it’ll be the best engine to choose, especially as it’s the cheaper option in a range that looks quite expensive. On the other hand, there is some justification for the high price, as the car comes with lots of equipment as standard. That includes a full-length glass roof, sat-nav, part-leather seats, ambient lighting and cup holders that can heat or cool drinks. Last, but not least, the car also scored a full five stars in Euro NCAP safety tests, which is just what any parent will want to see in a family car. Overall, the Koleos is worth considering if you want an extremely comfortable SUV with a big boot, but don’t need seven seats. Its off-road ability and generous standard equipment are further attractions, but some of the alternatives feel better built, are more fun to drive and give you the option to specify seven seats."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/renault/scenic-e-tech,Renault Scenic E-Tech Review & Prices,"£37,195",7/10,"The Renault Scenic has been resurrected, and this time it’s ditched the dowdy MPV body in favour of being a chic, modern electric SUV . It’s a bit like when Zac Efron dropped his floppy-haired Disney kid look in favour of the gym-obsessed heartthrob appearance he has today. And chic the Scenic must be to stand out, because there are dozens of similarly sized electric SUVs vying for a spot on your shopping list, such as the Skoda Elroq , Hyundai Ioniq 5 and Peugeot E-3008 . There’s also the excellent Kia EV3 , which is a bit smaller and cheaper, but well worth considering. The quick win goes to the Renault Scenic, because it really does look good. At the rear you get chunky tail lights that drop down at the sides and make the car look really wide, as well as a simple but effective bumper design. Up front there are slim headlights and a fake grille with a cool gradient effect. Range: 260 miles - 379 miles Efficiency: 3.6 - 3.7mi/kWh Battery size: 60kWh / 87kWh Max charge speed: 130kW / 150kW Charge time AC: 9hrs 51mins, 0-100, 7.4kW / 13hrs, 0-100%, 7.4kW Charge time DC: 32mins, 15-80%, 130kW / 37mins, 15-80%, 150kW Charge port location: Right side front Power outputs: 170hp / 220hp The interior isn’t as immediately striking as the exterior, but it has a simple but smart appearance and there are some nice colours and materials for the upholstery, while the infotainment system is slick and easy to use. However, there are plenty of cheap materials to be found. Fortunately this is made up for with practicality, because there’s loads of storage in the cabin, plenty of adjustability in the front seats and steering wheel, and a huge amount of space in the back that also makes it good for a child seat. The boot is a good size too – at 545 litres it’s bigger than most alternatives, including the Skoda Elroq. There’s no front boot like you get in the Hyundai Ioniq 5, either. It might be practical, but out on the road, the Renault Scenic is a touch disappointing to drive. It’s generally quite comfortable, but it can be a bit jiggly over bumps, particularly at lower speeds. Visibility isn’t great either, and the spongy brakes take some getting used to. Now, it’s not so bad in any of these areas that the Scenic is not worth considering, it just doesn’t really stand out in any area either. For day-to-day comfort, the Hyundai Ioniq 5 is tough to beat. There are two battery and motor combinations, with the entry level version offering a respectable range of 260 miles, while the larger (more expensive) battery can go up to 379 miles between charges, according to official figures – that makes it one of the longest-range electric cars on sale.

The Megane is similar in size to the Hyundai i30, Kia Ceed and Ford Focus, but also shares a lot of parts with the Renault Kadjar SUV. The Renault Megane’s interior looks simpler than in most alternatives so most of the buttons are easy to locate. High-spec models also get a portrait-style infotainment system, similar to what you’d find in more expensive Volvo cars. The rest of the cabin is well put together and has some silver accents to break up the otherwise all-black colour scheme. Getting a good driving position is easy even in the entry-level Renault Megane because they get height-adjustable front seats as standard. You can also set the seat nice and low for a sporty feel and front seat passenger space is good. Accessing the rear seats is easy thanks to wide-opening doors and you can fit two adults without much hassle – three would be a push, because the middle rear seat is narrower than the outer two. In terms of practicality, the Renault Megane’s boot is just about big enough for a week’s holiday worth of luggage and the opening is wide enough so you won’t have problems loading bulky items. However, some alternatives, such as the Kia Ceed, have a lower load lip making them even more practical. The Renault Megane won’t wow you with a sporty drive, but you’ll be impressed by how comfortable it is. There are two engines to choose from in the Renault Megane range so picking the right one is easy. The 140bhp petrol is hushed on the move and feels best darting around city streets. The 115bhp diesel is perfect for longer motorway journeys where it settles nicely into a cruise and uses very little fuel. Driving the Renault Megane feels best on the motorway. Once up to speed there’s little wind noise and the Megane absorbs bumps very well. That isn’t to say it’s not good around town – there, the quick steering helps you dart in and out of traffic with confidence, however the manual gear shift is notchy and not that pleasurable to use. No matter if you drive in town or on the motorway, the Renault Megane is a safe car. It was awarded the full five stars from EuroNCAP and, as standard, you get essentials such as airbags, an advanced stability control system and hill-hold assist. Mid-range models also get lane departure warning, traffic sign recognition and automatic high-low beam as standard."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/renault/captur,Renault Captur Review & Prices,"£22,195",8/10,"The market is awash with small SUVs these days, meaning it takes a lot to stand out. If you’re looking for such a car with a bit of Parisian flair, the Renault Captur could be right down your alley. It’s a slightly more stylish alternative to cars like the Toyota Yaris Cross and Skoda Kamiq . It’s like comparing Nutella on toast to a freshly-baked pain au chocolat - both make for a great breakfast, but the latter looks more attractive and tastes better. The Captur was given a mid-life update in 2024 which brought a new face inspired by the Scenic E-Tech . It has arrow-shaped LED daytime running lights and redesigned bumpers, as well as a range of new alloy wheel designs. Step inside and you’re greeted with some interior upgrades as well. The rotary climate controls were ditched in favour of a neat row of toggle switches, and there’s no leather or chrome used inside to make it more eco-friendly. The biggest change though is the new Google-based infotainment system. All but the entry-level car get this and it’s really easy to use. You get Google Maps built in, as well as wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto to make it easy to pair your phone. It’s controlled through a 10.4-inch touchscreen, something you also get on the basic car without the Google software. Everything you regularly touch feels plush and well-screwed together, and there are plenty of squidgy materials throughout the cabin. A Peugeot 2008 does feel slightly more posh, but there’s not much in it. One area where the Captur impresses is boot space, because it offers more load capacity than a lot of alternatives. There’s also plenty of space up front to get comfortable behind the wheel, and there’s decent legroom in the back. Rear headroom is a bit tight though, a Skoda Kamiq is better for carrying adults. Another party trick the Captur boasts is the sliding rear seats. You can pull them all the way forward to expand the space from 484 litres to a whopping 616 litres, making it among the largest of any small SUV. You do lose 136 litres of space if you go for the hybrid model, making it slightly smaller than a Toyota Yaris Cross’s boot, but it’s still bigger than a Nissan Juke’s . As part of the Captur’s 2024 update Renault slimmed down the engine lineup, so there are now just two to choose from. You can either have a 90hp 1.0-litre petrol engine with a six-speed manual gearbox, or there’s the 1.6-litre petrol hybrid with 145hp. If you can stretch to it, spending the extra for the hybrid is well worth it. It can run on electric power alone around town to save fuel – at low speeds the engine only cuts in when absolutely necessary and it’s hardly noticeable when it does. What’s not so good in town is the firm suspension, which jiggles and bobs you around over every bump in the road. The Captur won’t thrill you on a country road, but that’s not why you buy a small SUV. That said, the Ford Puma can put a smile on your face through the bends. More importantly, the Renault has precise steering and minimal body roll, both of which inspire confidence. Overall, the Renault Captur draws you in with its stylish exterior and it offers a practical interior and great tech. It doesn’t drive quite as nicely as some of the best small SUVs thanks to the firm suspension, but it’ll still serve you well as a great all-rounder. If this sounds like your next small SUV, then head over to our Renault Captur deals pages to see how much you can save. If you're interested in buying a used Renault Captur then head over to our used deals page , and you can also look at other used Renault models . If you want to change your car altogether, you can sell your car through Carwow, where our trusted dealers will bid on your car to get you the best price."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/renault/symbioz,Renault Symbioz Review & Prices,"£27,395",8/10,"The Renault Symbioz is a bit like a Renault Captur that’s been out and got bum implants. From the front, you’d never know the two cars were different - the only changes come when you go round the rear, where the Symbioz has a longer body and a bigger boot. In many ways it’s sort of like an estate version of the Captur - like a Volkswagen Golf Estate is to a regular Golf hatchback . It’s aimed at people who like the Captur but want more space inside, and who can’t quite stretch up to the pricier, posher Renault Austral . Though it’s a little smaller, it provides an interesting alternative to super-popular family SUVs such as the Nissan Qashqai , Kia Sportage or Skoda Karoq . We’re not kidding when we tell you the Symbioz looks like a Captur. In fact, take the two cars in the same colour and from the front doors forwards, you’ll be hard-pressed to notice any changes at all. They’re limited to a couple of chrome flashes in the lower bumper line for the Symbioz, a slightly different pattern to the grille, and some alternative alloy wheel designs. The changes come from the rear doors backwards, where the Symbioz has a longer body with a bigger rear overhang to make more room for a big boot. The roofline and rear windows have been altered to accommodate this, and there’s a slightly more chiselled pattern on the rear doors. The interior's very similar too. The dashboards are identical, and feature a Google-powered infotainment system that's a pleasure to use. One feature the Symbioz has over the Captur is its stunning 'Solarbay' glass roof - this eschews a traditional blind for electrochromic glass which can become opaque at the touch of a button. Very fancy. The Symbioz has a 492-litre boot, which is quite a bit larger than the 348-litre boot you get on a hybrid Captur (the plain petrol Captur has 422 litres of space). That’s a little less room than the 504-litre Nissan Qashqai, 521-litre Skoda Karoq or 587-litre Kia Sportage, but impressive for what’s still quite a small car overall. The Symbioz is being pitched as a slightly more premium offering to the Captur, too. That means you don’t get a base-spec ‘Evolution’ trim level, nor can you specify the Captur’s 90hp petrol engine and manual gearbox. All Symbioz models come with Renault’s E-Tech hybrid system , which is super-efficient, promising over 60mpg if driven carefully. It’s a little clunky, though, thanks to its complicated gearbox, and that’s mirrored in the suspension which can feel quite firm when you’re driving round town at low speeds. In most scenarios, though, the Symbioz is perfectly fine to drive - though the extra weight does mean a Captur is more enjoyable. Interested?

https://www.carwow.co.uk/renault/clio,Renault Clio Review & Prices,"£18,995",9/10,"If you’re looking for an affordable city car, but don’t want to sacrifice on style and practicality, the Renault Clio is an excellent option. It looks great inside and out and has a bigger boot than any of its small hatchback alternatives – so it’s good looking and practical, like a supermodel wearing cargo pants. And a little nip and tuck for 2023 means it looks better than ever, with similar chic appeal to the Peugeot 208 , making the pair stand out from the likes of the Ford Fiesta , Volkswagen Polo and Vauxhall Corsa . But it's so much cheaper than the 208 that it represents fantastic value - earning it a Highly Commended spot in the Smart Spender category of the 2025 Carwow Car of the Year Awards . It’s up front where it’s really eye-catching now, with slim headlights and funky vertical daytime running lights flanking a new grille and prominent Renault logo. Round the back the new look is less obvious, but a tweaked bumper helps make the Clio look much more interesting. It’s a similar story inside, with the profile-orientated infotainment display (on top-spec models) and new climate control buttons giving off a more premium feel than before. And while some scratchy plastics lower in the cabin betray the car’s price, there are plenty of soft surfaces that are suitably upmarket. For a small car , it’s not at all cramped in the front, but those in the back will struggle for kneeroom in particular. Storage is fine wherever you sit, but you’ll want to leave most things in the cavernous boot – at 391 litres it’s more spacious than any alternatives' boots. A hybrid engine gives the Renault a head start on other options, too. The Honda Jazz and Toyota Yaris are just about your only other choices for small car electrification. There’s a regular petrol engine in the Clio too, which brings the price down and is appealing for those on a budget. Out on the road the hybrid works well, with the electric motor offering instant response at lower speeds and helping to keep fuel costs low. The petrol engine can get a bit noisy when accelerating up to motorway speeds, but settles down nicely once you get there. That said, the Volkswagen Polo is a quieter and more refined small car to drive. There’s a bit more tyre roar at high speeds in the Clio, and it’s more easily ruffled by bumps in the road. It shouldn’t be enough to put you off though, and with its appealing mix of style and practicality, the Renault Clio is a car you can shortlist with your heart as well as your head – especially considering it’s also one of the more affordable options. See how much you could save by browsing Renault Clio deals on Carwow, or get a great price on a used Clio . You can also browse other used Renaults , and if you want to sell your car online , Carwow can help with that, too."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/renault/arkana,Renault Arkana Review & Prices,"£27,600",6/10,"If you fancy a sporty-looking coupe SUV, your only options used to be big, posh German cars like the BMW X4 and Mercedes GLC Coupe , but there are a couple of more reasonably-priced models out there now which offer similar sleek styling, one of these being the Renault Arkana. You can think of it as a slightly left-field alternative to cars such as the Skoda Karoq or the Nissan Qashqai . If those cars are a bowl of porridge for breakfast, the Arkana is more like a pain au chocolat. It may not be as sensible, but it’s a more exciting option. You may also be considering the Peugeot 408 , which has bolder styling. The front end will be familiar from other Renaults thanks to the C-shaped LED running lights, and you get LED headlights on mid-spec cars and up. It’s the side profile that really sets the Arkana apart, with a swoopy coupe-esque roofline lending it a sporty edge over alternatives. This may look cool, however it doesn’t do much for interior space. While those up front won’t have any trouble getting comfortable, thanks to plenty of adjustment in the seats and steering wheel, the back seats aren't quite so accommodating. Headroom is pretty limited and there’s not much in the way of legroom either. A Skoda Karoq is a better bet for carrying people on a regular basis. It may not be the most practical cabin, but at least it's well made. There are plenty of plush materials to be found, and everything feels well screwed together. The metallic feeling dials for the climate control are a particularly welcome addition, however, the interior doesn’t have quite the same design flair as a Peugeot 408. At 480 litres, the boot is a decent size. It’s slightly bigger than a Peugeot 408 hybrid, but it’s a lot smaller than a Citroen C5 X and there are no clever features like a 12-volt socket or some hooks for your shopping bags. As for interior cubby spaces, you get an average glovebox and some large door pockets, but that’s pretty much it other than a pair of cupholders and a small cubby under the armrest. What the Arkana lacks in interior space, it makes up for in standard equipment. Even entry-level Evolution models get a 7.0-inch touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto and rear parking sensors with a reversing camera, but if you step up to the Techno model you get a better-looking 9.3-inch screen. As for engines, you have a choice of one. The Arkana comes only with a 1.6-litre full hybrid. If you’re after a diesel SUV, you’re out of luck here. Take a look at the Citroen C5 Aircross instead. The 145hp hybrid system should return a claimed 60mpg, however a week with the car in a mixture of driving conditions saw us return an average of 44mpg. Behind the wheel the Arkana isn’t as sporty to drive as the styling would suggest. A Ford Kuga will put a bigger smile on your face. The suspension is also quite firm, so driving on broken roads can become tiring. The Arkana is at its best on the motorway. It’s pretty smooth at speed, however the bigger wheels on the Esprit Alpine model do generate a bit of tyre noise. The Renault Arkana may not be the most practical SUV on the market, however, it’s still worth considering if you're after a sporty-looking SUV with plenty of standard equipment and a decent price tag. Keen on making a Renault Arkana your next car? Check out the latest Renault Arkana offers available through Carwow, as well as the best deals on the Renault line-up as a whole. Plus, we've got a wide selection of used Renaults , and once you've picked your next car, you can sell your car through Carwow too."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/renault/megane-sports-tourer,Renault Megane Sports Tourer Review and Prices,"£18,790",7/10,"Sadly, it’s an option on this Renault – but one we would highly recommend. Its 8.7-inch width is large for this class, especially when you consider its portrait style, and the detailed graphics are matched by no rivals. Sadly, the rest of the interior’s design fails to stand out – solidly built though it is – and it’s a bit of a let down given the sharp-suited exterior. It’s hard to complain about the space on offer, though. There’s room for four adults and the rear seats recline further back than in the Megane hatchback. But, given that this is the estate model, it’s the healthy 580-litre boot that will matter to most people – even if it’s outgunned by the 610-litre load bay in the Skoda Octavia estate. The Sport Tourer’s boot is full of useful features too: the floor height is adjustable, you get dividers to split up the space and hooks to keep your shopping upright. Those hooks may prove more useful than you might imagine if you go for the warm GT model that has four-wheel steering and a quick shifting EDC twin-clutch gearbox. The rest of the range is more on the relaxed side, making the Megane Sport Tourer one of the most comfortable in class. The GT model sports a 204hp 1.6-litre petrol engine that will be good for 0-62mph in close to seven seconds. Lower down the range you can choose between a nippy 130hp 1.2-litre petrol or two diesels – a 110hp 1.5-litre or a 130hp 1.6. Both the diesels can return fuel economy of around 70mpg. Standard equipment on entry-level Expression+ models includes a Bluetooth phone connection, DAB digital radio, a height adjustable driver’s seat, air-conditioning, and four electric windows. What it lacks in polish, the Megane Sport Tourer makes up for with stylish looks If you’re in the market for a new mid-size estate car and you’re the sort of person that likes traditional things such as Shepherd’s pie you may be a bit befuddled by the Megane’s nontraditional dashboard layout and concept-car looks. You might think this is some sort of foie gras that will taste a bit funny and not fill you up at all. However, the Renault Megane Sport Tourer isn’t a fancy French dish that’s only good to look at. Because it has things that are really important to get right in a family estate car such as a comfortable ride, one of the best touch-screen infotainment systems in class and a boot filled with practical features, the Sport Tourer is more like your traditional bangers and mash, but prepared by a Michelin star chef to look like something really special. So with all its talents, the Megane Sport Tourer is an even better proposition than its hatchback sibling and definitely should be near the top of your shortlist."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/renault/zoe,Renault Zoe Review & Prices,"£7,699",8/10,"The Renault Zoe is a small electric car with a decent range that’s an alternative to models such as the Mini E and Peugeot e-208 . The Zoe has been around for a while now, but gets regular updates, so it’s a bit like an iPhone in that it looks mostly unchanged year after year, yet contains the very latest technology. The current model’s latest updates include a few more air intakes than its predecessor – some of which help guide air past the front wheels to help reduce drag and maximise range – and a set of full-LED headlights. Renault has given the Zoe’s brake lights the LED treatment too; ditching the old car’s blue lens coating in the process. More exciting than this, however, is what lies inside. There’s a super-slick dashboard layout, a classy infotainment system and a digital driver’s display as standard. You can even get the dashboard trimmed in some whale-friendly recycled material made from old plastic bottles. Thankfully, the Renault Zoe is really comfortable inside – in the front, at least. Those in the back will feel pretty hemmed-in if they’re close to six-feet tall and there isn’t enough shoulder room to carry three adults. Chances are, you won’t be using your dinky electric city car for lugging heavy loads. Rather, you’ll be nipping through rush-hour traffic – something the Zoe feels born to do. You get a good view forward thanks to its large windows, and the light controls make tight turns a doddle. The new Renault Zoe is capable of more than just trips to the shops, though. With its batteries fully brimmed – which takes three hours from empty using a public 22kW charger – you’ll be able to travel up to 239 miles. Charging at home using the standard 7 kWh setup will take just over nine hours. However, a 30-minute charge using a 50kW fast charger will give you 90 miles of range. This fast- charging feature is optional on the base trim and standard on the top version. It’s pretty perky for a small car, too, so you’ll have no issue scooting away from junctions or overtaking sluggish lorries. That said, the Renault Zoe doesn’t make a particularly good motorway cruiser. Sure, its electric motor is much quieter than a petrol or diesel engine, but you’ll still hear a fair amount of wind and tyre noise at speed. You do at least get cruise control to make long journeys a bit more bearable. Another point to consider is the rather poor Euro NCAP retested safety rating it received in 2021. You shouldn’t let this put you off, though. The Renault Zoe is a very capable small electric car that comes with decent range and peppy performance, and recent updates mean you get a pretty impressive amount of standard kit, too. Just don’t go trying to carry tall adults in the back. Head over to our Renault Zoe deals page to see how much you can save or take a look at our used Renault Zoe deals ."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/renault/megane-etech-electric,Renault Megane E-Tech Electric Review & Prices,"£32,495",8/10,"If you’re looking for a stylish electric hatchback , the Renault Megane E-Tech is one worth considering. It’s the sort of car to be looking at if you’re considering an electric hatchback such as the Volkswagen ID3 , Cupra Born or MG4 EV . This Megane is like one of your mates who’s suddenly decided to take on a vegan, eco-conscious lifestyle. Gone are its petrol versions, with just electric power coming in its place, plus a bunch of eco-friendly materials. But more on those shortly. There’s no questioning that the Renault Megane E-Tech Electric is a looker. A striking front-end design, sleek roofline and strong selection of two-tone colour choices certainly allow it to stand out. You’ll get 18-inch wheels as standard, but there’s a set of optional 20-inch alloys if those aren’t large enough for you. It’s just as stylish inside, too. You’re met immediately with a two-spoke steering wheel that offers something of a throwback feel (if you look beyond all the buttons), plus a host of recycled fabrics that look and feel the part. You can go for leather on top-spec cars, though. Range: 280 miles Efficiency: 3.9 miles per kWh Battery size: 60kWh Max charge speed: 130kW Charge time AC: 9hrs 11mins, 0-100% at 7kW Charge time DC: 1hr 14mins, 0-80% at 130kW Charge port location: Right front Power outputs: 215hp Directly in your line of vision is a 12.3-inch digital driver’s display that’s crisp and very configurable. To the side of that, you’ll find a portrait-set infotainment system that serves as evidence car manufacturers should bin off developing their own software and leave it to tech companies. This isn’t a dig at Renault, as it uses a new Google-based system here in the Megane. It’s super-sharp, dead easy to use and comes with impressive Google Maps integration without charging you any extra for the privilege. It helps that the assistant for voice controls is easy to use and rarely mishears you, too. However, the Megane is let down a little in the practicality stakes. Its roofline helps the design, but it does mean headroom in the back isn’t great, although there’s a good amount of knee room. The Renault’s boot comes in at a healthy 440 litres, which is comfortably more than the VW ID3’s 385 litres. However, it’s hindered by a massive lip that can make loading difficult — and storing the charging cables under the boot floor will mean playing real-life Tetris every time you want to charge while carrying a full load. The Megane comes with just the one power output, giving a 220hp instant surge of torque. It comes with a 60kWh battery, which offers 292 claimed miles between charges. In other markets there is also a cheaper and lower-powered 130hp version with a choice of battery sizes, but this isn’t offered in the UK. Hook it up to a 130kW rapid charger you’ll be able to complete a full charge in a little over 70 minutes. A 7.4kW home wall box charger will take just over 9 hours. Around town, the Megane’s light and direct steering make zipping around a breeze. That said, massive pillars at the front and a narrow rear window result in pretty poor visibility. You can have a rear-view camera displayed on the mirror to help the latter issue, but it’ll cost you. Take it out on the motorway and its soft-set suspension results in a smooth ride, though this combined with light steering does detract from your ability to have fun on twisty roads. So if you’re looking to add some style and sustainability to your driveway, the Renault Megane E-Tech should have a place on your shortlist. Head on over to our Renault deals page to see how much you can save on a Megane E-Tech when you buy through carwow. You can also save money on other Renaults , or if you’re in the market for a used model instead, we have a marketplace for that as well. If you want to change your car altogether, you can sell your car with our trusted dealers bidding on your car so you can get the best price."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/renault/kadjar,Renault Kadjar Review & Prices,"£5,290",8/10,"The Renault Kadjar is the French firm’s contender in the big-selling family SUV category. These cars sell in huge numbers these days because they’re more spacious than a conventional hatchback with a higher driving position, although they cost a bit more to run. Think of the Renault Kadjar as a Nissan Qashqai with a little more je ne sais quoi and you won’t go far wrong, because underneath it shares much of its running gear with the Japanese car. The Renault Kadjar looks a lot more imposing on the outside than a hatchback such as the VW Golf or Renault Megane . It comes with large alloy wheels, a smattering of chrome trim and plenty of contrasting black trim on the bumpers and wheel arches so it’ll have no trouble standing out on the school run. Sadly, the Renault Kadjar’s interior isn’t quite as eye-catching as that in some other SUVs. Sure, it has plenty of soft plastics and a few brushed metal trims, but the Kia Sportage looks more exciting while the VW Tiguan feels more solidly put together. It comes with a good deal of equipment though, you get a digital driver’s display as standard, alongside a touchscreen infotainment system. It all looks pretty flash, but using the built-in sat nav is a bit trickier than in alternatives – a bit like paying for something with cash rather than using your contactless bank card. At least you’ll be sitting comfortably while you fiddle with the Renault Kadjar’s touchscreen. You get plenty of seat and steering-wheel adjustment as standard and there’s enough space for you to stretch out if you’re tall. It’s a similar story in the back where there’s room for three adults, but you don’t get any clever sliding seats like in the Skoda Karoq . The boot’s roomy enough for everyone’s luggage, though, and the flat boot floor makes it easy to slide in heavy luggage. There’s a 138hp petrol engine which provides a good mix of performance and efficiency, and you can option it with an automatic transmission rather than the manual to help take the stress out of town driving. Whichever transmission you pick, you’ll find the Renault Kadjar is pretty comfortable to drive. It doesn’t quite iron out bumps as well as the Nissan Qashqai, but it’s more relaxing than the Kia Sportage and Hyundai Tucson and doesn’t lean a great deal in tight corners. Unfortunately, the Kadjar is a little noisy to drive at motorway speeds. This isn’t because of its engine, rather you’ll hear quite a lot of wind and tyre noise. To help make things a bit more relaxing, you can get it with a range of driver assistance systems from automatic emergency braking and cruise control to lane-departure warning. All this makes the Renault Kadjar pretty easy to live with every day. It’s certainly an SUV that’s well worth considering if you’re looking for something that’s easy to drive, practical and pretty well equipped. Head over to the deals page to find some great deals on a brand new SUV , and if you're wanting a used Renault Kadjar then we have a great range of second-hand ones to choose from."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/renault/5-e-tech,Renault 5 E-Tech Review & Prices,"£22,995",9/10,"The Renault 5 is an all-electric reinvention of an iconic hatchback . It’s good value for money, looks great inside and out, and it’s fun to drive – but being a small, city-friendly electric car , it’s not particularly practical. It’s a bit like finding one of your old football shirts from when you were a kid – the retro charm is very on-trend, but you might have to squeeze to fit in… There are other small electric cars to consider, none of which have particularly cavernous cabins. The Citroen e-C3 and Hyundai Inster are the obvious alternatives, but there’s also the slightly bigger, slightly more expensive BYD Dolphin . Beauty might be in the eye of the beholder but it’s hard to argue that the Renault 5 looks anything other than absolutely fantastic. Its small dimensions, boxy shape and retro look are all inspired by the ‘70s model of the same name, just with a modern spin. There are some cool details, from the broken square daytime running lights (a nod to the original) to the illuminated ‘5’ logo on the bonnet that indicates your battery charge. Range: 192 - 252 miles Efficiency: 4.1 - 4.3 miles per kWh Battery size: 40kWh / 50kWh Max charge speed: 80kW / 100kW Charge time AC: 3h 59m - 4h 51m 0 - 100%, 11kWh Charge time DC: 30 - 31m, 15 - 80%, 80-100kWh Charge port location: Right side front Power outputs: 120hp / 150hp It’s really cool inside, too. The air vents mimic the headlight design and the dashboard ahead of the passenger has fabric, recycled denim or synthetic upholstery, depending on your trim, which looks great. There are some quirky colour combinations to be had, too. Renault has resisted the urge to plaster massive screens in a small car , so the driver display and infotainment are integrated nicely within a single housing. They’re big enough, with blocky graphics that are easy to use on the move. Snappy loading between menus and physical climate controls are further plus points, and Google software means it has useful apps built-in. Entry-level cars get a smaller driver’s display, though. As you might expect of a car this size, it’s not the most practical cabin. Space in the front is okay, especially for the passenger, but taller drivers might find the space beneath the steering wheel a bit tight. The back seats are a touch cramped, too. The flip side of this is the boot, which is an impressive 326 litres – that’s more capacity than you get in both the Mini Cooper Electric and Citroen e-C3. There are two battery options, the smaller one returning up to 190 miles and the larger one offering up to 250 miles, the latter also coming with a more powerful electric motor. That’s about par for the course for small EVs, as the e-C3 gets up to 199 miles between charges, while the Inster has between 203 and 229 miles, depending on the model. Naturally, the Renault 5 is most at home in the city, where its small dimensions and punchy electric motors make it ideal for nipping about in tight, busy urban areas, even if the suspension is a bit stiff, making you aware of small bumps in the road. These attributes also combine to create a car that’s great fun on a twisty road. Because it’s small it’s ideal for narrow strips of Tarmac in the British countryside, and the sharp steering and lack of body roll make it great fun in corners. It’s a bit noisy at motorway speeds, but no more than the Citroen and Hyundai . All in all, the Renault 5 is a fantastic little electric car. It’s oozing charm, and will put a smile on your face every time you drive it – just don’t expect all-round family car practicality. If that sounds ideal for your needs, check out the latest Renault 5 deals on Carwow, as well as Renault 5 leasing deals .

It’s an imposing car to look at – it’s 20mm wider than the car it replaces and comes as standard with two-tone paint and blingy 20-inch alloy wheels that look, well, fantastic! Those looks couldn’t come at the expense of practicality, though, so the Renault has a big boot, cubbyholes and under-seat bins that provide 63 litres of storage and one of the most elaborate gloveboxes we have ever seen. The engine range is extensive, too. Buyers can choose from five diesels, two petrols and a diesel-electric hybrid that returns fuel economy of 80.4mpg. Petrols are manual only, but diesels are available with a six-speed manual or a dual-clutch auto with the same number of gears. All models come with emergency city braking that works at speed of up to 31mph and can detect people (a class first), cruise control, two Isofix child-seat mounting points, a height adjustable driver’s seat and a Bluetooth phone connection. If you like the look of an SUV, but don't need the high ride height, the Scenic is perfect for you The Renault Espace was arguably the first MPV ever made and that expertise shows in this new Scenic. There’s much to like here, not least its cheap running costs and practical interior. Sure, the VW Touran is better to drive and the Citroen C4 Picasso is more comfortable, but the Scenic – much like the Espace – offers something genuinely unique here – stylish looks that don’t punish you for needing a practical car."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/renault/twingo,Renault Twingo Review and Prices,"£8,235",5/10,"The Renault Twingo is the smallest car that Renault makes and it’s an alternative to other little city slickers, such as the Volkswagen Up, Toyota Aygo and Hyundai i10. However, if you’re familiar with previous generations of the Twingo, this is something very different. It was developed alongside the Smart ForFour, so this latest version is a rear-engined, rear-wheel drive car – a layout that has real benefits in terms of how much space the car has inside and how easy it is to drive around town. Mind you, there’s no sign of that revolutionary (for a city car) layout from the outside. That said, the car certainly looks very distinctive and, as with most little cars these days, there’s lots of scope for the owner to personalise their car. Everything from the colour of the paint to the alloy wheels can be tailored to your wishes, while you can also add on extra decals to make your car stand out. Inside, too, the contrasting colours and strong design inject a bit of fun into the experience. And, as long as you avoid the base model, you can add a few more touches of personalisation. One more clever touch is that Renault has an app that you can install on your smartphone. You then clip it into a cradle in the car, giving you an instant touchscreen, which you can use to control the sat-nav, phone and stereo. If you want a larger touchscreen, you can fit the optional R-Link system, which has an integrated 7.0-inch screen, through which you control the various parts of the infotainment system. Where the Renault Twingo really stands out from the alternatives is how much room it has inside. Four adults can fit with ease and getting in and out is not the contortionist’s feat it can be in some small cars. Mind you, the optional fabric sunroof reduces the available headroom quite significantly, so be sure that won’t be a problem before ticking that box. That excellent cabin space is thanks to having the engine at the back, but there are some compromises with that layout. Most obviously, as the engine sits below the boot floor, the boot capacity is only 188 litres, which is a little less than you’ll find in an Up, for example. When I read that the Twingo was going to be a small, rear-engined, rear-wheel car, I was really excited. Then I drove it. What a disappointment. You can increase this by putting the rear seat backs up to 90 degrees, which isn’t especially comfortable, but there’s also around 50 litres of storage dotted around in the cabin too in various pockets and bins. You can also fold the front passenger seat flat and the Renault Twingo will accept loads up to 2.3-metres long. The one thing that the rear-engined layout doesn’t do is to turn the Twingo into some sort of mini-Porsche 911 supercar, which famously shares the same arrangement. In fact, this doesn’t feel like a particularly sporty car to drive at all – but it’s not without its benefits. For example, with no engine at the front of the car, the nose feels a lot lighter. And, because the car is rear-wheel drive, the front wheels can turn further than in a front-wheel drive car, giving a very tight turning circle. As a result, the car is wonderfully easy to manoeuvre around town and get into the smallest parking spaces. However, on the open road, it’s not the most enjoyable little car to drive. In part, that’s because the stability control system is a little over-eager to get involved when the driver gets a little keener and starts to tackle bends a bit more quickly. Likewise, the Twingo isn’t the most comfortable little car, especially the models with larger wheels fitted. The VW Up and Hyundai i10 both have a more settled and more mature feel on the road. As is often the case with these small cars, there’s only a small range of engines to pick from. So, if you want a Twingo, you can only choose between two engines: a 1.0-litre unit with 70hp and a more powerful 0.9-litre turbo, with 90hp. The 1.0-litre unit is enough if you spend most of your time driving around town, but it’s worth going for the stronger unit if you plan on making longer journeys beyond the city limits. No matter where you’re heading, you’ll be pleased to know that the Renault Twingo has a reasonable four-star rating from Euro NCAP, which is pretty much identical to what you’ll find in most alternatives. Less happily, the Renault Twingo costs a bit more than the most obvious alternatives, but every model comes well equipped – with DAB radio, front electric windows, split folding rear seats, LED daytime running lights, a tyre pressure monitoring system and USB connectivity. Despite that high level of standard equipment and generous space for passengers, the Twingo is hard to recommend over the alternatives. It’s a little on the pricey side at the bottom end of the range and, while the more expensive models (with the stronger engine) make more sense, they cost as much as larger vehicles that offer far more space."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/renault/austral,Renault Austral Review & Prices,"£34,195",8/10,"The Renault Austral is one of many mid-sized SUVs vying for your attention, making it an alternative to the likes of the Nissan Qashqai , Hyundai Tucson , Kia Sportage , Peugeot 3008 and Volkswagen Tiguan - to name a few. With impressive options available everywhere you turn, the Renault Austral attempts to stand out with a few key features - a really posh interior, great software, and a trick hybrid system which gives this medium-sized family car fuel economy to rival many a small hatchback. It’s like shopping at a designer outlet store - you can feel like you’re living the high life for less money than you expect, but it doesn’t come without compromise. The Austral is a smart-looking SUV, with its fairly square silhouette tempered by rounded corners and some distinctive styling features. The bold headlights, large grille and huge Renault badge mean you won’t mistake it for anything else, while the rear gets similarly wide taillights (though not a full-width light bar) and a sporty-looking diffuser on the bumper. The interior is similarly stylish, with a large portrait touchscreen canted towards the driver for a really focused, cockpit-like feel. There’s even a handrest in the middle that feels like an aircraft throttle, though this actually contains a wireless charging pad and hides a storage cubby underneath it. That central touchscreen runs a fantastic Google-based infotainment system. This means that not only is it swift and responsive, but it has native support for Google apps - including the best maps in the business, and other useful touches like music streaming services baked right in. While the Austral does feature smartphone mirroring tech, if you’re already using Google services you might not find that you need it here. While the Austral’s interior punches above its price tag, the space inside is only average. A Skoda Karoq does have more rear-seat space, and more flexible arrangements for the boot. While the Austral has a sliding rear seat, you need it pushed all the way back to fit people in - at which point you only have a 430-litre boot, which is among the smallest of all the alternatives. A Nissan Qashqai, Kia Sportage and Skoda Karoq are all larger. Renault offers the Austral with just one engine - a complex hybrid arrangement using a 1.2-litre petrol engine and a pair of electric motors. It’s fiendishly complicated and shuffles the power about in ways that don’t always seem logical. The result can feel quite clunky if you accelerate hard or are trying to hustle down a back road, but it’s perfectly smooth when you’re driving sensibly - and means this relatively large SUV can easily return over 50mpg. The driving experience is a lot like the rest of the car - it has its good moments and bad. The steering is nice and accurate, and the Austral is comfortable on a long trip - but the firm suspension means it clatters over bumps at low speeds around town, making small potholes and bumps feel much larger than they are. At launch, the Renault Austral was offered with a cool four-wheel steering system which made it incredibly manoeuvrable around town. However, as of 2024, this is no longer offered If you want a great price for this family-friendly SUV, check out our best Renault Austral deals on Carwow here. You can find used Australs for sale here, or see other used Renaults for sale here.

https://www.carwow.co.uk/citroen/e-c3,Citroen e-C3 Review & Prices,"£22,095",9/10,"The new Citroen C3 is a very different beast from its predecessor . Where the old car was a regular small hatchback , the new model has a distinct SUV flavour to it. It’s based on a new platform which is cheaper to build than the old car, and as a result Citroen’s able to offer the all-electric Citroen e-C3 for pretty much the same price as a comparably-sized petrol car from other manufacturers. It's the sort of remarkable value which means the Citroen e-C3 was Highly Commended in the Smart Spender category of the 2025 Carwow Car of the Year Awards . It’s like a holiday to Croatia - on paper, at least, you seem to get a lot for your money. But does that mean it’s even remotely desirable - or is it just cheap and nasty? That’s what we’re here to find out. With prices for this electric e-C3 starting at less than £22,000, alternatives are difficult to come across. It sits a few thousand pounds beneath the cheapest examples of ‘proper’ electric cars, such as the BYD Dolphin , but is still more expensive than pure city cars like the Dacia Spring . The most obvious alternatives are the Hyundai Inster and Renault 5 . It’s a really exciting price point that could make electric motoring accessible to a new swathe of drivers. Range: 199 miles (WLTP) Efficiency: 4.5 mi/kWh Battery size: 44kWh Max charge speed: 100kW Charge time AC: 0-100% in 6 hours (7.4kW) Charge time DC: 20-80% in 26 minutes (100kW) Charge port location: Left rear Power outputs: 113hp It’s a couple of centimetres longer and a tad wider than the Citroen C3 it replaces. But at a full 10cm taller its silhouette is more akin to small SUVs, like the VW T-Cross . That means you get reasonable legroom for four six-foot passengers and bags of headroom inside, plus a 310-litre boot that’s bigger than you’ll find on a Vauxhall Corsa. The interior, meanwhile, is clearly built to a price but hides it well through clever material choices. A big swathe of fabric trim across the dashboard covers up what would otherwise be hard, nasty plastic, and the steering wheel and switchgear - what little there is - actually feels pretty nice to the touch. You get a really simple driver information display above the steering wheel which just shows your speed, range and efficiency information - no extra fancy touches like sat-nav directions or album artwork. For that, you’ll need to turn to the 10.3-inch infotainment system, which feels rather simplified compared to the setups you’ll find in other Citroens but does work well enough. You can always bypass it, with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto , and even a wireless smartphone charging pad on top models. Whichever model you select, you get the same combination of a 113hp electric motor and a 44kWh battery pack. Those are modest numbers, but they combine to give perfectly adequate performance even on a motorway cruise, and an official range of up to 199 miles. The e-C3’s also really set-up for comfort, which is a nice change from all those try-hard faux-sporty SUVs. Though it leans a lot in the corners, the payoff is suspension that soaks up bumps and potholes with ease, plus really comfortable seats that take the edge off poor road surfaces.

https://www.carwow.co.uk/citroen/e-berlingo,Citroen e-Berlingo Review & Prices,"£31,240",7/10,"The Citroen e-Berlingo is a car built for a better world. A world where badge snobbery isn’t a thing; where people aren’t taken in by the false idea that a practical family car must be SUV -shaped. The e-Berlingo might be van-based, but it has a quirky character all of its own, and is kind of stylish in an anti-fashion sort of way. Basically, it’s as if JML, that company that advertises on daytime TV, made a car — something that’s so practical, you didn’t realise you needed it. If you’re assuming that being van-based means that the e-Berlingo is going to rattle and smoke with nasty old diesel power, forget it — there is, thanks to customer demand, a diesel Berlingo on sale once again, but this e-Berlingo gets a 136hp electric motor driving the front wheels, which is fed energy from a 54kWh lithium-ion battery. In theory, a full charge of that battery will take you for a total of 212 miles, but to be honest the e-Berlingo will struggle to match that claim. Aim on getting somewhere between 150 and 180 miles if you’re driving in mixed conditions, and probably as little as 140 miles if you’re pounding up and down the motorway. Range: 212 miles Efficiency: 2.8-3.5 miles per kWh Battery size: 54kWh Max charge speed: 100kW Charge time AC: 7-8hrs 0-100% Charge time DC: 30mins 10-80% Charge port location: Left rear Power outputs: 136hp (in Sport mode) The total useable capacity of that battery is 50kWh, and the e-Berlingo charges at up to 100kW from a DC public fast charger , so you can top up fairly quickly, getting from 0% to 80% charge in 30 minutes — although it will be a brave e-Berlingo driver who dares to run the battery down to 0% before connecting to a charger. Charging at home , on a 7.4kW wallbox, will give you a full charge, from flat, in about eight hours. Does that make the e-Berlingo less than practical? Yes, a bit, but it’s great for urban and intra-urban commuters, and there are helpful driving modes — Sport, Normal, and Eco — which can tweak the e-Berlingo’s performance according to your tastes. The e-Berlingo, just like the petrol and diesel models, comes in a choice of sizes. If you only need five seats and fancy a smaller vehicle for parking, then you can have the five-seat M version. If you need more space, there’s a longer model, called the XL, which comes with seven seats. Both versions come in either Plus or Max trim, and standard kit includes lots of safety equipment, folding picnic tables in the back seats, LED headlights (now in a new design featuring angled LED running light bars that look as if someone’s been buying up old nightclub glow-sticks), digital instruments, and a 10.0-inch touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto . High-spec Max models get luxury touches such as dual-zone climate, electric, heated door mirrors, a reversing camera, 17-inch alloy wheels, a heated steering wheel, Citroen’s ‘advanced comfort seats’, and three individual chairs in the back. Either way, the interior feels pretty cheap — it’s all van-grade plastics in there — but you’ll forgive that for the sheer amount of space on offer, and the acreage of practical storage areas. Speaking of which, both e-Berlingo models are almost ridiculously practical. Five-seat models offer 775-litres of boot space, while the seven-seater XL models have 209-litres. The third-row seats can be removed if you need more luggage space. Fold the whole lot down and you get a massive 4,000-litres of cargo space. To drive? Well, it’s a softly sprung electric van with not much range, so no-one is going to be using an e-Berlingo to do laps of Brands Hatch. It’s fine, as long as you’re prepared to take your time. The 136hp motor has enough power, but no more, and you’ll be spending most of your time slowing down to save on range anyway.

https://www.carwow.co.uk/citroen/e-c4,Citroen e-C4 Review & Prices,"£27,650",7/10,"The Citroen e-C4 is the all-electric version of the Citroen C4 . Like that car, it’s an odd mashup of hatchback , coupe and SUV - with compact dimensions, a dramatically sloping roofline, but a raised ride height and chunky bodywork. Where the standard C4 comes with either petrol or hybrid engines, the e-C4 electric car gets a choice of two electric motor and battery setups - but both of them have the same focus on comfort above sportiness, with clever hydraulic elements in the suspension and pillowy seats inside. It’s a bit like one of those sofas with the built-in electric recliners - steadfastly comfort-oriented but with a modern twist. The e-C4 got an extensive facelift in late 2024, bringing with it new front-end styling incorporating the latest iteration of Citroen’s logo. A large roundel dominates the front end while slim grilles flanked by triple-layer LED headlights also feature. At the rear, the main change is that the boot lid now has ‘CITROEN’ spelled out across its width. Range: 218 - 256 miles Efficiency: 4.4 - 4.7 mi/kWh Battery size: 50/54kWh Max charge speed: 100kW Charge time AC: 7hr 15m 0 - 100% Charge time DC: 30 minutes 10 - 80% Charge port location: Left side rear Power outputs: 136 - 156hp Otherwise, the e-C4’s styling is still an odd blend of classes. When it comes to size, it’s not dissimilar to an electric family hatchback such as a Volkswagen ID3 . However, it gets a raised ride height and high-set driving position, so you might shortlist it alongside compact SUVs such as the Kia EV3 , Hyundai Kona Electric or Volvo EX30 . In terms of price, however, the e-C4 is a match for some of the cheapest electric cars on sale - with the entry-level model being akin to a basic Vauxhall Corsa Electric , BYD Dolphin or MG4 EV . Compared to those cars, the e-C4 is quite practical. The rear seats are roomy enough and the 380-litre boot matches a Volkswagen Golf in capacity - notably, it’s no smaller than you get on a petrol C4, which isn’t always the case when an electric car is based on the same underpinnings as one with a petrol engine. You also get a really rather pleasant interior considering the price tag. Material quality is cheap in places, but everything you touch feels a notch or two higher-quality than you might expect. The fact that much of the switchgear is shared with posher cars, such as the Peugeot E-2008 , can’t hurt. There are two choices of electric motor with the e-C4. The lower two trim levels come with the same combination you got at launch - a 50kWh battery and 136hp electric motor. The top trim level gets slightly more capacity and power, but greater efficiency means the real-world range is hugely improved. Officially, the 50kWh car will do up to 218 miles on a charge, while the 54kWh version will do 256 miles. Whichever version you go for, don’t expect it to accelerate like a Tesla Model 3 . Performance is modest, but it’s nippy enough around town and like all electric cars is super-smooth and predictable. And unlike many EVs, which ride bumps like they have suspension made of wood, Citroen’s clever hydraulic setup effortlessly irons out imperfections around town and makes long journeys very comfortable indeed - at the expense of being less enjoyable to drive down a twisty road.

https://www.carwow.co.uk/citroen/ami,Citroen Ami Review & Prices,"£7,705",5/10,"The Citroen Ami is like a toy car broke out of the local shop, picked up the electric motor from a washing machine on the way out, and set off into the big world to try and be a ‘real car.’ It’s not quite a real car, though, as the in-car tech isn’t much better than you’d get from Matchbox or Hot Wheels… It’s hard to be hard on the Ami, simply because it’s so cute and comes across as being so plucky. Really, it’s not a car at all, but is technically a quadricycle and is aimed mostly at the French car market, where a quirk of the rules means that people as young as 14 can drive one of these. The UK market kind of got caught up in the massive publicity surrounding the Ami, which is why it’s here, and why Fiat will also bring in the similar Topolino (although Vauxhall has no plans to rebadge Opel’s version, the Rocks-e). The whole point of the Ami is that it’s cheap and durable, so the doors are the same on both sides (you can swap them around, which is why the hinges are on the front on one side, and at the back  on the other) while the headlights and brake lights are simple round items which pop into the same fixings. Citroen decided that it wouldn’t be worth the cost of setting the Ami up for right-hand drive, as that would make it pointlessly expensive, so it’s left-hand drive only, with the driver’s side accessed through the rear-hinged door. That’s OK, because the Ami will only ever be driven in town, and also because you’re surrounded by glass on all sides, making all-round visibility a doddle (which is also why there’s no rear-view mirror — just swivel your head). The cabin is spectacularly basic, mostly because the Ami was designed to be used by on-street car rental services, so it’s basically hose-out. The seats look like school chairs, but they’re actually pretty comfy, and there’ lots of space for bags and suchlike. There’s a simple digital speedo and range indicator, but if you want entertainment you’ll have to supply your own speaker or headphones. There’s space for a suitcase on the floor of the passenger side, but not much else, although there are some storage spaces and a shelf below the windscreen. It’s not really a practical car, the Ami, but it’s OK for small shopping trips or urban school runs. Specifically urban school runs, though. Technically, you could drive an Ami on the motorway, but with a 28mph top speed it’s going to be pretty scary. There’s a tiny 8hp electric motor, which gives the Ami acceleration of 7.4 seconds… to get to 25mph. Still, it’s fine around town as long as you don’t accidentally wander into a 50mph zone… The 5.4kWh battery is tiny, so the range is just 46 miles at best, but the tiny size pays off because the battery can be charged back up in just four hours from a three-pin domestic socket, and the Ami even has its own built-in charging cable. There’s almost no suspension to speak of, so you’ll feel every bump and lump thumping up through that plastic body, but the Ami genuinely is quite good fun to drive, and it’s still rare enough that everyone who sees one smiles at it. The best bit is how easy it is to thread through town, and you’ll be searching out London Cabs to show off that you can turn even more tightly than they can, thanks to the Ami’s tiny 7.2 metre turning circle (a Cab takes 7.6 metres to turn around). Few things are as much fun as flinging an Ami around a mini-roundabout. OK, so the Ami is tiny, noisy, impractical, slow, and won’t actually go very far. Which makes it sound like the worst car ever. And it is, if you compare it to a similarly-priced second hand small hatchback, but that’s not the point. The Ami is designed specifically for short hops, around town, using minimal resources. It’s not a proper car, but it is really good fun. Like the look of the Ami? Why not check out the latest Citroen deals for a great price, or browse used examples for sale from a network of trusted dealers. Want to sell your car first? Well, carwow can help with that, too."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/citroen/c1-airscape,Citroen C1 Airscape Review and Prices,"£10,945",6/10,"The Citroen C1 Airscape first appeared in 2006 and in 2018 it got a small refresh. Admittedly, the exterior changes are limited to some new badges but thanks to three new paint shades there are now 32 different combinations for the exterior look. The theme of personalisation continues inside where you’ll immediately spot the brightly-coloured central console that holds the standard-fit 7-inch touchscreen infotainment. You can connect your Apple or Android device to the system and enjoy sat-nav and other features. But, it’s still a touchscreen, making it a tad tricky to use while driving. You won’t be stretching out in the front of the C1 Airscape and the rear seat space is very tight for adults. However, the driver can at least find a comfortable driving position thanks to a good range of adjustment, so the C1 isn’t so bad if there’s only two along for the ride. It only takes a few bags of shopping to fill the C1 Airscape’s boot, and you’ll be using the back seats as extra storage for anything like a weekly visit to the supermarket. You can fold the seat backs down and enjoy a pretty large luggage area for the size of the car, but if you want something more practical, have a look at the Hyundai i10. If you’re looking for the most affordable drop-top, the C1 Airscape is a fair shout. Just don’t plan on taking back-seat passengers very often. Unlike the i10, you can only get the C1 Airscape with one engine – a 1.2-litre petrol making 72hp. That’s pretty weedy even by small car standards, and you’ll find yourself driving the C1 Airscape like your hair’s on fire just to keep up with traffic. Driving like that inevitably makes the fuel economy plummet so if you want to get close to the official average fuel economy of 69mpg be ready to have a long trail of cars behind you waiting to overtake. Put simply, The C1 Airscape is a car that’s designed to excel in tight city streets. Drive the C1 Airscape at anything more than city speeds and you’ll hear lots of wind noise which makes it tiresome on long journeys. On the upside, the suspension does a good job of ironing out bumps in the road. So, if you’re set on the looks, want to drive with the roof down as frequently as possible without spending a huge sum of money, then the C1 Airscape is a fair choice. However, bare in mind that there are better open-tops such as the Mazda MX-5 for not much more money, and better city cars for less such as the Skoda Citigo."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/citroen/c4,Citroen C4 Review & Prices,"£19,940",7/10,"The Citroen C4 looks like nothing else on the road, and depending on your taste that may be a great starting point. It’s the size of regular family hatchbacks such as the Volkswagen Golf and Kia Ceed , but it has chunky styling and a slightly raised body - so you may instead be shortlisting it alongside compact SUVs such as the Ford Puma , Peugeot 2008 or Volkswagen T-Cross . It’s a bit like a British Indian takeaway - perfectly comfortable being a fusion of two things. It’s not authentically a hatchback or an SUV, but unless you’re really into labels, does it really matter? And like those takeaways, it can be great value, with a starting price that comfortably undercuts many key alternatives. The C4 was launched in 2020, and its mid-life facelift went on sale in early 2025. The most obvious change was to the styling - Citroen rebranded itself during the pre-facelift model’s life, and so the latest cars wear the newest Citroen roundel at the front. They also get new slim LED headlights with multiple daytime running light stripes, while around the back there are squarer LED taillights and the Citroen wordmark spelled out across the boot lid. Inside, it’s pretty much business as it was before - but there are new seats with better support in the corners, an updated infotainment system and a new digital gauge cluster to replace the old car’s fairly basic one. In practicality terms, the Citroen C4 is closer to a hatchback than an SUV. Though it’s slightly taller than something like a Volkswagen Golf, that doesn’t really equate to increased interior space, and legroom in the back is only just about okay for adults. The C4’s 380-litre boot is a decent size, matching the Golf, but much smaller than a Ford Puma or Peugeot 2008 - you can blame the stylish, swoopy roof line for that. The interior does feel built down to a price, but considering the C4 costs nearly £5,000 less than the equivalent Volkswagen Golf you can forgive a few areas of scratchy plastic. What’s more important is that it’s easy to use, and here it’s a mixed bag. Technophobes will love that Citroen’s retained a full set of physical climate controls underneath the main screen, as well as physical buttons for things like the drive modes and on the steering wheel. You even get an easy shortcut to turn off the more annoying driver assistance features. However, the infotainment screen isn’t quite so straightforward. There are quite a lot of menus to dive through, and functions aren’t always where you’d expect them to be. The C4 comes with a choice of petrol or hybrid engines - there’s also an all-electric e-C4 , which we’ll cover separately. All offer good fuel economy and plenty of performance, considering the C4 is quite a lightweight car. But the hybrid engines are much noisier than the ones in a Toyota Yaris Cross , and the sole petrol offering comes paired to a pretty clunky eight-speed automatic gearbox. To drive, it’s quite interesting - because so few cheap cars focus on comfort any more, instead fitting stiff suspension and big wheels to improve looks and handling. The result is that the C4 feels wallowy and awkward if you’re trying to sling it down a back road, but on the flip side it’s superbly comfortable on the motorway and deals with lumps,, potholes and speed bumps around town better than anything else this side of a luxury car. There’s no denying the C4 won’t suit everybody, then, but if it sounds like your cup of tea why not check out our best Citroen C4 deals here? You can find a used Citroen C4 for sale here, or check out other used Citroens for sale here.

However, it isn’t as spacious or as practical as some of the alternatives, like the Renault Captur. Where it’s streets ahead of those models, though, is that no other car provides more comfort per pound than the Citroen C4 Cactus. The combination of its sofa-like seats and clever suspension means you glide you up the road, totally relaxed. When the first Citroen C4 Cactus was launched back in 2014, it was genuinely unique, a model that didn’t look like any other Citroen, let alone anything from another car maker. Its flat face, novel light layout and door-mounted Airbumps (plastic cladding that warded off chips and scrapes) made it stand out in any car park, but when this revised version of the car appeared in 2018, many of those stand-out features were toned down and, in some cases, gone completely. However, it’s still a distinctive car that allows plenty of personalisation. Not only is there a wide range of body colours to choose from, you can also add various combinations of coloured highlights, alloy wheels and roof bars to make your Cactus very much your car. Inside, though, the 2018 update brought in far less change, and the slick, minimalist dashboard, free-standing touchscreen infotainment system and upwards-opening glovebox make it feel more special than most small family cars. You even get seats with a special foam filling that Citroen claims makes then more comfortable than ever. As a result, you’ll have no trouble getting comfy, and the Citroen C4 Cactus’ relatively high roof means you get plenty of headroom – even if you’re very tall. The rear seat is wide enough for three adults to sit side-by-side without fighting over elbow room, but anyone over six feet tall will find the headroom tight, especially if you fit the optional panoramic sunroof. The Citroen C4 Cactus can carry a reasonable amount of luggage, too, but its high boot lip does make loading very heavy items more difficult than in other family cars. Thankfully, there’s still space in the boot for a baby buggy and you can fit in a bike once you’ve folded the back seats down, although they don’t sit completely flat. The C4 Cactus’ name might suggest it’s some kind of prickly desert-bound off-roader but in fact it’s a comfortable and economical two-wheel-drive family car If you plan on regularly filling the rear seats and boot – or doing plenty of long journeys  – you should consider a diesel engine. The BlueHDi model will have no trouble pulling you and four friends up a steep hill and it’s fast enough to keep up with motorway traffic. Spend more time driving in town? Then, pick a petrol engine instead. The mid-range 110hp unit gives the best balance of performance and running costs, but you should avoid the cheaper 82hp version, which simply isn’t quick enough. Whichever engine you pick, the Citroen C4 Cactus will be comfortable to drive. Other than the most basic Feel Edition, every model comes with a clever suspension system that helps it iron out potholes better than almost any other small car. You also get thick glass in the windows and windscreen to help keep down wind noise at speed. The car is also pretty relaxing to drive around town. Its raised ride height gives you a good view out and the fairly light controls help you fight your way through traffic and squeeze into tight parking spaces without breaking into a sweat. Despite what you may think, though, no Cactus comes with the option of four-wheel drive. If you do need to take your Citroen C4 Cactus away from Tarmac, consider the optional Grip Control system – an advanced traction control system that comes with all-season tyres and gives the car some degree of ability off-road. Pick a top-spec Flair model and you’ll also get all the latest high-tech equipment to keep you safe, including automatic emergency city braking that’ll help stop the car quickly if it senses an obstacle ahead. All in all, this makes the Citroen C4 Cactus a well-rounded family car that’s certainly worth a look if you want to stand out from the crowd without sacrificing everyday practicality."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/citroen/holidays-campervan,Citroen Holidays Review & Prices,"£58,335",Not found,"Perhaps the way the Citroen Holidays is badged will catch on in the wider world. We might yet end up with the Skoda School Run or the Audi Business Meeting. In the meantime, the appropriately-badged Holidays is Citroen’s entry into the dealer-ready camper van market. Previously, only three car makers had offered turn-key camper vans direct from their dealers — that’s Volkswagen with the three-strong California range, Ford with the Transit-based Nugget, and Mercedes with the V-Class-based Marco Polo. Now, Citroen is joining the fray meaning that you can buy a ready-to-go camper directly from a dealer, with no need to buy a van and then take it to be converted elsewhere. The big benefit to that is that all of the interior fixtures and fittings are specifically designed for the car. Okay, so that means you won’t have as many options for custom-fittings to your own taste, but it also means that everything should work properly, and it all comes with a manufacturer’s warranty. To turn the SpaceTourer MPV (itself based on the Citroen Relay panel van) into a Holidays camper, Citroen has enlisted the services of camper vans expert Bravia Mobil. Together, they’ve stripped out the SpaceTourer’s seats and installed a kitchen with a two-burner gas hob, a 16-litre fridge, and a retractable table. There’s a pop-up roof which means you can stand up in the back when parked up, and that roof also contains a double-bed, which folds down for use at night. There’s also a ‘downstairs’ bed, as the two-seat rear bench folds flat and converts into a comfy double. Of course one of the restrictions of any similarly-sized camper van is that you can only carry as many people as it will sleep, so four — including the driver — is your limit. Cleverly, Citroen has retained the SpaceTourer’s twin sliding side doors — one on each side — for the Holidays, and has designed the kitchen unit so that it be removed for cooking outdoors, which should cut down on any lingering sausage smells inside. There’s also a 10-litre fresh water tank and a 10-litre waste water tank, which should keep you self sufficient for a while, but it’s worth noting that the Ford Nugget offers a 33-litre water tank. There’s also no on-board toilet, although in fairness none of the Holidays’ direct rivals offer that either — you’d have to upgrade to a considerably more expensive VW Grand California for that. There’s a bracket on the side of the roof which can hold a foldaway awning, and for chilly camping nights there’s a Webasto central heating system, powered by a rechargeable 95-amp/hour leisure battery, so you won’t even need to hook up to the campsite’s electricity. As standard, the Citroen Holidays comes with a 180hp 2.0-litre BlueHDI diesel engine, driving the front wheels through an eight-speed automatic gearbox. That makes it a long-legged and economical companion, but Volkswagen offers you the option of plug-in hybrid power for the Multivan-based California camper, while Ford offers the same option for the Transit Nugget. Up in the driver’s cab, the Citroen gets a fairly small — and somewhat fiddly — 10.0-inch touchscreen with Apple CarPlay , Android Auto , and built-in navigation. There’s a ‘Top Rear Vision’ reversing camera too, which makes getting into tight spaces a bit easier, while the overall height of 1.99 metres means that the Holidays should fit under most height restrictors. For safety’s sake, there’s also adaptive cruise control and emergency braking with pedestrian and cyclist detection. Fancy this smart campervan for your getaway?

https://www.carwow.co.uk/citroen/c5-aircross,Citroen C5 Aircross Review & Prices,"£24,685",9/10,"While most other family SUVs seem determined to put the ‘sport’ into Sport Utility Vehicle, the Citroen C5 Aircross stands out from the crowd by being unashamedly comfort-focused, with a generous sprinkling of chic style thrown into the mix. It’s a bit like a pair of designer jogging bottoms hanging up in a shop full of polyester tracksuits. And just like the countless leisurewear options at your disposal, if you’re looking for a family SUV at Citroen C5 Aircross prices, you’re spoilt for choice. There’s about a dozen that range from the practical and affordable Skoda Karoq and Nissan Qashqai , to the premium-but-not-quite Peugeot 3008 and Volkswagen Tiguan . Budget stretches further? The posh BMW X1 and Audi Q3 enter the mix. Despite all this choice, the Citroen C5 Aircross marks itself out from the gaggle. It's so good we awarded it Highly Commended in the Comfortable Cruiser category of the 2025 Carwow Car of the Year Awards . The C5 Aircross has chic styling, with soft edges where most alternatives offer sharp angles. Soft does not mean dull though, because it has an upright front end that gives it real presence and chunky body cladding that results in cute-off-roader vibes, with a 2023 update bringing an even classier look. It’s stylish inside, too. The dashboard design doesn’t quite give off the upmarket ambience of an Audi or BMW , but you get big, comfy seats and there’s loads of space and storage in the front. It’s not all rosy though, because while the digital displays are big and easy to read, the infotainment isn’t the most intuitive to use. Headroom is a bit tight in the back, too. Fortunately there’s a big boot to make up for this, and the rear seats can slide forward for more boot space and less legroom if required. With the seats forward, nothing else can match the space on offer, but even in the regular position you only get more capacity in the Hyundai Tucson and Kia Sportage . There’s a bit less space in the plug-in hybrid , but again, it’s more than other hybrids you might consider. This means you don’t need to sacrifice much practicality for the frugal hybrid, which will offer the lowest running costs if you can keep the batteries topped up. Don’t have access to a charger? You might consider the mild hybrid, or the diesel if you do a lot of long-distance driving. If you do spend a lot of time behind the wheel, the C5 Aircross is a comfortable companion, thanks to the big, cosseting seats and soft suspension. This is also noticeable around town, where the high driving position and large windows give good visibility, though this comfort focus does mean it rather lumbers through corners. A SEAT Ateca is more fun on a countryside jaunt, for sure. That’s not really what this big, comfy Citroen is all about, though. While its chunky buttons and occasional scratchy plastics mean you won’t immediately confuse it with a posh German option, it’s less expensive than those cars and feels well-made. It’s also really practical and if you don’t need your family SUV to do an impression of a sports car from time to time it’s a lovely thing to motor round in. Sound like your cup of tea? Check out the latest Citroen C5 Aircross deals available through Carwow, or get a great price on a used C5 Aircross from our network of trusted dealers. You can also browse other used Citroens , and when it’s time to sell your car , Carwow can help with that, too."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/citroen/c3-origin,Citroen C3 Origin Review & Prices,"£18,025",6/10,"The Citroen C3 Origin is a stylish alternative to small cars such as the Vauxhall Corsa or Kia Rio . If those cars are a practical rucksack, the C3 Origin is more like a funky messenger bag. You might be curious about the 'Origin' part of this car's name. For most of its life, this car's been known simply as the C3, but Citroen wants to reserve this name for the upcoming all-electric e-C3 . This version of the C3 has thus been renamed the C3 Origin so it can stay on sale for a few more months, filling the gap in Citroen's model line for an inexpensive hatchback. The exterior has a bit more style then your standard city car, and there are plenty of personalisation options on offer such as two tone paint and various decals to help you stand out. The stylish bag theme carries over to the interior, where you have some leather-looking straps to close the door. Some models come with wood-effect trim on the dashboard as well, and it’s a welcome addition to the otherwise quite drab-looking cabin. The material quality isn’t up there with the likes of the Volkswagen Polo either. There are a lot of scratchy plastics around the place, and bits of the cabin feel flimsy. That said, the C3 Origin is more affordable than the Polo, and you do get a decent amount of equipment. All models get air conditioning, Bluetooth connectivity for your phone and cruise control . All but the entry-level car also get a 7.0-inch touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto . Space in the front of the C3 Origin is decent. There’s a good amount of adjustment in the seats, and the steering wheel can be moved for reach and height. That said, taller drivers may be left wanting a bit more legroom. The front seats are like big, comfy armchairs. They’re soft and yielding, although there’s not much lateral support to hold you in place through the bends. Things aren’t quite so comfortable in the back though. Headroom is average (and even tighter if you have the optional panoramic roof), and the C3 Origin lags behind the Skoda Fabia for legroom. In terms of interior cubbies, the C3 Origin has some decent-sized door bins and a storage area with some cup holders in front of the gearstick. There is also a slot for your mobile phone below the infotainment screen, but it’s not really big enough for larger phones with the cable attached. The small glove box is the only real let-down in terms of cabin storage. The C3 Origin has a 300-litre boot. That’s a touch smaller than the Peugeot 208 and Vauxhall Corsa, and it’s considerably less space than you get in the Volkswagen Polo. It is a bit bigger than the Ford Fiesta ’s though, and there’s plenty of space for the weekly shop or a pushchair. On the road you can tell that this car is geared towards comfort over driving thrills. It’s not as much fun to drive as a Seat Ibiza or Ford Fiesta, but the soft suspension means it deals with bumps very well, and it’s also pretty quiet on the motorway. Engine-wise, you have a choice of two 1.2-litre petrols and a 1.5-litre diesel. The more powerful of the two petrols, with 110hp, is the best all-rounder, offering zippy performance and decent economy. The 84hp petrol is a bit lethargic out of town, but perfectly capable within it. The diesel is a bit more expensive, and only really worth considering if you spend a lot of time on the motorway. There are more practical small cars out there, and the Citroen C3 Origin isn’t the most fun to drive either, but if neither of those things matter to you then it’s a comfortable and good-looking option which offers more kit for the cash than a lot of alternatives. Keen on making a C3 Origin your next car? Check out the latest Citroen C3 deals available through carwow, and on Citroen’s whole range of models, or check out the latest used Citroens available now. And if you’re selling your current car, see how you can do that through carwow too."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/citroen/c4-spacetourer,Citroen C4 SpaceTourer Review and Prices,"£21,970",8/10,"The Citroen C4 SpaceTourer is a good MPV with a great interior – the dashboard looks and feels upmarket, while the large windows give the cabin an airy and spacious feel. The three seats in the back easily sit adults and have a wide range of adjustability. The boot, meanwhile, is one of the biggest in class. If you’re not familiar with the SpaceTourer name, it used to be called the Citroen C4 Picasso. Comfort is a very sought-after characteristic when choosing an MPV and the Citroen C4 SpaceTourer has the most cosseting ride in its class. It’s also quiet at motorway speeds, but tends to roll a bit in corners. There is a broad choice of engines for the Citroen C4 SpaceTourer – all are modern and refined and, in the case of the diesels, very cheap to run. The 115hp diesel is recommended by experts for it’s impressive fuel economy, while if you plan to only travel short urban trips, then the 130hp petrol makes more sense. Equipment levels are generous with entry-level cars getting air-conditioning, all-round electric windows, a seven-inch touchscreen infotainment system and a panoramic windscreen as standard. The C4 SpaceTourer is a stylish MPV with a slightly unintuitive interior The new Citroen C4 SpaceTourer marks a big improvement over its predecessor. Not only is it a striking looker both inside and out, but Citroen has made further strides in quality. The low weight helps improve fuel economy (along with a range of frugal engines) and importantly, it’s comfortable and spacious. If you don’t need more than that – and relish a bit of French style – it’s possibly the car for you."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/citroen/c3-aircross,Citroen C3 Aircross Review & Prices,"£20,605",8/10,"The Citroen C3 Aircross is a really difficult car to classify. Technically, it’s a seven-seater SUV, but if you compare it with cars like the Volvo XC90 or Skoda Kodiaq you’re going to be confused. That’s because the C3 Aircross packs all seven of its seats into a body that’s barely 10cm longer than a Volkswagen Golf . It’s over a foot shorter than the aforementioned Kodiaq, and shares its mechanicals, interior, styling and technology with the bargain-priced Citroen C3 . So if a Skoda Kodiaq is a holiday in Centerparcs, the C3 Aircross is like finding your own cabin on Airbnb instead. You’re probably going to pay a lot less, but you’ll likely have a much less polished experience. Outwardly, you won’t notice much difference between the C3 Aircross and the regular C3 hatch. You get the same upright, boxy silhouette, with quite a rugged-looking front grille and headlight arrangement which gives it much more of an SUV flavour. They flank a massive Citroen roundel, which definitely helps the front of the car stand out. Two-tone paintwork, plastic cladding on the wheelarches and chunky bumpers add to the beefy, off-road aesthetic. The differences from the regular C3 come once you get to the rear, where you’ll find more of the body overhanging the rear wheels and a longer roofline - hinting at the Aircross’s greater practicality. The greater interior space has been put to use in one of two ways. You can get a five-seater version, which has much more legroom than the regular C3 and a much bigger boot - 460 litres, versus just 310 litres in the regular hatch. The really interesting thing is that you can get a C3 Aircross with seven seats. This makes it the smallest and one of the cheapest seven-seaters on sale, and an alternative to cars like the Dacia Jogger or Citroen’s own Berlingo . Seats six and seven have precious little space for adults, but they’ll suit children very well. The main issue with squeezing so much passenger accommodation into such a small car is that when all seats are in place, the boot’s basically nonexistent. Forget a suitcase - you’d struggle to fit a picture of a suitcase in there. Up front, the dashboard is the same simplistic affair as the regular C3. The minimalist digital instrument panel is nice and clear and while the infotainment system is basic it does offer pretty much everything you really need. You can choose between a standard petrol engine with a manual gearbox, or a hybrid engine which comes with an automatic. Neither are particularly quick, but the hybrid has more low-down grunt and would feel more up to the task of ferrying seven passengers around. There’s also an all-electric e-C3 Aircross (reviewed separately) which comes as a five-seater only. If the idea of a pint-sized seven-seater grabs you, then check out our best Citroen C3 Aircross deals on Carwow here. You can see other great Citroen deals here, or find a used Citroen for sale here. And remember that Carwow can even help you to sell your old car when the time comes."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/citroen/c1,Citroen C1 Review and Prices,"£9,350",6/10,"The Citroen C1 is a small city car with funky styling and a colourful cabin. It’s an alternative to other city cars like the Volkswagen Up!, Renault Twingo and Hyundai i10, as well as its sister cars – the Peugeot 108 and Toyota Aygo. As you can see from the pictures, it’s a bright and cheerful little thing, but what these photos don’t show is the sheer range of colours you can choose from. And, that’s before you start to consider the options of a contrasting colour for the roof, or replacing the roof with a retractable canvas roof. Inside, too, you can choose from a variety of colourful options that give the cabin a youthful look and feel. And, if you can’t make up your mind, there are some special editions that make all the important style-related decisions for you. If that sounds good to you, and want to get offers from our trusted Citroen dealers, we’d recommend the 1.0-litre petrol engine with Urban Ride trim. Click the link, choose your colour, hit the Get offers button and see how much you could save: Citroen C1 1.0 Urban Ride . With a large central touchscreen that can be linked to a smartphone fitted to all but the most basic models, the C1 also looks pretty modern, but none of this can hide the fact that the car is built down to a price. The quality of the materials and the construction is not up with what you can find in the Volkswagen Up, for example. On the other hand, there is plenty of space in the front – perhaps more than you might expect, given how small the car is. The driving position is fine, too, but it’s worth noting that the steering wheel adjusts only for height, not reach, and the driver’s seat has no height-adjustment on the most basic version. It’s in the back where the Citroen C1 has to give second best to many of the alternatives. Both the Kia Picanto and Hyundai i10 have much more room in the rear seats, with legroom particularly in short supply. Headroom is also pretty tight, and worse in models with the retractable canvas roof. The boot, too, is smaller than you’ll find in, say, a Volkswagen Up, while the high lip makes it awkward to load and unload luggage. With a cheap car like the C1, it’s easy to focus on how little it can cost, but don’t. You’ll get a much better car if you spend a little bit more on it If you spend most of your life in town, the C1 will suit you down to the ground. It’s a light car, so it feels pretty nippy, even with a 1.0-litre three-cylinder engine; and, because it’s so small and has light steering, a tight turning circle and good visibility, it’s easy to manoeuvre and can dive through traffic. For the same reasons, it’s quite fun to drive on a twisty B-road. However, if you need to take to the highway rather than the High Road, the C1 isn’t as good as the likes of the Up or i10. Although it can cruise at the motorway limit, it makes a lot of noise getting – and staying – there. It’s also far less comfortable at these higher speeds, with the suspension letting passengers feel lots of bumps in the road. There’s only one engine to choose from, but with almost every trim level, you can pair it with either a manual or an automatic gearbox. The manual is the better bet, but both combinations return official fuel economy of more than 50mpg. Overall, the car is cheap to run – if a little more costly to insure than the Up and Skoda Citigo – but the most basic models don’t have much equipment at all. The basic trim is the only one without air-conditioning, DAB radio and the central touchscreen, as well as missing out on practical touches like a height-adjustable driver’s seat and split-folding rear seats. On the other hand, the safety package is pretty good, with Citroen somehow managing to squeeze six airbags into the tiny cabin, while you also get stability control and ABS. Overall, there’s certainly something very appealing about the characterful and colourful C1, but there are lots of arguably better alternatives. To some eyes, the Citroen’s sister cars, the Aygo or 108, may be better-looking, whereas the Up and Citigo are much more grown up and more capable beyond the city limits."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/citroen/c5-x,Citroen C5 X Review & Prices,"£31,355",9/10,"If you can’t make up your mind about what type of car you need, then the Citroen C5 X seems to offer a bit of everything. You could say it’s a bit like ordering the ‘special’ fried rice from your local Chinese takeaway. There’s a bit of bulky SUV in the mix, as well as a dash of practical estate and sleek hatchback – all of which combine to make a concoction that maybe doesn’t look immediately appetising at first glance, but is actually rather delicious when you tuck in. Given the weird mash-up, the alternatives you might also consider are pretty varied. Price-wise, everything from a Cupra Formentor to a Volkswagen Tiguan or a Skoda Superb Estate might also be on your shopping list; but the Citroen’s quirkiness certainly does at least help it to stand out from the crowd more than those models. It looks pretty distinctive on the inside, too. Soft, spongy leather upholstered seats mix with wood-effect trims and soft-touch plastics to lend the C5 X an appealing lounge-like ambience. Meanwhile, the infotainment system looks good and is easy enough to use – but it’s not the most responsive set-up in the world and you’ll possibly just default to using Apple CarPlay or Android Auto anyway. There’s loads of adjustability in the driving position, and the second row of seats is cavernous – even taller adults will find they’ve got a good amount of space to play with to get comfortable. There are a number of handy door bins and cubby holes for stashing your various odds and ends away, and the 545-litre boot is easily large enough to carry a couple of bulky suitcases and plenty of other luggage. As far as engines go, you’ve currently got three different options, although fans of Citroen’s famous diesels will be disappointed, and there’s no manual option either. Two are petrol motors, developing 130hp and 180hp respectively, and which drive the front wheels through an eight-speed automatic transmission. Then there’s the 225hp plug-in hybrid model, which combines a petrol engine with a larger battery and a secondary electric motor for an official all-electric range of 34 miles – though you’ll get much less than that out in the real world. This model makes the most sense if you are a company car driver as there are big tax benefits, although it’s not the most competitive tax rate thanks to the relatively low electric-only mileage. It’s also a bit pricier than the petrol models, so makes less sense as a private car. Our favourite is the 180hp petrol model. The engine is generally quiet and refined at a cruise, but at lower speeds the transmission can be a bit jerky. The stop-start system that cuts the engine when you’re at a standstill can be a bit over-eager too, occasionally causing you to lurch to a sudden halt as you’re pulling up to the lights. The C5 X’s ride is however extremely comfortable, bringing back fond memories of classic big Citroens. Around town you sail over lumps and bumps in the road, and on the motorway you feel like you’re wafting on a cloud. Visibility out the back isn’t great, but there isn’t much wind or road noise, and adaptive cruise control (standard on the range-topping model) helps to make long-distance journeys even less taxing. It’s even pretty fun on a twisty back road, which is surprising given the car’s spongy, souffle-like suspension set-up. There’s a bit of roll through corners , but this movement feels very controlled, and the lightweight steering is accurate enough. So if you can get onboard with the slightly marmite styling and quirky convention-busting is-it-an-SUv-or-estate-ness, there’s a huge amount to like about the Citroen C5 X. It’s super comfortable, impressively spacious and usefully practical. To find out how much you could save when buying through Carwow, check out the latest Citroen C5 X deals.

https://www.carwow.co.uk/citroen/e-c3-aircross,Citroen e-C3 Aircross Review & Prices,"£23,095",8/10,"The Citroen e-C3 Aircross is, in a nutshell, a slightly larger version of the regular Citroen e-C3 . While the petrol-powered C3 Aircross can be had with seven seats, that’s not an option for this EV variant, so you can consider it a bit like an estate car version of a regular hatchback - though it can’t carry any more people, it has more space in the back seats and a bigger boot. Like the regular C3, it’s also remarkable value, coming in at less than £23,000 - making it cheaper than any other electric car of this size. It’s like shopping at the cash ‘n’ carry, where you can get big packs of all your household favourites for not very much money - the flip side is, they’re often slightly less desirable than the name brands and might taste a bit funny if you don’t readjust your expectations. The first thing to adjust is your expectations of the e-C3 Aircross’ electric range. While other electric SUVs are increasingly bringing 200 or even 300+ miles of range to the table, for the e-C3 Aircross that figure is just 188 miles according to official tests - about 11 miles less than the smaller, lighter e-C3. Range: 188 miles (WLTP) Efficiency: 4.3 mi/kWh Battery size: 44kWh Max charge speed: 100kW Charge time AC: 0-100% in 6 hours (7.4kW) Charge time DC: 20-80% in 26 minutes (100kW) Charge port location: Left rear Power outputs: 113hp However, even though that number is pretty unimpressive, there’s a lot about the e-C3 Aircross that makes up for it. First, the practicality. The C3 Aircross is still a small car, despite its chunky-looking SUV proportions and raised ride height - but it’s only 10cm longer than a Volkswagen Golf hatchback . Despite this, you get nice spacious rear seats with plenty of room for adults, and a 460-litre boot - for reference, a regular family SUV like the Nissan Qashqai has 504 litres of space. There’s a lot to like about the interior of the e-C3 Aircross, too. Though it’s undeniably built to a price, Citroen’s been very clever in how it uses materials - a nice-feeling steering wheel and some neat fabric trim across the width of the dash mean it feels more expensive than it is. You get a fairly basic touchscreen infotainment system, but wireless smartphone connectivity comes as standard, so you can bypass it. To drive, the e-C3 Aircross feels a lot like the regular e-C3 - it’s just a little bit bigger and heavier. Citroen has fitted its clever ‘Advanced Comfort’ suspension which does a good job of ironing out bumps in the road, but the extra weight over the standard car does mean it’s not quite as comfortable. If you want a roomy, cheap, electric SUV, your options are few and far between. Alternatives include the closely-related Vauxhall Frontera Electric , which feels more conventional than the e-C3 Aircross - that might be to your taste, though. There’s also the Hyundai Inster , which offers better range and a flexible interior for a bit more money, or the BYD Dolphin , which has a similar amount of rear seat space but in a standard hatchback body.

Based on the regular C4 , which is already a sort of halfway house between hatch and SUV, the C4 X adds more fuel to the fire with a fully separate saloon boot. This might sound antiquated, and it certainly harks back to days past when the default family car was something like a Ford Cortina. It’s like a re-release of a classic record player, but with Bluetooth and MP3 functionality slightly uncomfortably grafted on. The C4 X (and the C4 hatch) both received a mid-life facelift in early 2025, upgrading their tech levels and ushering in a new look. Conceptually, there’s nothing much like the C4 X - the only other small saloon cars on sale are from premium brands such as the BMW 3 Series - but if you want something that has jacked-up suspension and a sleek silhouette, you might look to the Renault Arkana , Volkswagen Taigo or Peugeot 3008 . In all aspects other than its boot, the Citroen C4 X is the same as the regular Citroen C4. So let’s start with the point of difference - the load area. You get a huge 510 litres of load capacity, which is much bigger than the paltry 380 litres of the C4 hatchback. But what you gain in capacity you lose in flexibility. The C4 X’s boot lid doesn’t open wide enough to allow you to load big, bulky items, and while you can fold the rear seats down for longer loads you still have a fixed parcel shelf which limits you from carrying anything taller than about two feet. So while it’s great for soft bags or loads of supermarket shopping, if you want to take your old appliances to the tip, you’re out of luck. In the cabin, the C4 X has the same dashboard as the C4 hatchback, with a 10.0-inch infotainment screen and 7.0-inch driver display. They work well enough, though the infotainment system can be slightly labyrinthine in terms of where functions are hidden in the menu structure. In the back seats, you get slightly more headroom than the C4 hatchback, though legroom and width are identical. The rear backrest is also ever-so-slightly more reclined - by a whole degree - but you won’t mistake it for the back seat of a Mercedes S-Class anytime soon. In terms of engines, the C4 X is really easy - there’s only one available. It’s a 1.2-litre petrol with a hybrid system, and it replaces both the old 1.2-litre non-hybrid petrol and the 1.5-litre diesel that was previously available. It provides reasonable performance and good fuel economy, though it’s not as efficient as the Renault Symbioz’s hybrid engine - or as nice to drive. There’s also a fully-electric Citroen e-C4 X available, but we’ve covered that in a separate review. What all versions of the C4 X do get is partially hydraulic suspension, which makes it very comfortable over bumps.

https://www.carwow.co.uk/citroen/grand-c4-spacetourer,Citroen Grand C4 SpaceTourer Review and Prices,"£19,645",7/10,"The Citroen Grand C4 SpaceTourer is a roomy seven-seat MPV with a massive boot and an eye-catching design that helps it stand out from the likes of the Volkswagen Touran, Kia Carens and Ford S-Max. The current model was launched in 2013 but received a few styling tweaks in 2016 to keep it looking fresh. If you are unfamiliar with the name, it used to be called the Citroen Grand C4 Picasso. Thankfully, Citroen didn’t change too much of the old car’s already futuristic interior. You get plenty of plush plastics dotted around its minimalist cabin and the same neat central speedometer. It certainly feels more special inside than the comparatively bland Touran, but its confusing infotainment system can’t hold a candle to VW’s super-intuitive touchscreen. Sure, you get sat-nav and smartphone mirroring as standard in all but entry-level Touch cars, but the sluggish menus and fiddly on-screen buttons for the climate control make it quite tricky to use on the move. What the Citroen C4 Grand SpaceTourer lacks in easy-to-use infotainment, it claws back in passenger space. There’s room for six-foot-tall adults to sit in all three rows (for short journeys at least) and you can fit a child seat to each of the separate sliding middle seats. The futuristic-looking Citroen C4 Grand SpaceTourer makes other boxy MPVs look like they belong in an episode of the Flintstones Sadly, it’s not all good news. Folding the Citroen C4 Grand SpaceTourer’s middle and rearmost seats down is much more difficult than in the VW and Kia. Thankfully, once you’ve faffed about with the many tethers and carpeted covers you’ll open up a huge boot that’s streets ahead of the Touran and Carens. If you plan to regularly fill your Citroen C4 Grand SpaceTourer’s seven seats or do plenty of long journeys, you’ll want to pick a 120hp 1.6-litre diesel model – it’s cheaper to buy and more frugal than the bigger 2.0-litre diesel. If short trips around town are more your thing, the 1.2-litre petrol will be right up your street. Whichever model you pick, you’ll find the Citroen C4 Grand SpaceTourer easy to drive. Its huge windows and light steering make it relatively easy to thread through tight city streets – for a bulky MPV, at least – although it isn’t as comfortable as the VW and leans more in tight corners. It might not come with quite the same amount of high-tech safety kit as the Touran but the more affordable Citroen Grand C4 SpaceTourer is still a safe and hugely practical large family car that’ll be just as happy on the school run as it will be helping you move house."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/citroen/c3,Citroen C3 Review & Prices,"£18,305",8/10,"The Citroen C3 has been totally reinvented, and this is it - Citroen’s new budget competitor taking aim at some of the cheapest cars on sale today. Despite this, it’s one of the best small cars you can buy. It’s available in all-electric form as the brilliant e-C3 , but this review focuses on the petrol and hybrid models, simply known as C3. Confusingly, the old C3 remains on sale for a while - it’s been renamed C3 Origin . This all-new model is built on a cheap set of components originally designed for developing countries. But with clever design, and by loading it with generous standard equipment, Citroen’s managed to make the C3 feel rather more than the sum of its parts. It’s like creatively decorating using exclusively IKEA furniture - the components might be cheap, but with some smart touches you can have a really effective result. If you’re looking at the C3, chances are you’re considering other low-priced alternatives such as the Dacia Sandero , the Kia Picanto or even the outgoing Citroen C3 Origin. The new C3 has a boxy body and rides high - like a compact SUV . This means it has plenty of interior space - two adults can sit comfortably in the rear, and the 310-litre boot is a very respectable size, comparing favourably with some hatchbacks costing much more. The dashboard is also largely a triumph. Citroen’s managed to mask its use of inexpensive, scratchy materials with a fabric strip running across the middle that not only looks cool but brightens up what would otherwise be a sea of black. The 10.3-inch infotainment screen may not be the most high-definition, or run the very latest software, but it does just about everything you’d reasonably want - and it’s bang up-to-date with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity allowing you to circumvent Citroen’s own interface if you so choose. Comfortable seats, great visibility and a very clear digital screen for driver information are all great additions too. The C3 is powered by one of two engines. At the entry level, there’s a 1.2-litre petrol engine which gets a five-speed manual gearbox - good for an easy 50mpg fuel economy. Performance is relatively modest with just 100hp on tap, but it’s much quicker than most cars of this price. Later on in the C3’s life Citroen will launch a hybrid model . This also has 100hp, but gets an automatic transmission and should return even more impressive economy. If this sounds like the budget model for you, then check out our best deals on the Citroen C3 - or find a great deal on another Citroen model . You can also browse our used Citroens for sale , and remember that when the time comes you can even sell your car right here on Carwow through our network of trusted dealers."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/citroen/spacetourer,Citroen SpaceTourer Review and Prices,"£39,385",6/10,"The Citroen SpaceTourer is a very practical MPV with enough space in its van-shaped body for as many as nine people. If you don’t fancy moonlighting as a minicab driver, you can get it with five seats and an absolutely vast boot. Unlike the similarly named Citroen C4 SPaceTourer, the non-C4 model isn’t a stylish MPV with space-age looks. Instead, the Citroen SpaceTourer is a boxy van-based MPV with unassuming styling and a back-to-basics cabin. In this sense, it’s quite similar to the Peugeot Traveller – both come with a very high roof and large rear doors that slide rather than swing open to help passengers climb in easily. Speaking of passengers, you can carry between four and eight friends in the Citroen SpaceTourer, depending on how many seats you choose to have fitted. Even in nine-seater mode, there’s enough space for tall adults to get comfy and even those in the rearmost seats won’t feel too claustrophobic thanks to the Citroen’s large windows. Not convinced? You can also get mid-range models with a panoramic glass roof to let even more light into the back seats. Even with most of your extended family onboard there’s plenty of space left over in the Citroen SpaceTourer’s boot for a few suitcases. You won’t feel left out in the front either, because there’s plenty of head and legroom and you get a 7-inch touchscreen infotainment system to keep you occupied in all but entry-level models. You won’t buy the Citroen SpaceTourer because it looks great or feels posh, but you might part with your cash if you need to carry eight friends and their luggage without breaking the bank. Sure, it doesn’t look as sharp or as colourful as the system you get in a Mercedes V-Class, but it comes with a DAB digital radio and lets you connect your phone using Bluetooth and MirrorLink so you can use your phone’s navigation apps through the Citroen’s built-in screen. All the Citroen SpaceTourer’s controls feel reasonably solid, but the more expensive Mercedes V-Class has it beaten in terms of both build quality and plush-feeling materials. You sit just as high up in the Citroen SpaceTourer as in the Mercedes V-Class though, so you get an equally commanding view out over other cars. The Citroen’s steering is fairly light too, so it isn’t particularly taxing to manoeuvre through city streets on in heavy traffic. It doesn’t feel quite as perky as the more powerful V-Class when you accelerate hard, though, but most of the Citroen SpaceTourer’s 1.6- and 2-litre diesel engines are still punchy enough to pull you and eight friends along at a reasonable lick. The Citroen’s slightly more economical than the Mercedes, but is a little noisier at motorway speeds. To help make it a bit more relaxing to drive, you’ll want to pay extra for the optional adaptive cruise control and automatic emergency braking upgrade. This also helps make the Citroen SpaceTourer safe, and well worth a second look if you’re after a very practical MPV – especially if you need to carry as many as eight passengers. Check out our Citroen SpaceTourer deals to see how much you can save on one."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/citroen/c3-picasso,Citroen C3 Picasso Review and Prices,"£13,475",4/10,"Step inside and the unusual forms will take your attention from the iffy build quality and the multitude of buttons festooned on the dashboard. Space for passengers is around class average and the boot is big and practical enough for family needs. In terms of engines, you get a duo of fairly small and underpowered units so expect middling performance and fuel economy. The pick of the range is the 100hp diesel, but it’s still fairly slow next to rivals. You won’t need much performance anyway because the C3 Picasso rolls too much in corners to be enjoyable. At least at slow speeds the ride is cosseting and there’s hardly any road noise entering the cabin at speed. Equipment levels are a bit old school so you get air-conditioning and cruise control as standard, but an infotainment system is a £800 option even on the top-spec model. It's a good family car if you simply detest compact SUV crossovers If you need the versatility of a small MPV but want to stand out in the crowd and look stylish then the Citroen C3 Picasso is hard to beat."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/citroen/e-c4-x,Citroen e-C4 X Review & Prices,"£28,715",7/10,"The Citroen e-C4 X is an electric car that doesn’t fit easily into one category. Like the petrol-powered C4 X , it’s quite an unusual combination of traits, merging the high ride height of an SUV, the silhouette of a coupe, the price tag of a small hatchback and the saloon boot of, well, a saloon. It’s a bit like an old cottage that’s been refurbished, adapted, built on and extended until there’s not much of the original left - while the e-C4 X is related to the regular Citroen C4 hatchback , it’s a very different proposition. The e-C4 X, like the rest of the Citroen C4 range, got a mid-life facelift in 2024. The most noticeable change is to the front-end styling, which is much sleeker than it was before and features multi-level LED daytime running lights and narrow LED headlights. Though it’s not exactly handsome, it’s distinctive, and from the rear three quarter it’s almost elegant. Citroen’s new, much larger badge leaves you with no confusion about what brand it’s from. As an electric family car, there are a lot of excellent alternatives to the Citroen e-C4 X that you might be considering. Budget offerings such as the MG4 or great electric SUVs such as the Kia EV3 spring to mind, but finding a direct alternative isn’t easy because of the Citroen’s unique silhouette. Other electric saloons on sale tend to be more luxurious offerings such as the BMW i5, though the Tesla Model 3 is a good-value alternative. Inside, the e-C4 X is very similar to the rest of the C4 family. Since the 2024 facelift, it gets a new, posher infotainment screen and higher-quality digital dial display, but the bones of the cabin are the same - which means you get plenty of physical switchgear for ease of use, a simple and quite classy design and surprisingly good build quality for such a cheap car. Space for passengers is nearly identical, with rear seats that are just slightly reclined from the C4 hatch, but the boot is totally different. At 510 litres in capacity, it’s massive, but being a saloon car with a fixed rear window you lack flexibility for carrying larger items. The e-C4 X is fitted with Citroen’s ‘Advanced Comfort’ suspension, which has clever hydraulic elements. All you really need to know is that it deals with lumps and bumps in the road very well, taking the edge off speed humps and potholes in a way that most cheap cars don’t. There are two battery and motor combinations available for the Citroen e-C4 X, linked to the trim level you select. Base-model Plus variants (the even cheaper ‘You!’ model available on the standard C4 isn’t an option here) get a less powerful motor and a battery capable of up to 221 miles between charges (officially). Meanwhile, the top-spec Max model gets a larger battery and more powerful electric motor, good for up to 262 miles between charges and with improved performance. Both models are as smooth and quiet to drive as all electric cars, but while they’re nippy enough around town you don’t ever really feel a surge of acceleration like you do in a Tesla Model 3. Combined with the e-C4 X’s soft suspension, this is a car better suited to relaxing drives rather than extracting every drop of performance down a back road. If all this sounds good, check out our best Citroen e-C4 X deals . You can also see other great Citroen deals , or if you’re buying secondhand, find a used Citroen e-C4 X for sale or see other used Citroen cars for sale .

https://www.carwow.co.uk/citroen/berlingo,Citroen Berlingo Review & Prices,"£23,320",6/10,"The humble van-based MPV is something of a dying breed these days, with a lot of buyers moving towards SUVs instead. The Citroen Berlingo is here to fly the flag for the boxy people carrier, offering a massive boot and loads of cubby spaces inside. You can think of the Berlingo as being like a pair of cargo trousers. It’s functional, comfortable and practical, if not the most on-trend option on the market. There’s no hiding the fact that the Berlingo is based on a van, but Citroen has made a few changes to spice things up for this passenger version. You have a different bumper with split-level headlights and range-topping models get smart-looking alloy wheels. This car is pretty much identical to the Peugeot Rifter and Vauxhall Combo Life under the skin, but the Citroen is arguably the most distinctive. The Berlingo’s commercial vehicle roots are also apparent on the inside, where there’s not much in the way of plush materials. Go for the entry-level Feel model and you’re greeted by a swathe of hard black plastic across the dashboard, although the Flair XTR does add a pop of colour to the otherwise bland cabin. All models get an 8.0-inch touchscreen as standard, which helps to keep things looking modern. There’s plenty of space up front, and you get loads of adjustment in the seat to make yourself comfortable behind the wheel. What’s surprising for a car like this is the rear legroom, because there’s not that much of it. The back seats are also quite upright, so they’re not the most comfortable on long journeys. What’s not lacking in the back is headroom thanks to that boxy body, and there’s more than enough shoulder space to fit three across the back as well. The main reason you’ll buy this over something like a Citroen C5 Aircross or Kia Sportage is the boot, because it’s gigantic. You get a whopping 1,255 litres of space back there. That’s a huge increase on the 580 litres you get in the C5 Aircross. You have three engine options to choose from. If It’s petrol power you’re after, there’s a 110hp option with a six-speed manual gearbox. There are also two diesel options, one with 101hp and a six-speed manual, or a 130hp engine with an eight-speed automatic. No matter which engine you go for, the Berlingo is pretty easy to drive. The tall driving position and vast windscreen give you a great view out, and the big, van-like door mirrors make it easy to see behind you as well.

https://www.carwow.co.uk/citroen/e-spacetourer,Citroen e-SpaceTourer Review & Prices,"£37,560",Not found,"The Citroen e-SpaceTourer is the ideal vehicle for someone who needs to take a lot of people a decent distance, and doesn’t want to be hassled with the noise and fuss of an internal-combustion engine. The e-SpaceTourer is a sister vehicle to the Peugeot e-Traveller minibus, and comes in two forms – Business costs £45,600 (after the government plug-in car grant), and Feel will set you back a post-grant £46,250. A 50kWh battery brings a range of 143 miles, and you can recharge it using either a three-pin wall socket (slow), a 7.4kW home wallbox (0-100% in 7.5 hours), an 11kW workplace wallbox (0-100% in around five hours) or a public rapid charger (up to 100kW), which will give you an 80% charge in around half an hour. The clue is in the Business trim name, because it’s aimed at commercial users. It can carry up to nine people, although the seating can be configured in a very short period for your own needs. Feel, meanwhile, is available as a five-, seven- or eight-seater. It is aimed at large or extended families, groups and those who like to travel with friends. The sliding seats allow you to change the interior for optimum boot volume or more legroom for those who want it. The seats have reclining backrests and can each be folded down to form a flat ‘shelf’ (front passenger seats as well as Rows 2 and 3), making it possible to transport the most bulky objects for leisure or home use in no time at all. There’s a new MyCitroen smartphone app that allows you to monitor charging remotely, pre-warm the car, find your e-SpaceTourer in a car park, and tell you when its next service is due. Citroen has also formed a partnership with PodPoint in the UK for the supply of wallboxes either at home or work. Better still, there’s an extended five-year warranty on these for Citroen customers. The Citroen e-SpaceTourer is no plodding bus, either, because it has a top speed of 80mph from its 100kW electric motor. The drive can choose between three drive modes. First up, Eco lessens the power of the air-conditioning system and reduces the motor’s power output to 60kW to maximise range. restricts acceleration and reduces heating and air-conditioning power in order to maximise range, Normal allows the motor to produce 80kW and is a balance between Eco and Power, which allows the motor to produce its full 100kW for driving enjoyment and overtaking. The motor recovers energy under braking or during deceleration. Two energy recovery modes are available to the driver – ‘Standard’ for a feel close to that of a conventional engine, ‘Enhanced’ for increased deceleration when releasing the accelerator pedal. This latter mode is accessible via the ‘Brake’ button on the gearbox control. UK e-SpaceTourers will be 4.95 metres long, and will have a 3.27-metre wheelbase. Five-seat models will have 2,381 litres of luggage space available when all five seats are filled. We have yet to drive the Citroen e-SpaceTourer but will let you know what it’s like as soon as we do.

https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/x5,BMW X5 Review & Prices,"£68,135",10/10,"There aren’t many cars that can do what the BMW X5 can do: it’s like a roomy, comfortable hot hatch on stilts. It’s genuinely enjoyable to drive, much more so than alternatives such as the Audi Q7 and Mercedes GLE . If you want to get something closer, you’ll need to head to a Porsche Cayenne , but that’s a bit like a 100-metre sprinter at a marathon – it isn’t quite as comfortable or practical for families over long distances - which helped the BMW X5 to win the Adventurer's Choice category of the 2025 Carwow Car of the Year Awards . The BMW X5 has most cars very much licked on the luxury front, though. Everywhere you prod there are luxurious materials and soft-touch plastic, from the top of the dashboard to the door tops. Sure, the overall design is slightly more conservative than that of a Mercedes GLE, but for some, that’ll be a good thing, and an update in 2023 brought a much more modern design to close the gap. You get BMW's excellent twin-screen setup on the dashboard. The curved displays look suitably modern, with the one on the right displaying all the relevant driving information and the one on the left for your infotainment.  It's a touchscreen and really quick to respond to your inputs, but the menus are quite complicated to find your way around. Another important factor in a large luxury SUV is space and the BMW X5 offers plenty of it. Those in the front will have no complaints and the driver gets a supportive seat with full electric adjustment and a memory function. There’s plenty of space in the back seats, as well – two tall adults will sit comfortably behind those in the front, while a third won’t be sounding off on a long journey either. That spaciousness continues to the boot, with the X5 having 650 litres, which is a good chunk less than you get in an Audi Q7 and Porsche Cayenne, though the BMW is a bit more spacious than the Mercedes GLE. There are four engines to choose from. The plug-in hybrid will be the best option for those who can charge regularly, and it also has the lowest tax rate for company car buyers. There's a sporty petrol if running costs aren't a concern, but most people will find one of the diesels offers the best all-round experience. In town, the BMW X5, despite its size, isn’t daunting to manoeuvre thanks to good visibility for the driver through its tall wide windows and standard front and rear parking sensors. In fact, BMW includes its Parking Assistant, which will steer the car into a space for you and you can add rear-wheel steering as an option for better low-speed manoeuvrability. It’s a comfortable experience, too; the X5’s optional adaptive air suspension does a good job of soaking up ruts, potholes and broken Tarmac in its most comfortable setting. That said, the M Competition’s firmer suspension (in the name of going around corners more quickly) isn’t as comfy when the going gets rough. On twisty country roads, the BMW X5 steers with precision and on its standard suspension handles well – particularly in its firmer ‘sport’ setting. The M Competition’s still-firmer suspension props the X5 up even more effectively through bends and the range-topper is more agile to drive. But, calm things down to a cruise on the motorway, and all the engines are quiet, while wind and road noise are kept to a minimum. You do hear more road noise in the M50i and M Competition with their huge alloys and super-wide tyres, though. So, if you’re convinced the BMW X5 is the large SUV for you, make sure you check out our BMW X5 deals pages for the best prices, and if you want to see used X5s deals on Carwow.

https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/ix,BMW iX Review & Prices,"£70,995",9/10,"This big, striking SUV is the BMW iX, the German brand’s biggest electric model and an alternative to other luxury SUVs, such as the Polestar 4 and Mercedes EQE SUV . You might also consider it as a posher alternative to the Kia EV9 if you don’t need all that space. An electric family SUV isn’t a particularly wild concept these days, but it seems no one told BMW’s designers. Like so many of the brand’s other cars, the iX has a really striking exterior design. It’s a bit like Marmite – you might love it, you might hate it, but it’s hard not to have an opinion either way. From those sharp lines and creases on its bonnet and wheelarches; to its big alloys, massive, toothy grille and squinty headlights – it’s certainly a very busy-looking design. In white in particular, you could say that it looks like someone crashed the Space Shuttle Discovery into the back of some sort of giant robotic beaver. Someone should probably tell NASA… Its dimensions are more conventional, being roughly comparable to the current X5 SUV on the outside, but with an interior that’s closer to the bigger X7 in terms of the space. And while you won’t get the option of seven seats on this new electric SUV , its cabin doesn’t skimp on any sense of luxury, tech or eco appeal. Range: 259-377 miles Efficiency: 2.8-3.1 miles per kWh Battery size: 74kWh / 108kWh Max charge speed: 250kW Charge time AC: 11hrs, 0-100%, 7kW / 16hrs 15mins, 0-100%, 7kW Charge time DC: 31mins, 10-80%, 250kW / 35 mins, 10-80%, 250kW Charge port location: Right rear Power outputs: 322hp / 516hp / 610hp That tech appeal is emphasised by a pair of huge screens that dominate the cabin. The 12.3-inch instrument panel and 14.9-inch infotainment display combine almost seamlessly to look like one big, curved display – it's an impressive sight from behind the wheel. You get a wireless charge pad, multiple USB-C ports and a range of connected services too. Build quality is top notch, and it’s very practical too with lots of space for five adults to stretch out. Boot space could be a bit more generous, though. With a 500-litre capacity, there’s less room for bags than you’ll find in the Polestar 4. You can choose from three power outputs, depending on whether you are happy with a quick car or you feel the need to warp the fabric of space and time. All three have an electric motor at each axle for all-wheel drive and a battery pack housed low down beneath the floor. The entry-level 326hp xDrive40 model has an official range of up to 264 miles, while the 523hp xDrive50 has a bigger battery that will see it travel up to 383 miles on a charge. If that’s not quick enough for you, the iX M60 has 619hp, a range of up to 349 miles, and a 0-60mph time of under four seconds. The cars have slightly different maximum charge rates (150kW for the xDrive40 and 200kW for the xDrive50 and M60), but the long and short of it is that any iX will be able to use a DC rapid charger to go from 10-80% capacity in less than 40 minutes. Plug in at home with a 7kW charger, and a full recharge will take up to 16 hours. Whichever model you go for, the BMW iX is one of the best electric SUVs to drive. It might be big, but excellent visibility makes it pretty easy to navigate tight city streets, while the air suspension on xDrive50 models smooths out bumps in the road for a comfortable drive. Out on the motorway it's lovely and quiet, making long journeys relaxing, while each of the motor options will get you up to speed quickly. And when you take the iX down a twisty road it swaps serene comfort for surprising agility. This is still a big, heavy SUV, but it's one of the more capable electric SUVs in corners. All models have all-wheel drive, which helps offer reassuring grip as you accelerate out of bends. If this sounds like the car for you, head on over to our BMW iX deals page to see how much money Carwow can save you. You can also get a great deal on a used iX as well as other used BMWs .

https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/6-series-convertible,BMW 6 Series Convertible Review and Prices,Not found,6/10,"If you’re looking for a luxurious open-top that’s more relaxing than, say, a Porsche 911 Cabriolet, the BMW 6 Series Convertible is well worth considering. It’s enjoyable to drive, has a choice of strong performing, efficient engines and a well-equipped interior. Indeed, there are very few complaints about the 6 Series’ interior. The dashboard is angled towards the driver and the quality of materials is of a very high standard. Everything feels opulent, if maybe just a little bland, given the hefty price tag. Still, BMW’s easy-to-use iDrive infotainment system comes as standard. The BMW 6 Series’ front seats are comfortable, though, and with the roof down it remains an incredibly quiet and unruffled place to sit – there’s no raising of voices needed here. The rear seats are less impressive for adults, who’ll struggle for knee room. The fabric roof can be raised or lowered at speeds up to 19mph and four adults are well protected from the wind even at higher speeds. A decent amount of luggage can come along for the road too – the 6’s boot will take a large suitcase plus some soft bags, a large pushchair or a set of golf clubs without fuss. There are three engines to choose from, but they’re all excellent. The entry-level petrol comes in the shape of the 3.0-litre turbocharged inline-six in the slightly confusingly titled 640i. Producing 320hp, it’s a smooth performer, mellow in sound, but strong enough to overtake with confidence. It’s best to enjoy the BMW 6 Series Convertible for what it does best: cruising in the sun, roof down. If you want sports-car fun, there are better open-tops. The twin-turbo V8 650i petrol adds a little extra power, but only improves on the performance figures marginally, at the expense of almost 9mpg in fuel economy. If efficiency is a bigger priority, then the 640d – a 3.0-litre diesel producing 313hp – will be more your thing. Hardly any less powerful than the 640i petrol it’ll also manage 40mpg if driven sensibly. Its all-round ability makes it the best option for the 6 Series. All 6-Series use BMW’s slick eight-speed automatic gearbox. It shifts smoothly, rarely gets caught out and generally suits the relaxed vibe of the car very well. Convertible cars sometimes suffer from shudder where the body flexes when cornering hard or going over bumps. No such problems here – the 6-Series feels solid, but not at the expense of the driving experience. It feels nimble, too, with high levels of grip. Still, it stops short of an all-out sports car, lacking the sort of connection you’ll enjoy in a 911 Cabriolet. Comfort, Normal and Sport driving modes are available on the 6 Series, but it’s best to leave it in Comfort or Normal, as switching to Sport causes the 6 to feel unsettled without managing to achieve any noticeable improvement to how it goes around corners. So, if you’re a keen driver then there are better ways to get your kicks. But, if you rarely carry rear passengers and cruising with the wind in your hair is more your thing, then the BMW 6 Series Convertible will do a fine job. Just bear in mind that these days there are many newer alternatives with the latest tech to consider – most notably BMW’s own 8 Series Convertible."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/m240i,BMW M240i Review & Prices,"£49,970",9/10,"This is the BMW M240i, and it’s a bit like one of those ‘lite’ diet desserts. You know, the ones that promise most of the taste but without all the calories. Only for once, this ‘lite’ option really delivers. For three-quarters of the price of the utterly bonkers BMW M2 , you get 90% of the car. In fact it’s so good, it makes us wonder if anyone really needs the M2. The M240i is not just a more affordable alternative to its big brother. It's a performance-oriented coupe that rivals the Mercedes-AMG CLA 35 and Audi S3 Saloon . You could also see it as an alternative to an Audi TT or entry-level Porsche Cayman , and it picked up a 2023 carwow Buy It Award . To look at, the M240i doesn’t have the drama of some of these cars. The design doesn’t deviate hugely from M Sport versions of the regular BMW 2 Series Coupe, but there are some touches to add aggression to the M240i. Though the design doesn’t deviate hugely from M Sport versions of the regular BMW 2 Series Coupe , there are some touches to add aggression to the M240i. These changes are most obvious at the rear, with the inclusion of a new lip spoiler and a rear diffuser, plus larger exhaust surrounds. You’ll get larger intakes at the front of the car too, along with new door mirrors and 19-inch alloy wheels as standard. Similarly inside, rather than going overboard with changes to the interior, there’s a handful of tweaks to nod to the performance credentials of the M240i. The main one is a really comfy set of leather sports seats, plus some M-branded stitching in various places. Retained from the base car is BMW’s sleek iDrive infotainment system. Though it’s not the latest version as seen in the BMW iX or 7 Series , it’s still slick to use and looks fantastic. Plus, if you’d rather mirror your phone, there’s support for Android Auto and Apple CarPlay . Though there are rear seats in the BMW M240i, they’re not exactly spacious – though that’s the natural territory of a small coupe. Headroom is pretty tight because of the sloped roofline, and legroom is at a premium. An Audi S3 or Mercedes -AMG CLA 35 would serve you better if you need to carry passengers. Boot space is unchanged from the base car, coming in at 390 litres. That’s some way down on the Mercedes-AMG CLA 35’s 460 litres, and the Audi S3 Saloon’s 425 litres. The thing you’re likely most interested in is the engine powering the BMW M240i. It’s a 3.0-litre turbocharged six-cylinder, producing 374hp and 500Nm. That’s sent to an all-wheel-drive system through an eight-speed automatic gearbox, resulting in a 0-60mph time of 4.3 seconds. There’s no manual option here, sorry. Along with that beefy engine, the M240i also comes with upgraded brakes, a limited-slip differential on the rear axle and wider tyres for more grip. You can also get an excellent adaptive damper system, but it’s pricey as it’s not a standard inclusion. If you’re buying a BMW M240i, you’ve likely done so to have some fun on twisty roads. It’s a delight to report it’s rather good at that. Steering feels really precise and there’s plenty of grip, leaving you with a lot of confidence to push. You can feel the car move around a bit underneath you, but there’s never a lack of composure. Certainly an improvement over the old M240i. That capability doesn’t come at a cost when it comes to daily driving. It’s comfy and quiet when you’re at a cruise, and it’s effortless to manoeuvre around. The only real sticking point of the BMW M240i is its price. It starts around £4,000 more than a CLA 35, and £6,000 more than an Audi S3 Saloon. Plus, it’s in entry-level Porsche Cayman territory - which is hard to look beyond if you’re looking for an all-out sports car. If you’re willing to stomach the cost though, the BMW M240i is a car you should go right ahead and buy. It’s absolutely brilliant. Plus, if you want to save a bit of money on an M240i, you can check the latest deals available through carwow, and look through the deals on all BMW models .

https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/i5,BMW i5 Review & Prices,"£67,705",9/10,"The BMW i5 is a bit like an alcohol-free pilsner. You still enjoy the refreshing taste of German lager, but it’s better for you – or in this case the planet. You see, the new i5 is the all-electric version of the latest BMW 5 Series. So you can choose a traditional pilsner if you can live with an internal-combustion hangover, or pick the EV if you want to wake up feeling refreshed and virtuous in the morning. If you plan to stick with a conventionally powered BMW for a while longer, have a read of our review of the 5 Series . Here we’re focusing on the all-electric i5, and spoiler alert, it's good. The two models look broadly similar from the outside. With a smaller grille than some recent BMWs, the styling isn’t as divisive as other current Beemers. It’s a bit more understated, but it's certainly not a looker – though we have a feeling that the looks will grow on us as we become more used to the design. A slow-burner, maybe. There are two power outputs to choose from. The less powerful is the i5 eDrive40, which has one 340hp motor powering the rear wheels. Step up to the M60 for two electric motors, one for the front wheels and one for the rears. Being four-wheel drive has to be a good thing when the car has 601hp. The regular eDrive40 is quick, with a 0-62mph time of six seconds. The M60 reaches 62mph in a kidney-bruising 3.8 seconds. Both models have the same battery pack, with an 81.2 kWh usable capacity. In the less powerful, lighter model, that gives an official range of up to 357 miles, dropping to a maximum of 315 miles for the heavier range-topper. That compares with 376 miles for a Mercedes EQE 350, one of the alternatives that could be on your shortlist if you are looking for an upmarket electric saloon. Will you be able to travel that far in the real world? Well, the way you drive will make a big difference. When Mat drove the M60 in Portugal the range was closer to 200 miles, but car reviewers aren’t renowned for driving gently. Assume that’s a worst-case scenario, and the official numbers are a best case. Plenty of electric cars are fast in a straight line, but BMWs are supposed to be fun around corners as well. The i5 corners with poise, especially cars with adaptive sports suspension and active anti-roll bars. The trouble is, the i5 is heavier than the regular 5 Series saloon, weighing as much as a big 4x4 . The M60 is especially heavy, which is a shame as the car doesn’t feel as light on its feet as we’d hope. Get carried away and the front tyres push wide surprisingly early. Drive more steadily and the i5 is remarkably comfortable and super-quiet, with only a murmur of wind and road noise. Inside, the cabin is a high-tech banquet for the eyes, with a huge twin-screen display and an exceptional standard of finish. Even lower down the dash and doors there’s no sign of penny-pinching. Only the brittle action of the indicator stalks feels less than premium. There’s plenty of space front and rear, too, although the big transmission tunnel that exists for the internal-combustion-engined 5 Series gets in the way if there are three passengers in the back. The car is packed with clever tech, although frustratingly perhaps the smartest technology of all isn’t available in the UK. The optional upgrade for the adaptive cruise control available in some markets will change lanes for you. All the driver needs to do is look in their mirrors to check that it’s safe, and the car’s sensors can tell that you’ve looked to the side and will swap lanes. Where legal, the driver can even take their hands off the wheel. The eye activation feature is launching initially in Germany, the USA and Canada. A UK launch date for the automated lane-changing function has not been confirmed. So, clever, quick, and very good to drive – if not quite great compared with BMW’s greatest hits of the past. Next to other electric saloons, though, the i5 is pretty much as good as it gets, and if you need a bit more practicality, a BMW i5 Touring is coming later this year.

https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/x5m,BMW X5 M Review and Prices,"£100,535",8/10,"Putting the engine from the fabulous high-performance M5 saloon into a big 4X4 is the sort of thing you might speculate about with your mates down the pub. But BMW has actually gone and done it, and this is the result, the BMW X5 M. It rivals other high-performance SUVs, like the Porsche Cayenne Turbo, Range Rover Sport SVR and Mercedes GLE63. But, it immediately has the bragging rights, as it’s the quickest of the lot. In fact, its twin-turbo 4.4-litre V8 has an incredible 567hp and 553Ib ft of torque, which is enough to propel this 2.3-tonne brute from 0-62mph in just 4.2 seconds. That’s sportscar performance in anyone’s book, yet this car is also a luxurious five-seat SUV. The price is equally shocking, but happily this expensive car comes with lots of equipment as standard, including sat-nav, adaptive dampers (that let you stiffen the suspension), and plenty of safety equipment. The cabin is awash with airbags, and you also get active cruise-control with automatic braking, automatic headlights, tyre pressure monitoring, a head-up display, adaptive LED headlights and high-beam assist. You also get a bespoke bodykit that includes aggressive exterior styling and unique dials. In other words, the looks are every bit as brutal as the performance it’s capable of. Yet, the beauty of the car is that it can be whatever you want it to be. The standard Adaptive M suspension has separate buttons for altering the steering weight, gearbox ferocity and throttle response to allow you to tailor the X5 M’s behaviour to the conditions. With everything dialled down, this is a civilised and practical day-to-day vehicle. However, choose the hooligan settings and it’s an entirely different matter entirely. It’s probably just as well that the top speed of the X5 M is limited to 155mph, because I dread to think just how fast it could go if it wasn’t If there is a downside, it’s that the BMW X5 M could get away with being a good bit less powerful, simply because few drivers could ever push this thing to anywhere near its limits. The handling of the standard X5 already does a great job of defying the laws of physics, but the X5 M takes it to another level entirely – although it’s still not quite as sharp as a genuine sports car through the bends. Oh, and there is one other possible downside: its fuel economy. Even the official figures reckon it’ll only manage 25.4mpg, so quite what that will translate into in the real world is best left to your imagination. Then again, if good fuel consumption figures were a priority, you wouldn’t be looking at the X5 M in the first place. Instead, this is an expensive SUV that is as luxurious as it is quick. It comes with Merino leather upholstery, while the graphics on the infotainment system are some of the clearest you can find on any system at any price. The BMW X5 M is also as practical as any X5, and nobody sat inside this behemoth is going to complain about a lack of leg or head room. Last, but not least, although the boot isn’t as big as you’ll find in the Mercedes GLE, it’ll still be more than enough for most people. Likewise, the boot isn’t the biggest in this sort of vehicle, but the X5 M has 650 litres of boot space, which should be enough for most families. And, if it’s not, it’s expandable to 1,870 litres if you fold the back seats down. This is the kind of thing that starts to build a case for buying the X5 M over a sports car with similar levels of performance. Just try getting five people and their luggage into something like a Jaguar F-Type, for example. For all that, it’s hard to make a case for the X5 M on purely financial terms. It’s big, brash, in-your-face and very expensive, but if you can afford one, you won’t give two hoots about the price ticket or how much it costs to keep it on the road."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/m3-touring,BMW M3 Touring Review & Prices,"£91,775",9/10,"The BMW M3 Touring is a car almost perfectly designed for petrolheads. It’s fast, it’s fun, it’s an estate car , and it’s not really all that practical for day to day life. It’s kind of like trying to do the weekly shop by driving a go-kart around the aisles of your local Tesco — fun at first, but you soon start to realise it’s not all that sensible. There are some other options in the hot estate class, too, such as the now-sadly-departed Audi RS4 Avant and the Mercedes-AMG C63 Estate and the much smaller, but still rapid CLA AMG 45 Shooting Brake . There’s also some internal competition from the BMW M340i Touring , which is slower, but rather more affordable and useable without sacrificing too much fun. Look at the M3 Touring from the square-on at the front, and you won’t see any difference compared to the M3 saloon . There are the same massive nostril grilles (which were once incredibly ugly but which now seem to be mellowing a bit) and the same deep front bumper and air intakes. A 2024 update brought with it some minor tweaks under the skin, but the only discernible changes are the narrower LED running lights, flat-bottom steering wheel and the latest generation iDrive infotainment system - complete with its curved screen setup. Down the sides, while the estate bodywork is clearly lifted from the standard BMW 3 Series Touring, the M3 Touring has clearly been hitting the gym to bulk up those wheel arches, and there’s a massive rear diffuser with four exhaust tips around the back. You can slather lots of the outside with carbon fibre if your chequebook runs deep enough. The Touring shares all of its mechanical bits with the M3 Competition saloon , so there’s the same 3.0-litre twin-turbo straight-six petrol engine, which has recently been upgraded to 530hp as standard (up from 510hp before), with standard xDrive all-wheel drive. If you’re feeling a bit fruitier, you could go for the M3 Touring CS, introduced after the 2024 update. It gets another 20hp, bringing it to 550hp, along with tweaked suspension, gold alloy wheels and those iconic CS yellow LED headlight details - as well as a very flash carbon fibre bonnet. As with the saloon, four-wheel drive is now standard, with the old rear-wheel drive model having been dropped. The four-wheel drive system does have a sneaky cheat switch though, which allows you to lock it into rear-drive mode for tyre-shredding skids, but maybe leave that setting for when you’re on a race track, eh? Either way, you can’t do that with an Audi RS4. The M3 Touring’s suspension comes with adaptive suspension dampers, so when you set those to the softest setting, it’s actually fairly comfortable in day to day driving, with just a bit more stiffness over bumps than a standard 3 Series. The view out, especially over the shoulder, is good and there are plenty of parking sensors and cameras to make in-town manoeuvres that bit easier. Inside, the M3 Touring is basically the same as the saloon, so you get the same big sweep of digital dashboard with its massive screens, and the same very high quality construction. There’s lashings and lashings of carbon fibre, and you can have the same carbon-backed bucket seats as you can get in the saloon. These clamp you in place like a racing seat, but they’re not quite as comfy on a long drive as the standard chairs. The big curved screen has impressive software, but BMW has been steadily stripping out physical buttons from the 3 Series’ interior, so there are no longer any proper air conditioning switches, and that makes things more annoying to use than they should be. A Mercedes C-Class has a cabin and screen that’s easier to get used to. Space in the back seats is good, and basically the same as that of the saloon model, just with a little bit more light coming in through the extra window. The reason for buying the Touring over the M3 saloon is, of course, the boot space which is 500 litres, 20 litres more than you get in the saloon, and  five litres more than in the old Audi RS4 Avant. The M3 Touring also keeps the classic separate opening tailgate glass, sadly dropped by the new M5 Touring , which is really handy.

https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/2-series-convertible,BMW 2 Series Convertible Review and Prices,"£26,455",7/10,"The convertible BMW 2 Series is a great-looking and fun-to-drive open-top, with all the style and panache of alternatives like the Audi A3 Cabriolet. It may have expensive additional extras and cramped back seats, but there’s no doubt that you’ll have fun with this car when you’re behind the wheel. At the front, there’s the usual BMW scowling headlights and iconic ‘kidney’ grille. The grooved doors lend a sporty look to the sides, while the rear is angular and modern, completed by that singular chrome exhaust pipe. Things take a turn for the worst when you put the roof up, though. The soft top looks uneven against the smooth lines of the rest of the body – it’s a bit like doodling a beanie hat onto the Mona Lisa. The interior of the Convertible is mostly good, too, taking many cues from the regular BMW 2 Series Coupe. The build quality is magnificent all-around, with everything feeling well-put-together, while the dashboard is intuitively laid out. However, space in the rear seats is limited, to the point where a full-sized adult would struggle to squeeze into the back. However, if you’re in the market for a sporty, performance-orientated convertible such as this, the back seats probably aren’t high on your list of priorities. If you just treat the 2 Series like a two-seater for yourself and one passenger, you won’t find any problems. I had a lot of fun with this car. It drives well (even though the regular 2 Series is a little better) and looks amazing. The top-of-the-range trims can get pretty costly, though. The 2 Series Convertible’s infotainment is your standard BMW fare, using the firm’s iDrive system. You get a 6.5-inch digital screen with satnav, automatic emergency services alerts and a DAB-, CD player- and MP3-compatible radio. Other features found on every model include automatic air conditioning, automatic headlights and a Bluetooth hands-free system. Forking out an extra £1,000 for the Sport trim will give you sports seats and let you select driving modes, adjusting the steering and suspension for Sport, Comfort and Eco functions. The M Sport trim goes even further by improving the suspension, enlarging the wheels and reupholstering the steering wheel. The top-spec M240i’s biggest change is swapping the standard engine for a turbocharged, six-cylinder petrol, armed with 340hp and a 0-62mph time of five seconds – but you pay an awful lot for the improved performance. Both petrol and diesel engines are available, with the latter being more economical, yet also noisier, cramping the otherwise sporty image of the 2 Series Convertible. Driving the convertible 2 Series is a good time all-around. From the steering to the gear changes – whether manual or automatic – to the suspension, everything feels smooth, fluid and unintrusive. While the stiffer 2 Series Coupe still feels slightly better to drive, the Convertible doesn’t give too much away and feels more agile than an Audi A3 Cabriolet. And while the car’s folding roof might not be beautiful to behold, it does do its job well. It can shift position in less than twenty seconds and still works in speeds of up to 31mph. So, if you’re on the hunt for a sleek, cool convertible that drives and handles well, the BMW 2 Series is well worth looking at. Make sure to check out our deals pages for the best prices."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/x2,BMW X2 Review & Prices,"£42,750",7/10,"The BMW X2 marks a dramatic departure from the previous model. The old X2 looks relatively plain and almost hatchback -like, but this new X2 gets sharper styling with a fastback rear and chunky sides, plus a big grille which optionally lights up at night. It won’t be to everyone’s taste, but it’s certainly more striking. Underneath, it’s using the same mechanical bits and pieces as the taller, more practical X1 , so swapping to an X2 is a bit like kicking off your wedges and strapping on some stilettos — you can walk in both, but one is much more stylish than the other. There are several other sharply-styled SUVs you could consider, too. There’s the Audi Q3 Sportback , the Volvo EC40 , the Lexus LBX , and the incoming Renault Rafale . The X2’s cabin is, of course, largely shared with the X1 and that means you get the impressive-looking curved screens atop the dashboard, which includes a big central infotainment screen and a digital instrument panel. A head-up display is also optional. For the most part, the cabin looks and feels quality, but there are some unpleasantly cheaper materials if you go looking. You do have to get used to operating almost everything through the touchscreen - including the climate controls and even some of the headlight controls, which is really annoying. But that’s a criticism that can be laid at the door of many of the X2’s alternatives. Surprisingly, the X2 doesn’t compromise its practicality too much compared to the X1. Yes, the sloping roof does mean that you can’t pack in big boxes like you can in the X1, but the actual boot volume below the luggage cover is slightly better. Space in the back seats is also fine, although you will notice that there’s less headroom and less light coming in than in the X1. You can choose from two petrol-engined options for the X2. There’s an entry level X2 20i, which uses a 2.0-litre turbo four-cylinder engine driving the front wheels through a seven-speed automatic gearbox. There’s also the X2 M35i, which also gets a four-cylinder turbo 2.0-litre engine, but which is amped-up to 300hp and has four-wheel drive and lower, firmer suspension. There’s also the all-electric BMW iX2, with a choice of two power outputs - we’ve reviewed this separately here .

https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/xm,BMW XM Review & Prices,"£110,840",6/10,"If you’re after a high-performance SUV , you’re currently spoilt for choice. Porsche, Lamborghini, and even Tesla have produced performance SUVs, but BMW’s M division was yet to have a proper go – until now. This is the BMW XM. Soon to be tussling with the Ferrari Purosangue , Lamborghini Urus Performante, Porsche Cayenne Turbo GT and Tesla Model X Plaid , the BMW XM is the first M Division -only car since the 70s (Yes there are other M-labelled SUVs – like the X5 M and X6 M – but the XM is an M-exclusive model) and it’s again jumping on current trends – this time it’s big, brash SUVs. It’s like deciding which bubble tea flavour to go for – all have different characteristics and suit different people. Where the XM certainly divides opinion is how it looks. It’s not a pretty car, to be blunt, with BMW doubling down on the huge kidney grilles, which now come with lights on the inside. You also get split headlights at the front, while you get a squarer design down the side. You can choose between 21-, 22- and 23-inch alloys – with the larger ones likely to fill the arches better – while the blocky design continues at the rear. You get thin taillights, quad tailpipes, a rear diffuser and BMW logos etched into the rear, all adding to the sporty nature. The cabin is much less controversial. It’s tidy, modern and features a sweeping screen holding both the driver’s display and infotainment touchscreen. You can get tasteful all-black or less tasteful two-tone upholstery to adorn the cabin alongside many other M features to make it even more obvious that it’s a special model – like the steering wheel-mounted M buttons and M-specific gear lever. With its square body shape and measuring 5.1m long, there’s loads of head and legroom, making it good for those wanting to carry passengers for the day-to-day family commute or for a fun countryside blast. The boot is 527 litres, which compared to its main rivals is about average. The Tesla Model X Plaid has over 1,100 litres with five seats in place, while the BMW also falls behind the Porsche Cayenne Turbo GT (549 litres) and Lamborghini Urus Performante (616 litres). It only beats the Ferrari Purosangue , which has a 473-litre boot. From launch, the plug-in hybrid XM will come with a 4.4-litre twin-turbocharged V8 paired with an electric motor developing 653hp and 800Nm of torque. The sprint from 0-60mph takes just 4.3 seconds and it can reach a limited top speed of 155mph. That limiter can be raised to 168mph. But if you want BMW’s most powerful road car ever in its punchiest form, you’ll want to wait for the Label Red version. It uses the same setup, but power is upped to 748hp and 1,000Nm of torque, promising even more impressive performance. The hybrid system for both includes a 25.7kWh battery pack that delivers up to 55 miles of electric-only driving. Charging on AC only, its max charging rate is 7.4kW and it takes a little under four and a half hours to fully charge. When you drive on electric, you do get less punch than you get with the petrol engine involved, but it makes town driving very easy. The steering is responsive and light enough, while the suspension soaks up most bumps and cracks in the road. There’s limited tyre noise from the huge wheels and the overall refinement is excellent, making long-distance driving a relaxing affair. Having the hybrid setup helps with fuel consumption, but it’ll be nowhere near BMW’s claimed figure of 188.3mpg because most won’t charge the electric system up often enough. To make sure it doesn’t feel too firm when you’re driving this 2,710kg SUV, BMW has fitted its adaptive M suspension setup so you can soften the ride for longer drives, and firm it up when you want to attack a road. However, you still feel a lot of lean on twistier roads even with this harder setup. There is plenty of performance offered by the 653hp power system, but when going for harder acceleration, the automatic transmission is hesitant to respond quickly enough, which takes away from the experience a little. You can fix this by using manual mode, but this issue makes it feel less like a flagship M car. While there are some admirable features that make the XM a cool car, it lacks some of the excitement of its rivals and doesn’t quite live up to the flagship M car billing as many would have hoped. If you’re after a great deal on a new XM or other new BMWs , you should use carwow – and if you want to change your car altogether, you can sell your car with us to help put money towards your next one. We also provide plenty of used deals on BMW models , where you can get a great price for the car you want."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/x1,BMW X1 Review & Prices,"£36,430",8/10,"The BMW X1 is the baby of the Bavarian brand’s SUV range, headed by the enormous X7 seven-seater . It may still be the entry level SUV model, but the current model is far removed from the awkward-looking compact SUV-inspired hatchback the X1 once was. Think of it as the youngest sibling in a large family. It’ll always be seen as the little one, but now it’s grown out of puberty, graduated university and it should be taken seriously. And the X1 really has grown, not just in character but in size being larger in every direction than the model that came before it. It’s a much better looking car now, with a bluff front end sporting a pair of squared-off grilles and aggressive headlights. It’s a boxy car all round, looking even larger than it is with sharp angles and crisp lines all over - especially in M Sport trim, whereas xLine cars ditch the aggressive body kit in favour of tough looking black cladding. The interior of the X1 is sleeker than the exterior, with a pared-down dashboard featuring a prominent pair of screens in a single wide display. They’re crisp and easy to read, but the infotainment menus can be a little overwhelming to use. BMW has opted to get rid of physical climate control buttons and use touch controls on the 10.7-inch screen instead, but it’s rather fiddly to use on the move. Otherwise the cabin layout is easy to navigate and pleasant on the eye, with minimalistic shapes and contrasting trims across the width of the dashboard to break up the design. Gone is the traditional gear level, with a tiny gear selector switch in its place instead. Space is good in both the front and back of the X1, especially with the sliding reach bench set all the way back. Tall adults won’t struggle for headroom and legroom at any position, though boot space is maximised with the bench all the way forwards. The X1 beats its German alternatives for boot space, at 540 litres versus the Audi Q3 ’s 530 litres and the Mercedes GLA ’s 495 litres - though the Volvo XC40 has the X1 licked with its 578-litre boot. BMW has given its small SUV a wide range of engine options, with the cheapest being the entry-level petrol model. There are fuel efficient plug-in hybrid options and a range-topping M35i high-performance model. All X1 models are good fun on a twisty road, but being a BMW it’s hardly a surprise. There’s little in the way of body lean when attacking corners and the steering isn’t too light for decent grip feel. It’s definitely sportier than alternatives such as the VW T-Roc and Skoda Kamiq . The M35i model is a cut above, but that’s to be expected with its BMW M135i roots. Motorways are a little noisier than you might expect from a posh SUV with some noticeable wind and road noise - especially on the larger optional wheels. In town the X1 can get shaken up over broken roads, but good all-round visibility, automatic gearboxes and a small turning circle make city driving a breeze. The X1 should be at the top of your list for a premium small family SUV, and you can check out Carwow’s BMW X1 deals here. If you know you want a BMW but you're not sure on the X1, have a look at other new BMW deals instead. You could also browse used X1s or other used BMW deals too. Carwow can even help you sell your car when the time comes."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/4-series-gran-coupe,BMW 4 Series Gran Coupe Review & Prices,"£46,825",8/10,"If you’re after a sporty-looking car that offers some extra practicality, the BMW 4 Series Gran Coupe is worth checking out. If you were in the market for something practical and sporty, your options used to be limited to a shooting brake-style estate, like a Volkswagen Arteon , a super expensive sport saloon ( BMW M5 anyone?) or the Audi A5 Sportback . But this updated version of the BMW could be for you. Much like the A5 Sportback is just an extended version of the regular A5 , the Gran Coupe takes the sleek, coupe styling of the standard 4 Series and adds two extra doors at the rear and a hatchback boot lid. Viewed side-on it looks properly smart, it’s just a shame its massive twin kidney grilles make it look a bit like an angry beaver up front. Compared to the previous 4 Series Gran Coupe, this version is taller, longer and wider, which helps to improve interior space. The cabin is as well-built and generously kitted out as any BMW, with soft-touch materials fitted alongside a high level of standard equipment. Inside, your eyes are drawn to the 12.0-inch digital instrument display with BMW’s latest hexagonal-like dial graphics, but it’s a pity that you might find the screen a bit hard to read. You also get a crisp 10.3-inch infotainment touchscreen that can be used with the familiar iDrive control dial in the centre console, and this works very well indeed. You’ll have no trouble getting comfortable in the 4 Series Gran Coupe, as you can get optional electric seat controls with lumbar and bolster adjustment. The sport seats that you can have fitted are a little firm on a longer drive, but they keep you very well supported. Particularly lofty adults might have a harder time getting settled in the back seats, though, thanks to the car’s dramatically sloping roofline and limited headroom. That swooping silhouette comes at a price, it seems. The boot is a good size, but it’s still smaller than in the 3 Series saloon. You have the choice of three petrol engines and one diesel, all of which are paired to an eight-speed automatic gearbox. Seeing as this is a sporty-looking model, the six-cylinder M440i may be tempting as it’s very fast and refined. Saying that, the sole 420d diesel option will be the most efficient. As there are only three trims to choose from, pairing the M Sport Pro with the 420d xDrive all-wheel drive unit combines the best in efficiency and year-round practicality. With its accurate steering, it feels pretty entertaining through the corners, and although some bumps are felt at slower speeds due to the firm M Sport suspension that’s fitted as standard, it’s not unliveable with by any means. On longer drives, it settles down superbly and cruising is an absolute breeze – especially with the optional adaptive cruise control system with steering assist to help keep you in the right lane. It can feel quite large on narrower roads and between tight gaps in town, but its steering is set up so it’s nice and light at low speed – making it easier to manoeuvre. Although there are places where the 4 Series Gran Coupe may be very appealing, you can’t help but think that it isn’t quite as practical as the 3 Series , nor as sleek as the regular 4 Series Coupe. Even though it treads the line between the two well, you may feel that you’re better off with one or the other – and not a blend of the two. It’s also not the cheapest. When you tick boxes for the multiple option packs – which you probably will – prices start to get a bit silly. A lot of desirable kit – such as the top driving assistance kit and a wireless charge pad – is only available this way too, which is a bit of a pain. But if the BMW 4 Series Gran Coupe sounds like it could be the car for you, then head to our deals page to see how much you could save through carwow, or click through to our used BMW page for the latest deals on nearly new cars."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/x6-m-competition,BMW X6 M Competition Review & Prices,"£137,190",8/10,"Choosing the BMW X6 M Competition over a regular X6 is like cracking a nut with a pneumatic drill instead of a sledgehammer. The cooking version is already quick, dramatic, and luxurious. The M Competition takes those qualities – in particular performance – and nudges the dial off the scale. Or to put it another way, the BMW X6 M Competition is the ultimate expression of a BMW SUV . For starters, its twin-turbocharged V8 petrol engine produces 625hp, plus it costs more than £110,000. It competes with quick sports SUV coupes such as the Audi RS Q8 , Mercedes-AMG GLE 63 Coupe and Porsche Cayenne Coupe . But, if you think performance cars should be as close to the ground as possible and have two seats, then the BMW X6 M Competition will be about as welcome as a Hawaiian shirt at a black-tie ball. You’ll also potentially be unenthusiastic about the way it looks. Let’s just say you can’t be the shy and retiring type to own one, with its gaping black grille, huge air intakes, huge wheels, large exhausts and vivid unique paint colours helping it stand out over the standard X6. And, if by some miracle you’d missed the exterior, the X6 M Competition’s interior is every bit as in-your-face. Think seriously figure-hugging seats with quilted stitching, aluminium trim, sports pedals and ambient lighting. Of course, there’s the chance to up the ante with BMW’s options list, but a superb fit and finish are standard. One thing that stays the same versus standard BMW X6 s is the infotainment system, although it’s one of the best in the business. It’s BMW’s top-end Professional system, which gets a 12.0-inch screen that can be controlled by touch, a rotary dial between the front seats or even a very good voice control system. It also gets Apple CarPlay as standard (with Android Auto to follow in time), although you’ll have to pay for it beyond year one and Mercedes’ digital dials are more visually impressive and configurable than the ones you get as standard in the BMW. Two adults in the front of the BMW X6 M Competition will have no issues with space, but if you regularly carry tall adults in the back you’ll be better off with the more upright X5 M. If, like the majority of people, you don’t, then it’ll be just fine. The boot will be too, although an RS Q8, GLE 63 Coupe and Cayenne Coupe all have a slightly larger one. Elsewhere the BMW X6 M Competition also comes as simply an X6 M with 600hp, but here in the UK it’s the full-fat 625hp Competition model or nothing. That V8 petrol sends this 2.4-tonne behemoth to 62mph from standstill in just 3.8 seconds. That’s supercar fast. And while it won’t lap a track as quickly as BMW’s fastest M cars, the X6 M Competition’s huge tyres, stiff, adaptive suspension, extra bracing and quicker steering all help it feel just about as agile as an SUV can, even without the rear-wheel steering of some alternatives. Of course, in town, this big SUV doesn’t feel quite so nimble, but on the motorway it’ll breeze down slip roads and overtake faster-moving traffic with a simple twitch of the right foot, all the while remaining more comfortable and quiet than it has any right to be given its sporty intentions. So, the first decision is whether or not a car like (and that looks like) the BMW X6 M Competition appeals to you, but if the answer is yes, then you’ll find few finer ways to go fast in an SUV . Make sure you head to our BMW deals page and used BMW page for the very best prices, and make sure you see how you can sell your car online through carwow , too."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/2-series-active-tourer,BMW 2 Series Active Tourer Review & Prices,"£34,895",7/10,"Crossovers and SUVs dominate the family car market these days, however BMW is keen to prove that the humble MPV is still deserving of a place on the driveway with the 2 Series Active Tourer. You can think of the 2 Series Active Tourer as a more sensible alternative to cars like the Audi Q2 and Mercedes GLA , and BMW’s own X1 . If those cars were a pair of trendy Nike Air Max trainers, the 2 Series Active Tourer is a sensible pair of Hush Puppies. In terms of premium people carriers, only Mercedes offers something similar, with the B-Class very much in the same mould as the Active Tourer - practical rather than fashionable for the size. It may not be as stylish as a modern SUV, but you can lift the 2 Series Active Tourer by going for the M Sport pack. This gives the car some sporty-looking bumpers, as well as 18-inch alloy wheels, making it look a bit less dowdy and a bit more aggressive. This may not hide the car’s boxy shape, but the plus side is a practical cabin. Up-front there’s plenty of headroom, as well as loads of adjustment in the seats to find your ideal driving position. You get plenty of storage, with a small cubby under the armrest as well as a big space under the centre console where you could keep a bag. The glovebox is an average size, as are the door bins. You can get a wireless charging pad in front of the cupholders, which has a helpful clip to keep your phone in place. The spacious theme continues in the rear. Headroom is still generous, and there’s plenty of knee room as well. There’s also a handy armrest with cupholders in the rear, and fitting a child seat is easy thanks to the exposed ISOFIX anchor points. As for the boot, you get 470 litres of space in the 218d models, or 415 litres in the 220i and 223i versions. Plug-in hybrid versions drop to 406 litres of cargo room thanks to a battery pack under the floor, although that’s still around the same as the 405 litres offered by the Audi Q2 . The Mercedes B-Class gets 420 litres of boot space, so slightly more than the petrol and plug-in hybrid Active Tourer, but less than you get in the 218d version. It’s worth bearing in mind however that the diesel’s additional storage space is situated under the boot floor., rather than within the main luggage area The exterior design may not be as exciting as an SUV, however the interior can easily match something like a Mercedes GLA . Everything feels really well screwed together, and the materials used are all high-quality. The overall cabin layout is very similar to the BMW X1 SUV, meaning you get the same floating armrest and wide central air vent, as well as the same 10.25-inch digital driver’s display and 10.7-inch infotainment system. Engine-wise, there are plenty to choose from. Only one of them is diesel though, the 218d with 150hp. Then there’s a couple of petrol models, the 220i and the 223i with 170hp and 218hp respectively. If you’re a company car driver, you’ll probably be looking at the tax-efficient 225e plug-in hybrid. This gets a 1.5-litre petrol engine paired with an electric motor, producing 245hp and capable of an official 56 miles on electric power alone. The plug-in hybrid makes the most sense around town, where the instant acceleration of the electric motor makes pulling out at busy junctions easy. Whichever engine you go for though, the 2 Series Active Tourer is easy to drive in the urban jungle. The BMW 2 Series Active Tourer may not be the most exciting offering in the family car segment, however if you’re looking for a well-made, premium-feeling car to haul the family around, and you’re not too bothered about looking flash while doing it, this car is certainly worth a look-in. If you’re looking to make the BMW 2 Series Active Tourer your next car, check out the latest offers available on carwow. Alternatively, you can browse used BMW models , and you can sell your car for what it’s really worth."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/5-series,BMW 5 Series Review & Prices,"£52,195",9/10,"Think of an all-rounder, and two things are likely to spring to mind. First will be a Swiss army knife – the global icon for ‘a thing that does everything’ – and the next could well be the BMW 5 Series. Since debuting five decades ago, this posh German saloon has proven time and again that it can offer comfort, bags of practicality, the latest technology and serious performance. It’s a similar story with its two key alternatives – if you’re considering a 5 Series you should also take a look at the Mercedes E-Class and Audi A6 . Or perhaps the Lexus ES if you want a left-field option. The latest 5 Series clearly takes hints from BMW’s recent bold design direction as seen on the likes of the 2 Series Coupe and XM , albeit a little more subdued. That said, its styling is rather challenging, lacking the elegance of its predecessors. There are odd, incohesive lines around the headlights and front bumper, a front grille that seemingly mimics beaver teeth and the rear end looks like the designers couldn’t agree on what to do so gave up halfway through the process. It’s a different story inside, with BMW’s latest infotainment system present and correct, combining a 12.3-inch digital drivers’ display with a 14.9-inch central screen. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are included as standard, and operate wirelessly. The overall design is pretty good and although some of the physical buttons have disappeared, forcing you to use the touchscreen more, there are high quality materials and solid build quality to make up for it. Artificial leather upholstery comes as standard, though you can opt for the real stuff, as well as a part-Alcantara choice if you’d prefer. So you get all the good tech, but if practicality is key, you might be a touch disappointed. Petrol-powered versions of the new 5 Series promise 520 litres of boot capacity, which is less than the Mercedes E-Class and Audi A6, though not by much. On the plus side, unlike those two cars the BMW’s boot doesn’t lose capacity in the plug-in hybrid version. A Touring estate version will arrive later if you need the extra room. The BMW 5 Series is available with one petrol engine, offering 208hp, and a pair of plug-in hybrid versions with up to 489hp. Notably, there’s no diesel version, which is a sign of the times given that this model is typically popular with those who rack up serious motorway mileage. It’s goodbye to diesel, but hello to electric for the first time in a 5 Series. The i5 – reviewed separately here – will do up to 361 miles on a charge, but is quite a bit more expensive than the petrol-powered model. As you might expect, the BMW 5 Series is a comfortable and refined motorway cruiser. There’s a little bit of wind and road noise but overall it’s a relaxing way to rack up miles. However, BMWs usually excel at also being great fun on a twisty road, but the latest 5 Series is a bit disappointing in this regard. The steering is numb and doesn’t give much feedback about how much grip the tyres have, while the car just generally lacks the eagerness to turn into a corner that made old versions so much fun to drive. An Audi A6 is, surprisingly, more fun here… Regardless, this is a great all-rounder and just a fraction better overall than the Mercedes E-Class and Audi A6. Want one? Check out the latest BMW 5 Series deals available through Carwow. You can also see how much you could save on a used 5 Series from our network of trusted dealers, as well as other used BMWs .

https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/8-series,BMW 8 Series Review & Prices,"£87,030",7/10,"The BMW 8 Series is a sumptuous grand tourer with a luxurious interior, four seats and a surprising turn of speed. Go for a range-topping M850i model, and this BMW has the pace to take on the likes of the likes of the V8 Aston Martin DB11 , the Bentley Continental GT and the Lexus LC . The BMW 8 Series’ interior might not have the same pizzaz as these more expensive rivals, but you still get an extremely sumptuous cabin with lashings of posh Merino leather and huge slabs of brushed metal. The tall centre console comes with a few too many fiddly buttons, but above it you’ll find a vast touchscreen infotainment display that’s one of the best around. It’s far easier to use than the clunky last-generation Mercedes system you get in the Aston Martin DB11 and it comes with some of the coolest graphics you’ll see this side of a Lamborghini – most noticeably on the standard digital driver’s display. Thankfully, the BMW 8 Series is more practical than a Lamborghini – and most other large coupes for that matter. There’s ample space in the front for very tall drivers to stretch out and you even get a pair of back seats as standard. Sure, these will be a very tight squeeze for adults but kids will have plenty of space to get comfy. There’s space in the boot for a couple of medium suitcases and you can even fold the back seats down to carry long luggage, too. This isn’t a car you’ll want to take to the tip, however – more likely you’ll be blasting down the autobahn or storming up a mountain pass on your way to the ski chalet. Speaking of which, driving the BMW 8 Series for long distances is an absolute doddle. The standard adaptive suspension does an excellent job ironing out potholes and even the most raucous M850i V8 model emits merely a whisper in eighth gear at motorway speeds. Turn onto a twisty back road, put it in Sport mode and hit the throttle and this relaxing grand tourer transforms into a surprisingly lithe sports car faster than you can say ‘hold on in the back!’. The 4.4-litre twin-turbo V8 produces a whopping 523hp which – combined with a grippy four-wheel-drive system – rockets the 8 Series from 0-62mph at a rate that’d make some supercars blush. The standard eight-speed automatic gearbox is one of the best in the business, too – shifting quickly and smoothly, no matter which of the driving modes you choose. Stick it in Sport and it’ll even sense when you’re entering a corner and prime the gearbox to deliver lightning-fast downshifts as soon as you hit the brakes. Go one step further into Sport+ mode and the standard adaptive suspension becomes firmer to make the four-wheel-drive M850i as squat and purposeful as possible. You can even get the car with an active anti-roll system that uses electric motors to physically lean the car into a corner as soon as you turn the steering wheel. Thankfully, BMW’s considered more than just what makes a car great fun to drive on a country road. The BMW 8 Series comes with four-wheel steering to help make it as stable as possible on the motorway and more manoeuvrable than its large size would suggest around town. That said, threading this imposing grand tourer through tight gaps in traffic is still a slightly nerve-wracking experience. Rear visibility is pretty poor and the small side windows don’t give you a particularly good view out. You could level these criticisms at almost every slinky four-seat sports car on sale, however, and they quickly fade into the background when you consider the BMW 8 Series’ impressive breadth of abilities. It’s an excellent long-distance cruiser yet summons up some sports car skills when you fancy having fun on a deserted back road.

https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/ix3,BMW iX3 Review & Prices,"£65,170",6/10,"The BMW iX3 is the company’s electric SUVs and an alternative to the Audi e-tron, Mercedes EQC , Ford Mustang Mach-E and Skoda Enyaq . It’s the BMW equivalent of the Monsters Inc story. Until now, the company has used scary old petrol and diesel to generate power, but now they’ve found out that laugh-a-minute electricity actually works a whole lot better for everybody, and makes you smile, too. So the iX3 is new, but just doesn’t look it. Up front, there’s the usual BMW grille, but it’s all a clever ruse because it doesn’t have to cool an engine, so it has been sealed to help reduce drag and give the car’s range a small boost. A dimpled pattern breaks up what would otherwise be a big sheet of black plastic. The 20-inch wheels are unique to the BMW iX3, too. Their heavily sculpted design helps to smooth airflow along the side of the car, improving range, although they look exceptionally vulnerable to kerbing. Assorted blue highlights to designate the electric model dotted around the iX3 – most obviously on the rear bumper where you’d normally spot some exhaust pipes – finish off the styling changes. There are also blue highlights around the ‘grille’, the badges and the sills. Under the skin is a solitary 286hp electric motor that also generates 400Nm of torque and drives the rear wheels. There’s an 80kWh battery pack that should give a range of up to 285 miles – that’s according to the latest official testing procedure. That’s a bit more than key alternatives such as the Audi e-tron and Mercedes-Benz EQC, but a bit less than the Jaguar I-Pace . In the real world it will be a bit below that, especially in cold, wet conditions. The iX3 should be compatible with almost every kind of charging station or power outlet, including super-fast 150kW chargers, which can give an 80% recharge in just 34 minutes. This means you can add 60-ish miles of range in about 10 minutes. There aren’t many 150kW chargers in the UK, but the network is growing. Range: 286 - 290 miles Efficiency: 3.4-3.5 miles per kWh Battery size: 74kWh Max charge speed: 150kW / 250kW Charge time AC: 7hrs 30mins, 0-100%, 11kW Charge time DC: 34mins, 0-80%, 150kW Charge port location: Right rear Power outputs: 282hp Charging from less powerful outlets (such as a home wall-box charger or three-pin plug) will take longer – BMW reckons a full charge from empty will take around 12 hours. While electricity prices have risen lately, they’re not rising as fast as the cost of petrol or diesel, so an electric iX3 will still be much cheaper to run than a conventional X3. All electric cars feature brake regeneration – a system that uses the electric motor as an extra brake that can feed energy back to the batteries that would otherwise be lost as the car slows down. This always happens when you press the brake pedal, but the iX3 joins many of the latest electric cars  by giving the system the ability to bring you to a stop when you lift off the accelerator pedal, too. It allows for one-pedal driving, which (once you’re used to it) is an extremely relaxing way of dealing with urban traffic. It’s not the fastest version of the X3, but it’s still pretty quick with a 0-60mph time of 6.8 seconds. Top speed is limited to 112mph, which helps to preserve range. It’s more than enough for UK drivers, anyway. The first thing you notice when you get out and about in your iX3 is how quiet it is. There’s no noise from the engine and transmission, so you only notice a little wind and road noise as your speed rises. Adaptive suspension is fitted to the iX3 as standard, so it’s pretty comfortable, although a Mercedes EQC still trumps it for out-and-out ride quality. However, the suspension stops the iX3’s body from rolling too much during cornering. The iX3 grips strongly, too, and its handling is doubtless helped by the fact that the batteries are stored in the floor, lowering the centre of gravity. Flicking the suspension into Sport model firm things up a lot, to the extent that it makes the ride too firm, but it certainly sharpens the handling and gives the iX3 a distinctly sporty feel. All iX3s are well equipped. The entry-level M Sport comes with a 12.3-inch digital driver’s display and 12.3-inch touchscreen infotainment system, wireless phone charging, electrically adjustable leather seats, adaptive suspension (which lets you choose between soft, comfortable settings and stiffer, sportier ones) and a panoramic glass roof. The top-spec M-Sport Pro car has a Harman Kardon audio system, a head-up display and an automatic parking system.

https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/4-series,BMW 4 Series Review & Prices,"£45,195",9/10,"The BMW 4 Series is an upmarket coupe that seats four and is designed to be more stylish and fun to drive than the BMW 3 Series saloon on which it’s based. It’s also more fun than its main alternatives, the Audi A5 and Mercedes C-Class Coupe . The two-door 4 Series Coupe sits in a family of 4 Series models, along with the convertible and five-door Gran Coupe models, while the BMW i4 is the electric version of the regular 4 Series Coupe, with the coupe and convertible getting updates in 2024 . But in terms of styling, if the German coupes were in an orchestra, the Audi and Mercedes would be tickling the triangle while the BMW tries its best on the tuba – that grille makes the most noise. Some will like it and some really won’t. Still, beyond that, the 4 Series is a good looking car. Its aggressive creases, sporty body kit and sloping roofline make it a sort of half-price BMW 8 Series . Inside, it’s not as in-your-face as a C-Class in terms of design, but it’s classier and the levels of quality are better than in both Mercedes and Audi. In Mercedes’ larger cars its infotainment system narrowly beats BMW’s for visual drama and the way it works, but in the 4 Series and C-Class (where Mercedes fits its older systems), it’s the BMW that takes the win. The BMW’s looks better, works better and comes with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto . Praise be. Audi’s system comes a close third on all fronts. The 4 Series has seating for four people and those in the front seats will have all the space they need. The driver gets a good amount of adjustment, but it’s disappointing that lumbar adjustment – good for staying comfortable on long drives – isn’t standard and only comes as part of a very expensive pack. Grrr. The rear seats are fine for legroom, even for adults, but they’ll struggle with head room if they are anywhere close to six foot. Getting in and out of the back is a struggle too, because there are no rear doors – but hey, it’s a coupe. Still, the 4 Series’ boot is a generous 440 litres, which is only slightly smaller than an A5’s and some way bigger than the C-Class Coupe’s. There’s lots of engine choice, and there isn’t a bad one. There are 2.0-litre and 3.0-litre petrol and diesels, ranging from 184hp to 374hp, but the majority of people will find the 184hp 420i 2.0-litre petrol a great choice. Do more motorway miles? The 190hp 420d 2.0-litre diesel will cruise more efficiently. If you want maximum punch, the M440d diesel and M440i petrol both have powerful six-cylinder engines with startling performance. Then there’s the high-performance BMW M4 , which we have reviewed separately. Handily, all 4 Series models are huge fun to drive. They’re lower and stiffer than a BMW 3 Series , and turn into corners with more agility than an A5 or C-Class Coupe. The xDrive all-wheel drive system is available with the 420d and standard on the M440 models for added security in slippery conditions, plus BMW offers things like upgraded brakes, a sports differential and adaptive suspension to really spice things up. The M models get this as standard. That agility does mean the 4 Series feels harder over bumps in town, even in its most comfortable driving mode, but otherwise, its standard parking sensors and rear camera make light work of parking. On the motorway, the suspension feels less abrupt and the 4 Series cruises quietly, but like the lumbar support, BMW’s clever adaptive cruise control with lane-keep steering assist costs a fortune to add as part of a pack. More grrr. Despite these minor setbacks, we think the 4 Series is the best of its breed. See how much you could save on a new BMW 4 Series with carwow , or check out our latest used BMWs .

https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/i4,BMW i4 Review & Prices,"£51,280",8/10,"The BMW i4 is like a 4 Series from a decade in the future. It shares a very similar outline, but uses all-electric power and has a slightly bolder design, as well as having a more advanced interior. It certainly won’t fade into the background, as BMW has fitted the huge kidney grille from the 4 Series Gran Coupe that the i4 is based on. In the cabin, the i4 has a plush finish to match other BMW models – it definitely feels more upmarket in here than a Tesla Model 3 , and can match a Polestar 2 . Entry-level models come with cloth seat trim as standard, but leather is also on offer for those wanting a high-end feel. Regardless, it’s a well-built and neatly designed cabin, but the infotainment is the star of the show and features the impressive curved display combining the 12.3-inch instrument and 14.9-inch infotainment screens in one sleek unit. Compared to the 4 Series Gran Coupe, it’s 6mm taller and sits 15mm closer to the road – but remains mostly the same. Taller passengers may struggle to fit in the rear due to the sloping roof line, but knee room is acceptable. As it’s based on a conventional fuel-powered car, there isn’t a flat floor in the footwell, so fitting three adults in will be a struggle. However, the door openings are a good size and it is more than comfortable enough. You’ll be happy to hear that it’s quite spacious in the boot, with the hatchback tailgate opening up to provide a roomy load space. The rear seats fold down to reveal a flat floor, too. The i4 comes in three versions. The entry-level eDrive35 has 282hp and claims up to 299 miles of range, while the eDrive40 ups this to 366 miles courtesy of a larger battery. That version comes with a 340hp rear-mounted electric motor setup that also produces 430Nm. The top-spec i4 M50 version – which was developed by BMW's M division – is fitted with two electric motors. With one fitted on each axle, the M50 comes with four-wheel drive and has a stout 544hp and 795Nm on tap. With the same sized battery as the eDrive40, though, claimed range is reduced to up to 318 miles. Whichever i4 you want, performance isn’t an issue. Even the eDrive35 models can do the sprint to 62mph in 6.0 seconds. But if you want brutal electric acceleration, the M50 gets to 62mph in 3.9 seconds (we bettered that in our video, however). Top speed is 140mph, though, rather than the usual 155, because the range of an EV really suffers at high speed. In town, the i4 feels very comfortable over bumps and cracks in the surface thanks to air suspension at the rear, and it’s pretty nimble as well. M50 models come with adaptive suspension for further comfort, meaning that even the higher-performance model can deal nicely with poorer surfaces.

https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/m4-coupe,BMW M4 Coupe Review & Prices,"£91,325",9/10,"The BMW M4 is a high-performance coupe alternative to the likes of the Alfa Romeo Giulia Quadrifoglio , Audi RS5 and Mercedes-AMG C63. Mechanically speaking, it’s pretty much identical to the M3 saloon but was spun off a few years ago into its own model as a sleeker coupe version of the famous 3 Series . The latest model has just as much punch as you’d expect from an M car, but brings a bit of a dilemma in design too. You see, BMW has been a bit like your teenage son or daughter rebelliously sneaking out one afternoon to get a nose piercing you’ve told them not to. It was known BMW had plans for the snarling great grille you see at the front of the M4 but, despite widespread outcry not to do it, it went ahead and put it into production anyway. Whether you love the looks or hate them, there’s more to the outlandish styling of the BMW M4 than just the ‘kidney’ (maybe lungs would be appropriate) grille. Huge intakes sit either side of the lower front bumper, while down the side swollen wheel arches make it stand out from a regular 4 Series. In fact, the only bit of bodywork shared with the standard car is the boot lid — though here it has a spoiler tacked on top. You’ll see a quad-exit exhaust sat below a carbon fibre diffuser, and happily, those huge tailpipes are real. You can choose between different alloy wheel designs, with the front pair 19 inches and the rear 20 inches in size. You won’t mistake the BMW M4 for a run-of-the-mill 4 Series inside. It’s laden with M-coloured stitching, M-badges all over and if that wasn’t enough, it’s like somebody vomited carbon fibre everywhere. A thick model-specific steering wheel is joined by standard electrically-adjustable sports seats that come with illuminated M logos, though you can opt for carbon fibre bucket seats if you want a more race car-akin feel. This version of the BMW M4 is a bit longer than the old car as well, so there’s more room in the back. It’s pretty decent for legroom considering it’s a coupe, but headroom is pretty limited because of the sloping roofline. For no extra cost in the BMW M4 , you get a fantastic infotainment system. It’s intuitive and dead easy to use, plus there’s finally support for Android Auto in addition to Apple CarPlay . Both can be connected wirelessly, as well. In front of you, there’s a 12.3-inch digital drivers display for key driving info, and these have plenty of customisation to them too, including racy-looking M-specific displays. There’s a reasonable amount of boot space in the BMW M4 , with 440 litres. That’s 35 more than the old car and a fair bit more than the Mercedes-AMG C63’s 355 litres, although 40 down on the saloon, and 60 behind the M3 Touring - the king of practical performance. If you’re buying a BMW M4 though, you’re likely after performance — and this latest version has bags of it. Its 3.0-litre twin-turbocharged straight-six engine is good for 510hp and 650Nm of torque in Competition form (which is all you can get in the UK), sent to the rear wheels through an eight-speed automatic gearbox. It fires the M4 from 0-60mph in 3.9 seconds and on to a 155mph limited top speed. You can get that raised to 180mph as part of a package that also includes carbon-ceramic brakes, but it’ll cost you thousands of pounds. When you’re driving it hard, it doesn’t feel quite as spiky and unpredictable as the old car — in part because of amazing levels of grip at the rear. It feels sharper than the likes of the Audi RS5 , yet not as intimidating as the last M4. It’s not just a brutal performance car though and does the normal stuff pretty well. Switch everything into Comfort mode and you can cruise along with lighter steering, though the suspension still has a pretty firm edge to it. Just as you would your firstborn if they rocked back home with a nose piercing though, you can look past the styling and appreciate the BMW M4 for how amazing it is. You might even grow to like the looks, too. If you do, check out the latest BMW M4 deals to see how much you could save.

https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/m135i,BMW M135i Review & Prices,"£18,500",8/10,"Trading in an older performance BMW to buy the M135i is a bit like skipping your favourite pudding to eat a low-fat alternative. You know that it’s better for you, but somehow the healthy option just isn’t as satisfying. A few years back, BMW replaced the full-fat, high-sugar M140i with the low-cal, high-fibre M135i. The old turbocharged six-cylinder petrol, rear-wheel-drive BMW M140i was fantastic at combining decent practicality with sledgehammer performance and a smile-inducing drive. Why then, has its successor, the BMW M135i, been given all-wheel-drive and a less-powerful turbo four-cylinder engine? Well, for better efficiency, mainly, which is a bit boring. That said, its alternatives such as the Mercedes-AMG A35 , Audi S3 and Golf R all offer the same recipe of all-wheel-drive traction and turbocharged four-cylinder power, and have proven themselves thrilling to drive too. The M135i’s new engine means it doesn’t get a long, sweeping bonnet like the car it replaces, but it still packs plenty of angular creases and a prominent grille to make sure it’s one of the sportiest-looking hot hatches around. Things are a little tamer inside, but the M135’s minimalist dashboard and handsome infotainment display look more modern than equivalents in the old car’s cabin. It’s easy to get the hang of and comes with plenty of bang-up-to-date equipment too, including Apple CarPlay, optional gesture controls and BMW’s personal assistant system. The latter is similar to the ‘Hey Mercedes’ feature in the A-Class . Less impressive are BMW’s optional digital dials for the driver which are a gloomy contrast to the crystal-clear display you get in Audis and Mercs. All-told, the Mercedes system has the most impressive tech, but BMW’s iDrive has the edge for usability. In terms of interior quality, the M135i and S3’s plastics, trims and switches are so closely matched it’s impossible to choose a winner. Due to its new engine layout, BMW has been able to redesign the 1-series’ cabin to maximise room for passengers. As a result, there’s more space in all five seats than in the old car so you should be able to carry tall adults in the back in reasonable comfort. The driver benefits from loads of seat and wheel adjustment too. The M135i’s boot is also bigger than in the old M140i, and more spacious than the load bay you’ll find in a Mercedes-AMG A35. Despite being less powerful than its predecessor, the BMW M135i is hardly a soft touch. Its turbocharged engine produces 306hp, which when sent through its standard eight-speed automatic gearbox and all-wheel-drive means 0-62mph in 4.8 seconds. That’s slower than before, yes, but not slow, and although six-cylinders will always sound better, the M135i still has a pleasing rasp when pushed hard. And the new M135i is marginally more comfortable over lumps and bumps in town, even with its stiffer, lower sports suspension. It also has a light, precise steering and decent forward visibility for easy urban manoeuvres. Rearwards it isn’t so good, but then, front and rear parking sensors are standard. Happily, the M135i is also comfortable and quiet on the motorway, but importantly it’s still great fun to thread along a country road, despite its move from rear to four-wheel drive. For some, the 1 Series’ high levels of grip and keen steering will never replace the feel of rear-wheel-drive, but it’s definitely possible to enjoy covering ground quickly. So, the latest M135i is good to drive, powerful and comes with a high-quality interior. If you like its new looks and don’t care that it’s four-wheel drive, then you’ll love it. But if you’re a petrolhead who fell for the old M140i’s creamy-smooth, even-more powerful straight-six engine and playful rear-wheel-drive setup, this new car may leave you feeling short-changed.

https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/6-series-gran-coupe,BMW 6 Series Gran Coupe Review and Prices,"£62,470",8/10,"The BMW 6 Series Gran Coupe is one of the most luxurious cars the company makes. If you can’t quite see how it fits into BMW’s line-up, think of it as a sleeker, more stylish version of the 5 Series saloon. As such, it’s a worthy alternative to the Audi A7 and Mercedes S-Class Coupe. There’s a real elegance to the car’s styling and that kind of understated class and exclusivity is carried over to the cabin. Everything inside is wrapped in soft leather and the asking price guarantees one of the best-built BMW interiors. Essentially, it’s the same as you would get in the regular 6 Series. So, yes, it’s not the most stylish or most technologically advanced out there, but it is very driver-focused and easy to use. The infotainment system is one of the best around, and there’s no shortage of space or comfort in the front seats, either. As you can probably imagine, the shape of the rear doors and the way the roofline drops down at the rear of the car means it’s not easy for everyone to get into the rear seats, particularly if they’re tall. But, there’s actually enough room for a couple of adults in there, if just for a short distance. The only person who’ll really feel shortchanged is anyone sat in the middle seat, as it’s quite narrow and the position of the centre console means they have to sit legs akimbo. It’s a similar story with the boot: the opening is a bit restricted, but the boot itself is a good size. It’ll take 460 litres, which is not far short of what you have in a 7 Series, and you have the added bonus that the rear seats will fold down completely flat, if you want to extend that space. Don’t let all that practicality fool you, though. Under that sleek body beats the heart of the grandest of grand tourers – and that will be obvious after just a few miles behind the wheel. By that stage, you’ll know this car was made to cross continents in the quickest time possible while you remain in a cocoon of luxury and comfort. Buying a Six makes no sense: you can buy something that’s bigger and more practical for less money. But, there’s something wonderfully desirable about the Six that makes you just want it Given how heavy it is, the 6 Series Gran Coupe is remarkably well balanced and very stable at high speeds. The ride comfort is acceptable, even in the firmer ‘Sport’ setting, and the eight-speed gearbox works brilliantly in both manual and automatic modes. Other than a little wind noise, it’s very quiet inside, too, and the only major gripe is that the low-set seat means the view out is a little restricted – not ideal in a car as big as this. As you might only expect, there’s a fairly limited range of engines, but the good news is that they’re all brilliant. You can pick between two petrol engines and one diesel, all of which have two turbochargers, power and performance to spare, and reasonable running costs. The diesel-engined 640d is the pick of the bunch, because it’s just as fast as the similarly priced petrol-engined 640i, but is much cheaper to run, thanks to its impressive fuel economy. On the other hand, if you can afford the extra fuel bills, then there’s always the 650i with its 4.4 V8. And, if that still isn’t enough, there is always the 552bhp M6… Whichever engine you pick, the car will come with a reasonable amount of toys. Even the least expensive SE models have leather upholstery and the best version of BMW’s iDrive infotainment system. On top of that, there are gizmos like the optional head-up display that allows the driver to stay more focused on the road ahead, by projecting information including current speed, sat-nav directions and speed limits onto the windscreen. All in all, the BMW 6 Series Gran Coupe is a very well sorted and desirable executive car. It looks great, has a fabulous range of engines, is surprisingly good to drive and can carry four people in reasonable comfort. It’s well worth considering if you want a ‘four-door coupe’."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/2-series-gran-tourer,BMW 2 Series Gran Tourer Review and Prices,"£25,860",7/10,"The seven-seat BMW 2 Series Gran Tourer represented a step change for the brand when it was launched in 2015, something that’s blatantly obvious when you first clap eyes on its rather van-like form. It was updated in 2018, getting a new front-end design with LED fog lights, new interior design and upholstery options and more exterior colours. It’s what’s underneath the skin that represented the biggest about turn for the company, because the BMW 2 Series Gran Tourer is actually front-wheel drive. BMW’s ‘ultimate driving machine’ tagline? comes, in some part, thanks to its preference for producing rear-wheel-drive models. But, in a car like the Gran Tourer, powering the front wheels allows for a more spacious interior, which will be of greater relevance to most potential buyers. All-wheel drive models are available, too, if you need more grip in tricky conditions. Proof of the packaging advantages come in the form of a spare pair of smaller seats that fold into the boot. They mark the BMW 2 Series Gran Tourer out from the smaller Active Tourer – which is spacious itself, but only has room for five onboard. However, the space around the rearmost seats in the Gran Tourer isn’t what you’d call generous – they’re best off for children on a long journey as both access and knee room is tight. Just like in the smaller Active Tourer, though there’s space for two adults in the outer seats of the rear three-person bench, another in the middle pew and loads of room up front for two tall adults, too. Handily, the middle bench splits 40:20:40 as standard, and will slide back and forth in a 60:40 configuration allowing brilliant flexibility. Unfortunately, though, all-wheel drive models can’t have it. The driver sits quite high even in the seats lowest position, but this at least affords a brilliant view of the road ahead, while visibility in every other direction is good too. As you would expect, the 2 Series Gran Tourer leads the way when it comes to interior quality in a car of this type and size. Everything inside has BMW’s trademark solid build and most of the plastics look and feel expensive. However, remember you’ll pay a premium to drive the Gran Tourer (over rivals such as the Citroen C4 SpaceTourer and the VW Touran) with price starting at around £27,000 and rising beyond £36,000. And, despite a long list of standard equipment, you can expect some expensive options too. Of course, paying extra for the BMW also gets you one of the best infotainment systems on sale today: its iDrive system. OK, so you only get a relatively small 6.5-inch screen on all cars, but it is at least easy to move through its on screen menus via the rotary controller and menu shortcut buttons between the front seats. BMW’s Tech Pack is quite pricey, but brings a bigger screen, as well as a head-up display and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. If space is a priority, there are better MPVs, but nobody can deny that the 2 Series Gran Tourer makes carting a large family about more glamorous Thankfully, BMW hasn’t thrown everything it stands for to the wolves, the Gran Tourer is still good to drive for an MPV, thanks mostly to being based on the playful Mini hatchback. It shares that car’s grippy front end and direct steering, although there’s significantly more body roll to contend with when pushing it hard around tight bends. It rides comfortably, too, as long as you steer clear of the range’s large wheels and stiffer suspension settings. M Sport models, for instance, look great, but with their 18-inch alloy wheels and stiffer suspension set-up they tend to thud into potholes a little firmly for an MPV. You’re better off sticking the smallest wheels and standard more comfortable suspension set-up for the plushest ride quality. As you would expect from any BMW, the 2 Series Gran Tourer gets an excellent range of engines – the majority of which offer spritely performance along with affordable running costs. There are both three and four-cylinder options in both petrol and diesel forms, with power outputs ranging from 140-190hp. The 220d 2.0-litre diesel is bound to be a popular choice thanks to being able to shove itself from 0-62mph in 8.2 seconds and real-world fuel economy of more than 50mpg. Its substantial mid-range performance will also prove useful when the BMW’s packed to the rafters with people and stuff, and it remains quiet and smooth even when rushed. Don’t be put off the smaller 116d diesel or three-cylinder 118i petrol if you spend the majority of time in town, though. They’re cheaper to buy and run and will feel easily up to the job of town work when full to the brim with a family’s gubbins. So, MPV buyers who put quality and technology before outright space should certainly have the BMW 2 Series Gran Tourer on their shortlist. However, we suspect the majority of buyers put space first, and quite simply, there are better alternatives for carrying seven people in comfort, even if that means doing so in slightly less luxurious surroundings."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/m8,BMW M8 Review & Prices,"£145,450",7/10,"If a BMW M4 is a small, nimble Velociraptor, then the BMW M8 is more like a T-Rex. It looks pretty similar from a distance, but up close it’s larger, visibly heftier and much more intimidating. It’s also significantly more powerful and – just like a Mercedes S63 Coupe – has a ravenous appetite. For petrol, that is. The standard BMW 8 Series is already one of the most intimidating cars on the road – short of a monstrous SUV – but the M8 gives it some even more aggressive visual upgrades. At the front, you get an even hungrier-looking mouth with some carbon-fibre fangs below the headlights, a menacing black grille and a speed-bump-scraping splitter. Unique M-alloy wheels stand guard at each corner and at the rear you’ll find a carbon-fibre spoiler, a new rear diffuser and a set of four real exhaust pipes. No horrible plastic fakery going on here. Step inside, and things feel genuinely special, too. There’s a new gear lever – instead of that divisive crystal knob in the standard 8 Series – a red starter button, loads of M-coloured stitching and some uber-supportive sports seats. There’s also plenty of carbon fibre dotted about the place and some special M8-specific dials on the digital driver’s display that gives you all sorts of info about the car’s new driving modes. The rest of the infotainment system doesn’t get any significant upgrades over the standard 8 Series’ unit, but it’s still dead easy to use and comes with a voice-activated personal assistant that’s so helpful Jeeves might want to start updating his CV. It’s a shame you still can’t get Android Auto , though. The back seats are also disappointedly cramped, but that’s no different to the standard 8 Series. If you fancy bringing a few friends along for the ride, there’s always the BMW M8 Gran Coupe with four doors, roomier back seats and a bigger boot to consider. Whichever of these cars you pick, you get the same 4.4-litre twin-turbocharged V8 petrol engine under the bonnet. This unit is related to the one in the M850i, but it’s been comprehensively re-worked by BMW’s nerdiest engineers so it produces a 600hp in standard trim and a whopping 625hp in range-topping M8 Competition guise. As in many new high-performance BMWs, power is sent to all four wheels through an automatic gearbox and a clever four-wheel-drive system that can alter how much power is sent to each wheel. How it does this depends on which of the M8’s many driving modes you choose – a spectrum ranging from tyre-destroying rear-wheel-drive setups to an uber-grippy four-wheel-drive mode that’ll blast you from 0-60mph in less than 3.2 seconds. Even if you ignore the BMW M8’s top-trumps-winning stats, you’ll find it’s a seriously impressive car to drive. The standard adaptive suspension and extra underbody bracing helps make it feel even more agile than an M850i, or even an M5, in tight corners, yet it’ll settle down into an impressively relaxing cruise at motorway speeds. The standard automatic gearbox is one of the best around, too – it’s smooth, responsive and doesn’t lurch at low speeds. One of the few thorns in the BMW M8’s side is that you have to pay extra for plenty of desirable driver-assistance systems – the sort that you get as standard on a Toyota Corolla … Trickier than deciding whether you want to pay for these upgrades, however, is deciding if the M8 is worth the extra cash over the standard 8 Series. Sure, if it’s the ultimate M car you want, it’s the car for you, but for anyone looking for a fast two-seater sports car that’ll lap up long journeys with ease might be better off with an M850i.

https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/i8,BMW i8 Review and Prices,"£106,420",7/10,"The BMW i8 is a futuristic supercar that proves environmentally friendly hybrids needn’t be boring. A powerful turbocharged petrol engine and high-tech electric motor work together to deliver serious performance while some look-at-me styling makes sure you’ll get noticed everywhere from Kensington High Street to a Green Party conference. The i8 first went on sale in 2014, but received a more powerful electric motor and a boosted electric range in 2018. The BMW’s bonkers styling remains unchanged, but it still looks more dramatic than the likes of the Honda NSX and Audi R8 – especially with the upwards-hinging doors spread wide open. Things are a little less theatrical inside, but you still get a smart minimalist interior with loads of plush materials and a digital driver’s display instead of conventional dials as standard. Unlike most supercars, the BMW i8 comes with four seats which help make it surprisingly easy to live with. Sure, there isn’t space in the 154-litre boot for a set of golf clubs, but it’s bigger than the loadbay you get in the Audi and there’s plenty of space in the BMW’s front seats for you to get comfy if you’re more than six-foot tall. The i8 is one of the quietest and most environmentally friendly supercars around, but it’s certainly not a car for shrinking violets – just check out those ludicrous doors! The i8 is more relaxing to drive than most conventional supercars, too – thanks, in part, to its eerily quiet electric motor and fairly comfortable suspension. Visibility is reasonably good, too, so it isn’t particularly difficult to drive around town and you don’t hear much annoying wind or tyre noise at motorway speeds. Stick it in sport mode, however, and things get a little rowdier. The three-cylinder turbocharged petrol engine whirrs into life and the i8’s speakers pipe synthesised engine sounds into the cabin. It’s not quite as exhilarating as hearing a 5.2-litre V10 screaming away behind you like in an R8, but the instant shove from its electric motor means the BMW i8 will sprint from 0-62mph in a still-pretty-blooming-exciting 4.4 seconds. That’s faster than a Porsche 911 Carrera 4. Extensive use of lightweight carbon fibre helps make the i8 as agile as possible on a twisty country road, too, as well as maximising its electric-only range. A three-hour charge from a dedicated wall charger lets you cruise around almost silently for around 30 miles and at up to 75mph. Once you’ve run out of electrical juice, the petrol engine chimes in automatically to push you along and recharge the batteries at the same time. This means that – unlike in many electric cars – you’ll never have to worry about range-anxiety in the BMW i8. Also helping put your mind at rest are the numerous safety features you get as standard, including automatic emergency braking that’ll hit the brakes if the car senses an obstacle in the road ahead. It’s not the most exciting supercar to drive, but the i8 is an extremely accomplished sports hybrid and a worthy alternative to the likes of the more conventional Porsche 911 and the more expensive Honda NSX."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/ix1,BMW iX1 Review & Prices,"£43,215",8/10,"The BMW iX1 is the German brand’s all-electric version of the ever-popular X1 SUV. The iX1 takes inspiration from the bulkier BMW iX flagship, while being the most compact family option of BMW's electric SUVs . It’s like getting the latest phone that’s one step down from the most advanced version but still on trend. Coming with the same exterior design as the latest X1, there are some blue tweaks alongside the kidney grille and angular headlights to mark out the electric version, but it's all very subtle. Sportier models also come with a more aggressive design. You get angular rear lights too with a 3D effect, plus a large rear window and sporty elements, such as the roof spoiler and low-end diffuser. Inside, there are few buttons cluttering the cabin – although that does mean you get fiddly infotainment and climate controls thanks to too many switches being removed. There’s also no iDrive control dial, which means you have to do all major functions through the touchscreen . The design is pleasing on the whole though, with soft materials used up high and on all the main touch points. In the back there’s a decent amount of space, with good head and knee room. Although quality on the whole is fine, it takes a step down from the front part of the cabin. That being said, it still feels like a top product. Range: 267-322 miles Efficiency: 3.5-4.0 miles per kWh Battery size: 67kWh Max charge speed: 130kW Charge time AC: 10hrs, 0-100% at 7kW Charge time DC: 29 mins, 10-80% at 130kW Charge port location: Right rear Power outputs: 201hp / 308hp Practicality-wise, the iX1 also holds its own, with an impressive 490-litre boot – only 10 litres less than the flagship iX. That being said, the boot is marginally smaller than that of the Audi Q4 e-tron , though larger than that of the Volvo XC40 Recharge . The iX1 comes with a pair of model options, both powered by the same 65kWh motor. The more powerful is the 313hp all-wheel drive xDrive30 complete with two electric motors, with one mounted on each axle for all-wheel drive. You get an official range of up to 270 miles, with the top M Sport having a slightly reduced max range of 267 miles. Then there's the front-wheel drive 204hp eDrive20 with a range of up to 294 miles. When you’re driving, it’s odd how much the iX1 feels like driving the much larger iX. The overall experience is refined and quiet, with little disruption from the outside world in terms of noise. It’s comfortable while cruising, but weighing over two tonnes contributes to the fact that you will feel some bumps through the cabin. Around town is where the iX1 impresses most, as it is super quiet and with great visibility all round, you shouldn’t get caught out. The steering is light for easy manoeuvring, while it also doesn’t feel too big. The 'B' drive mode increases brake regen but doesn’t provide full one-pedal drive. Twistier roads do show up the weight again, as there's some lean through the bends if you’re going at higher speeds. But the steering, although lacking feel, is direct and you have plenty of grip. The iX1 feels remarkably composed and capable, and should be the benchmark if you’re in the market for an electric family SUV. It’s a shame that it’s rather expensive though. You'll want to check out the latest BMW iX1 deals on Carwow, then, to see how much you could save. There are also great deals on used iX1s , as well as other used BMWs .

As such, the Gran Coupe’s front end is practically identical to its smaller sibling’s, sporting the same lean headlights and wide ‘kidney’ grille: the classic BMW trademark. Things change as you travel further backwards: the Gran Coupe has a more upright windscreen and rear window, intended to increase front headroom and boot space respectively. Oh yes, and then there’s the minor detail of the Gran Coupe having double the number of doors than the standard 8 Series coupe. The BMW 8 Series Gran Coupe’s wheelbase (the distance between the front and rear wheels) is 3,023mm – 201mm over the standard BMW 8 Series’. This means that the car will have more generous legroom for its rear passengers. Meanwhile, the steeper angle of the windscreen and rear windows will make for more headroom wherever you’re sat. BMW calls the Gran Coupe a “4+1-seater”, citing – alongside the two proper front and rear seats – the space for a fifth passenger in the middle of the rear bench, which, it claims, “is suitable for use on short journeys”. So, ideally, the Gran Coupe is best for accommodating anywhere up to four adults. The BMW 8 Series Gran Coupe has three engines for you to choose from: two petrols and one diesel. The entry-level version of the car – the 840i – is rear-wheel drive and has a six-cylinder petrol engine capable of putting out 340hp. This can take the Gran Coupe from 0-62mph in 5.2 seconds while returning a claimed fuel economy of up to 38.2mpg. From initial appearances, it seems that the mid-range 840d is going to be the pick of the 8 Series Gran Coupe range. It’s four-wheel-drive, meaning that – while its maximum power output is just 320hp – it can reach 62mph from a standstill in 5.1 seconds, with an impressive fuel economy of up to 45.6mpg. The range-topping, four-wheel-drive M850i trades economy for pure power. It goes from 0-62mph in only 3.9 seconds and has 530hp to play with. Sadly, BMW claims that it returns just 28.5mpg.

It’s the electric alternative to the 7 Series and features the latest battery technology from the German firm. It’s a lot like buying a nice faux leather jacket instead of one made from a cow. Looks-wise, the i7 will definitely split opinions. But once you’re used to it, the large kidney grilles and split headlights look pretty smart, while the long bonnet exudes class. The limousine styling continues down the side, so it can look a bit slab-sided, but the optional two-tone paint option could be a master stroke if you like that sort of thing. From the rear, it’s pretty square, and you don’t get a full width light bar that is all the rage these days. You also get a lot of blue ‘electricity’ accents around the car to make it visually different from the 7 Series. You get one of the nicest-feeling interiors around in the i7, with lots of leather – or vegan leather if you prefer – alongside crystally controls  for the seat adjustment and gear lever. There’s also a lovely crystal strip that lights up depending on the climate control or interior ambience. But the highlight of the i7 is the optional cinema widescreen in the back. Folding down from the roof, it can stream your favourite shows or films on-demand, and it’s all controlled via voice commands or a door-mounted touchscreen. You can also get business class-style rear seats that recline to make you feel even more at home and comfortable on long drives. The main point of the i7 isn’t the boot space, but you still get 500 litres to work with. You can’t fold the seats down to increase load capacity, which is a shame, and the i7 loses 25 litres compared to the plug-in hybrid 7 Series models. It’s also considerably down on the Mercedes EQS , which offers 610 litres. The compact battery pack has a 102kWh capacity, and with that you can go up to 388 miles on a single charge. That is quite a way off the best for the Mercedes EQS, which can do up to 441 miles. Out on the road, the i7 starts to surpass the Mercedes EQS, as well as some other big high-end EVs like the Tesla Model S . With the adaptive air suspension setup, bumps are barely noticeable and you’ll have next to no trouble on a long journey, where you can use the adaptive cruise control to make for a serene drive. There’s no hiding that in town it feels all of its 5.4m, but with the help of all around cameras, you’ll be able to make smooth progress. The instant electric power also makes getting in and out of junctions easy. The i7 can also park itself while you keep an eye on your surroundings. On the whole, the i7 is a comfortable and an accomplished limo that the Mercedes EQS and Tesla Model S will struggle to match. Although the Mercedes will go further on a charge, the i7 manages to be more fun to drive and packed with even more kit. While it may divide opinions with its looks, it's definitely the leader in the premium electric market. If you like what you see, check out the latest BMW i7 deals available through Carwow.

https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/m240i-convertible,BMW M240i Convertible Review and Prices,"£40,525",7/10,"The BMW M240i Convertible is a drop-top version of the sporty M240i Coupe which is worth considering if you’re looking for something small, fast and fun but don’t like the sound of an Audi TT Roadster or a Porsche 718 Cayman. Sure, the fairly unassuming BMW M240i Convertible doesn’t look quite as dramatic as these long-slung sports cars, but it comes with plenty of sporty features to help you tell it apart from the standard 2 Series Convertible. The front and rear bumpers are lower and more aggressive, you get some bigger alloy wheels and at the back, you’ll find a pair of larger exhaust pipes. Step inside, and the BMW M240i Convertible doesn’t feel quite so special. Sure, everything feels just as well put together as in the super solid 2 Series, but it doesn’t look as sporty as the cabins in either the Audi TT Roadster or Porsche 718 Cayman and the higher seating position means you don’t feel quite so cocooned inside. You do get plenty of equipment as standard though – including BMW’s excellent iDrive infotainment system with built-in satellite navigation – but you can’t get a digital driver’s display like in the TT Roadster which is a shame. You do get a decent amount of seat adjustment as standard, though, and the BMW M240i Convertible comes with more supportive leather-trimmed sports seats than the standard 2 Series. Predictably, space in the back seats is no better than the standard car – two kids will have just enough space to get comfy but adults will feel pretty claustrophobic, especially with the roof up. The BMW M240i Convertible is a more usable alternative to the likes of the two-seat Porsche 718 Cayman with a superb six-cylinder engine and a plush interior. Having said that, the TT Roadster is even tighter in the back and the 718 Cayman doesn’t have any back seats at all. All three cars have similar-sized boots, though, so you can carry a few suitcases whether the roof is up or down. Speaking of putting the roof down, the BMW M240i Convertible makes a great countryside cruiser. Its 340hp six-cylinder engine is smooth, sounds lovely and has enough poke to blast you from 0-62mph in five seconds flat. The standard manual gearbox is lovely and precise, but if you spend a lot of time in town you’ll want to get the optional automatic instead. It doesn’t just make the BMW M240i Convertible easier to drive, it also makes it slightly more economical. The standard suspension does a good job ironing out bumps around town and stopping the BMW M240i Convertible’s body leaning in tight corners, but the optional Adaptive M Sport Dampers make it better still. This system lets you choose between softer settings for long motorway journeys and firmer setups to make the car feel more agile on twisty roads – effectively letting you have your cake and eat it. Even with its upgraded suspension turned up to 11 though, the BMW M240i Convertible doesn’t feel quite as sharp as the Porsche 718 Cayman. But, it’s still huge fun to drive and will be easier to live with every day."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/m5,BMW M5 Review & Prices,"£111,515",7/10,"Few car nameplates are as illustrious as ‘M5’ - not just a cracking bit of motorway, but BMW’s flagship 5 Series model since 1984. The latest BMW M5 (known as the ‘G90’ generation) marks a big step forwards as it’s the first time the M5 has used a plug-in hybrid powertrain. It’s like putting solar panels on your eight-bedroomed mansion - you’re not actually making that much difference to the planet, but you are unlocking numerous benefits for yourself and showing off how eco you are to the rest of the world. At the same time, you may well upset the purists who think a heat pump and underfloor heating is sacrilegious compared to a good old oil-fired Aga and some cast-iron radiators. There’s nothing backward-thinking about the new M5, though it does still have a distinctly old-school heart - underneath the batteries and motors of the plug-in hybrid system sits a 4.4-litre V8 petrol engine. This produces a beefy 585hp on its own, but combined with the whole system it produces an official 727hp (more on this later) and 1,000Nm of torque. That’s enough to give the M5 tremendous performance, despite its vast weight - at over 2,400kg, it’s heavier than a Range Rover Sport . A totally reworked suspension system with a hugely configurable set of adaptive dampers, four-wheel drive and rear-wheel steering all help to manage this weight, though. If you’re considering a BMW M5, you’ve probably got your eyes on quite a few - all hugely powerful - alternatives. For the first time in a while, you can choose from a BMW M5 as either a saloon or a Touring (estate) model - widening its appeal, and giving it even more natural alternatives. The most obvious is the Audi RS6 , though Mercedes hasn’t yet launched its halo E-Class model yet, so only the less powerful E 53 is available. It too is a plug-in hybrid, though. Other alternatives are numerous. There are luxury limos like the Porsche Panamera , but fans of practical performance are more than ever opting for fast SUVs these days - like BMW’s own X5 M Competition or the Range Rover Sport SV. There are even credible fully electric alternatives worth considering now, too, such as the Porsche Taycan , Audi RS e-tron GT , Mercedes EQE 53 or even the Tesla Model S Plaid . Outside of the engine and performance upgrades, the new M5 is very similar to the regular 5 Series - it’s even available as a Touring model for those who want a bit of extra boot space. You can tell it apart thanks to its chunky makeover, though, with wide wheel arches, new air intakes and quad exhausts at the rear. Inside, you get M-specific seats and upholstery, plus some bespoke touches to the infotainment and driver screen, but the 5 Series’ practical interior remains largely unchanged. Like the regular 5 Series plug-in hybrid, too, the M5 can be run on purely electric power, giving you the potential of some seriously low running costs - provided you can keep your foot off the loud pedal. It’s even quite a cost-effective company car, too. In the meantime, you can check out the best BMW M5 deals on Carwow, or look for other great BMW deals here.

https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/5-series-touring,BMW 5 Series Touring Review & Prices,"£54,445",Not found,"The BMW 5 Series Touring is a posh estate car with a plug-in hybrid engine that makes it ideal as a practical family car , or for company car drivers looking for something comfortable to rack up miles in. It’s a bit like a Burberry backpack, because it’s posh and practical in equal measure. SUVs might be the on-trend choice, but there are plenty of estate alternatives to consider if you prefer to sit lower in the car. Other posh estates include the Audi A6 Avant and Mercedes E-Class Estate , or you could opt for a well-specced Volkswagen Passat . The 5 Series Touring isn’t the best-looking car, with odd angular lines in the bodywork that never feel quite as cohesive as more elegantly styled generations of old. Things get better inside, though, with a clean design for the most part. You get a smart piece of trim splitting the dashboard widthways and a pair of screens above this. BMW’s infotainment tech is some of the best in the business, with crisp displays and intuitive menu navigation. Boot space is up on the BMW 5 Series Saloon , increasing from that car’s 520 litres to 570 litres. Not a huge leap, but the more boxy shape should make it easier to load large items. It’s worth noting the Mercedes E-Class Estate has a roomier boot than this and the Audi A6 Avant, with the BMW’s boot the smallest of the trio. At launch, there’s just the one plug-in hybrid engine option. Called 530e, it combines a 2.0-litre petrol engine with an electric motor to make 184hp, while the battery provides a range of nearly 60 miles. This will be particularly appealing to company car drivers because of the favourable Benefit-in-Kind rate, though for the same reason the all-electric i5 Touring is also worth a look. Another plug-in hybrid, as well as a regular petrol engine, will join the line-up later. Although we’ve not been behind the wheel of this new model just yet, it’s likely to drive very much like the 5 Series Saloon. As such, you can expect a refined and comfortable car that’s at its best at motorway speeds, though perhaps not as much fun on a twisty road as its predecessors. If you’re interested in this car, find out how much you could save with Carwow’s BMW 5 Series Touring deals. You can also get a great price on a used 5 Series Touring, as well as other used BMW models. If you want to sell your car online , Carwow can help with that, too."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/3-series,BMW 3 Series Review & Prices,"£41,220",9/10,"The BMW 3 Series is like Alan Shearer. No, it’s not from Newcastle, but like Shearer it has for generations been a reliable and impressive performer, able to out-shine European and world opposition at the highest level, and is still going strong even in its advancing years. While Audi might be re-inventing the A4 as the new A5 (rather confusingly) and Mercedes has brought out a new C-Class while BMW was just updating the 3 Series, this is still a car that looks and feels totally cutting edge, especially in how it drives. Though if you would also consider an electric car , the Tesla Model 3 feels more futuristic still. In terms of styling, the most recent round of updates for the 3 Series haven’t changed that much. There’s been some small nipping and tucking around the lights and grille, some new wheels and paint options, but the overall shape and style remains the same. That’s both good and bad — good in that, overall, the 3 Series is still a handsome thing. Bad in that it hasn’t addressed some design mis-steps, such as the way the 3 looks overly bulky around the rear wheelarches. Basic Sport models get chrome trim around the radiator grille, while M-Sport models look a little more glowering with blacked-out trim. It’s in the cabin that you’ll find the bigger changes. BMW has binned the (rather attractive) separate digital instruments and infotainment screen in favour of the big, curved, combined screen setup taken from other models such as the 4 Series and 5 Series . This means that the 3 Series now has the latest and most up to date infotainment software — which can update itself via over-the-air links — but even though the old iDrive click-wheel has been retained, there are some fiddly bits to find your way around on the screens, and the graphics don’t look quite as nice as they used to. Space in the cabin remains unchanged, which means you get just enough for four adults to sit in reasonable comfort, but there’s not the stretch-out space you’d find elsewhere. The boot is practical, especially in the Touring estate, but remember that the plug-in hybrid 330e — a hugely popular model with business user-choosers — loses quite a lot of that space to the battery, to the point where a basic VW Golf hatchback has a bigger boot. Not that you’ll care about boot space much when you’re sitting up in the driver’s seat. The BMW 3 Series has long been considered the best of its breed to drive, and that hasn’t changed, despite the fact it’s bigger and heavier now than it has ever been. While we have to wait to see what Audi has cooked up with the new A5 saloon, the 3 Series most definitely has the beating of the otherwise-impressive Mercedes C-Class when it comes to the driving experience. The engine range has shrunk somewhat in the past few years — your choice at the base of the BMW 3 Series lineup is now restricted to the petrol 320i or the plug-in hybrid 330e. Bye-bye diesel 320d — we shall miss your combo of easy-going performance and exceptional economy, though there are plenty of excellent used examples to be found. In fact, there are now no diesel 3 Series models at all, something of a shock when you remember how wildly successful they have been over the years. Mind you, the 330e looks like it might be settling into the 320d’s economy shoes, not least because a big battery upgrade now means that it can do as much as 62 miles on electric power alone, if you remember to charge up the battery (which can’t, alas, be fast-charged from public DC chargers). Of course, if it’s serious performance you want — but you don’t fancy the expense and insurance cost of stepping up to a full-on M3 — there’s the brilliant M340i with its 374hp, straight-six, 3.0-litre turbo engine. Whisper it, but that’s actually a more enjoyable car to drive even than the mighty M3 itself. If you want to bag yourself a great deal, check out Carwow’s BMW 3 Series deals . You can also get a great price on a used 3 Series as well as other used BMWs from our network of trusted dealers. Carwow’s Sell My Car service takes the pain out of moving your old motor on, too."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/3-series-gran-turismo,BMW 3 Series Gran Turismo Review and Prices,"£30,385",7/10,"The BMW 3 Series Gran Turismo is a larger, more practical version of the 3 Series saloon that comes with more passenger space in the back and a bigger boot. It’s an alternative to the likes of the Audi A5 Sportback and the smaller Mercedes CLA Shooting Brake. Step inside, and you’ll find the BMW 3 Series Gran Turismo’s interior looks pretty much identical to what you get in the standard 3 Series. There’s a similar broad dashboard with intuitive heating and ventilation controls and a free-standing infotainment display. Everything feels just as well built and plush, but it still trails the bulletproof Audi A5 Sportback for outright fit and finish. In terms of practicality, the BMW 3 Series Gran Turismo edges ahead, however. There’s just as much head and legroom in the front seats as you get in the standard 3 Series saloon but the 3 Series Gran Turismo’s longer body means your passengers get to enjoy slightly more legroom in the back. Unfortunately, try to carry three adults side-by-side, and you’ll hear nothing but complaints from your passenger in the middle seat – a large lump in the floor leaves them nowhere to put their feet. That said, they’ll still have more space to stretch out than in the Audi A5 Sportback and the BMW 3 Series Gran Turismo comes with a bigger boot, too. There’s space for a few large suitcases or a set of golf clubs with the back seats up and – with them folded down – a bike will fit with both wheels attached. The BMW 3 Series Gran Turismo’s back end looks a little like a 3 Series Touring that’s been sat on by an elephant. Despite this, it’s still impressively practical Don’t think all this luggage space means the BMW 3 Series Gran Turismo drives like a boxy SUV – it’s noticeably more nimble than the Audi A5 Sportback on a twisty country road. It doesn’t feel quite as agile as the lighter, shorter 3 Series saloon, but with the optional adaptive suspension fitted it does a fine job for such a roomy car. Driving the BMW 3 Series Gran Turismo is fairly relaxing, too. It’s quiet and comfortable at motorway speeds, and the light steering means it isn’t at all strenuous to drive around town. It’s not all good news, however – it’s not quite as easy to manoeuvre as the smaller 3 Series saloon and you’ll have to pay extra for parking sensors and a reversing camera. There are plenty of engines to choose from – including frugal diesels best suited to long motorway journeys and a range of petrols, including a seriously rapid 340i model. Sadly, you’ll have to pay extra for plenty of driver assistance systems – even automatic emergency braking costs extra across the range. If you’re happy to pay extra for a few desirable options, then the BMW 3 Series Gran Turismo makes a very comfortable, very upmarket five-seater. You’ll just have to decide whether the extra space is worth the premium over the standard 3 Series saloon and estate…"
https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/m4-convertible,BMW M4 Convertible Review & Prices,"£95,330",8/10,"The BMW M4 Competition Convertible is kind of a car without many alternative options at the moment. With Mercedes still to produce a proper AMG version of the new CLE convertible , and Audi just taking the RS5 out of production, the M4 is the only way you can take four people and luggage out for a high-speed run, and not have to buy a Porsche or Ferrari . It’s kind of like a four-wheeled Barry Manilow — big nose, big talent, and designed for the California lifestyle. Yes, that nose is still there, although we’re kind of starting to warm to it after a few years of familiarity. The huge ‘kidney’ grilles (if those are the kidneys, what must the pancreas look like?) aren’t what you’d call elegant, but in the right colour (please, not Sao Paulo yellow…) they don’t seem to look quite so bad these days. Aside from the nose, you can tell the M4 Competition apart from a regular BMW 4 Series Convertible thanks to the extra little vents on the front wheel arches, and the big diffuser poking out from beneath the boot, with four massive exhaust pipes (which, thankfully, are real pipes and not stuck-on fakes). As standard, the alloy wheels are ‘staggered’ meaning that they’re 19-inch rims up front, and 20-inch wheels down the back. You can choose from six different wheel designs, two of which are no-cost options. If you’re going to buy a BMW M4 Competition Convertible, you’d better like carbon-fibre as it’s pretty much everywhere on the inside. There’s acres of the stuff on the dashboard, the centre console and the doors. Other M-specific touches are a thicker three-spoke steering wheel with a butter-soft leather rim, a bright-red starter button, and the handy little M1 and M2 driving mode memory buttons on the steering wheel. The standard sports front seats are great, and while you can spec carbon-fibre backed racing-style bucket seats, you probably shouldn’t — they’re rock hard, and come with a hard slab of carbon fibre right at the edge of the seat base which is in a very, er, delicate position. The back seats are pretty small, and while the M4 Coupe actually has reasonably practical space in the back, the room turned over to the convertible top means that here in the Convertible, the back seats are more upright and more cramped. That roof is a proper fabric one — much nicer than the heavy folding-metal roof on the previous M4 model — and it retracts in just 18 seconds, which you can do at speeds of up to 31mph. The dashboard of the M4 Competition Convertible is dominated by the big, sweeping digital screen — actually two screens in one mounting, a 12.3-inch instrument panel for the driver, and a 14.9-inch touchscreen infotainment system. That bigger screen comes with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto , but while the on-screen menus look good and are reasonably easy to find your way around, we’d love a few more physical buttons. Boot space is only OK. Compared to the useful 440 litres offered by the M4 Coupe, the Convertible has only 300 litres when the roof is folded away, although you do get a little more when the roof is up. It’s still not what you’d call massively spacious, though. The M4 Convertible is massively fast, though. The twin-turbo 3.0-litre straight-six petrol engine develops a whopping 530hp, which is enough to fling it to 62mph in just 3.7 seconds. The top speed is, in theory, limited to 155mph, but if you tick the options box for the M-Driver pack (which includes a complimentary training session with BMW M-Sport) then that can be raised to 173mph. Handy if you’re popping to Germany for a holiday… Standard four-wheel drive means that the M4 Convertible is a true all-weather device, and feels secure and planted even in the most treacherous conditions. It does mean that it feels a fraction less lively than the old rear-wheel drive model, but there is a two-wheel drive mode deep in the on-screen settings menu. BMW has stiffened up the structure a bit to cope with the loss of the steel roof, but it’s definitely not quite as sharp as the Coupe. That said, the M4 Competition Convertible is still a smooth enough car to be able to use as a daily driver, and if you switch it all into Comfort mode, then it’s actually quite refined. In fact, it’s so talented a car — with all that summer-time headroom and fresh air — that you might even grow to like the looks, too.

https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/x7,BMW X7 Review & Prices,"£92,160",9/10,"Let’s address the elephant in the room – oh, and this elephant also has a set of comedy gnashers on. Yes, the way the BMW X7 looks will not be to everybody’s taste, but if you like your large luxurious SUVs to be imposing, it doesn’t get much more so than the X7’s whopping great grille filling somebody’s rearview mirror. In fact, the BMW X7 is arguably more imposing than the upmarket SUVs it competes with, the Land Rover Discovery , Audi Q7 and Mercedes GLS . Even a full-fat Range Rover. Think of it as American sports announcer Michael Buffer at a headteacher’s conference.  Inside, things are more restrained, but suitably high quality. You’ll find plenty of piano black, leather and metal surfaces, while adding a (pricey) full merino leather option brings leather lower down and a two-tone shade. Ultimately, you’ll struggle to find any scratchy plastics here and the X7 gives all its alternatives a run for their money inside. The dash is dominated by the curved twin-screen display that incorporates BMW’s latest iDrive infotainment system. It’s stunning to look at, but not quite as easy to use as the previous generation. There are a few functions that are now buried in menus rather than easily accessible with a single button press. It still has a rotary controller with menu shortcut buttons between the front seats, and you can choose to use that, the touchscreen or use voice commands. The second screen behind the steering wheel takes the place of conventional instruments. It’s clear, crisp and configurable, so you can have the information displayed that you want, including things like speed, fuel consumption, navigation info and your radio or media selection. Bluetooth, DAB radio and Apple CarPlay smartphone mirroring is all included, although not Android Auto . All-in-all, it’s better than anything from Audi or Land Rover , although the digital dash and infotainment in the Mercedes GLS is even better. The BMW X7 is a proper seven-seater as standard, which is to say, two adults will be able to sit in comfort in its rearmost seats on a long journey. A BMW X5 ’s optional third row is much tighter, for example. The X7’s front two rows are even more spacious and the driver is treated to a wide range of electric seat and wheel adjustment. In fact, the middle row can be adjusted and folded electrically, while the third row folds into the boot floor electrically too. Handy buttons in the boot allow you to fold the rear two rows all at the same time for ease. Even with all seven seats up, the X7 still offers 320 litres of boot space, which is about the same as a VW Polo. Fold the rearmost seats down and that grows to a huge 750 litres – that’ll handle pretty much anything a family can throw at it. And you get a fancy split tailgate. You have a choice between one diesel and two petrol engines when buying a BMW X7. The pick of the bunch is the X7 xDrive40d diesel because, with 352hp and an official fuel economy of 32.8-36.2mpg, it has all the power you’ll need, but will keep the bills sensible. The 530hp M60i petrol is much quicker, but also much more expensive in every way, while the 381hp 40i petrol is strong and smooth, but thirstier than the diesel. The BMW X7 is vast, so driving and parking it in town can be a little daunting. Still, it comes with front and rear sensors, multiple cameras for a 3D view of the car and a system that’ll park and even reverse for you. So, no excuses then. Out of town and on meandering country roads the X7 is one of the tidiest SUVs of its type to drive despite its size, but you’ll probably be more interested in just how comfortable its air suspension is over bumps and how quiet it is at a cruise on the motorway. There’s very little wind and road noise at all, and adding BMW’s Driving Assistant Professional optional package brings a system that will accelerate, brake and keep you in your lane for an even more relaxing drive. So, make peace with its looks, don’t get carried away with BMW’s options list and the X7 is a fine luxury seven-seat SUV. Remember, though, that it’s more expensive to buy than a Discovery or Q7, and that if you don’t need seven roomy seats, BMW’s cheaper X5 makes much more sense.

https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/m3,BMW M3 Review & Prices,"£89,545",9/10,"The BMW M3 is a high-performance saloon alternative to the Audi RS4 , Mercedes-AMG C 63 and Alfa Romeo Giulia Quadrifoglio . It’s the original and still considered the best by many, loved for packing so much pace and excitement into a sensible, family friendly body. The latest generation has more power and luxury than ever, but that might not matter to you one jot if you take one look at it and don’t like what you see... There’s more to the outlandish styling of the BMW M3 than just the ‘kidney’ (maybe lungs would be more appropriate) grille. Huge intakes sit either side of the bottom of the front bumper, while down the side swollen wheel arches make it stand out from a regular 3 Series . In fact, the only bit of bodywork shared with the standard car is the boot lid — though here it has a spoiler tacked on top. You’ll see a quad-exit exhaust sat below a chunky diffuser, and happily, those huge tailpipes are real. You have the option between two alloy wheel designs as well, with the front pair 19 inches and the rear 20 inches in size. You can also choose to have lots of the exterior details clad in carbon fibre, although this is a pricey option. You’re not going to mistake the BMW M3 for a run-of-the-mill 3 Series inside, either. It’s covered with M-coloured stitching, M-badges everywhere and if that wasn’t enough, it’s like somebody spilt a large mug of carbon fibre all over the place. A thick model-specific steering wheel features, as well as standard electrically-adjustable sports seats that come with illuminated M logos, though you can opt for figure-hugging carbon fibre bucket seats if you want a feel more akin to a racing car. This version of the BMW M3 is a bit longer than the old car as well, so there’s more room in the back. Legroom back there is pretty good, and there’s more headroom here than the equivalent M4 as a result of the saloon body style. You could easily use this as a family car. You get a fantastic new infotainment system on a 14.9-inch screen, it’s intuitive and dead easy to use, plus there’s support for Android Auto in addition to Apple CarPlay . Both can be connected wirelessly, as well. In front of you, there’s a 12.3-inch digital drivers display for key driving info, and this has some customisation to it too, including racy-looking M-specific displays. It’s not the most configurable or exciting-looking instrument display in the business, however. There’s a reasonable amount of boot space in the BMW M3, with 480 litres. That’s identical to the outgoing car, though those after a bit more room will be happy to know there's also an M3 Touring available in an estate body style. If you’re buying a BMW M3 though, you’re likely most interested in its performance — and this latest version has bags of it. Its 3.0-litre twin-turbocharged straight-six engine is good for 510bhp and 650Nm of torque in Competition form (which is all you can get in the UK), sent to the rear wheels through an eight-speed automatic gearbox. It fires the M3 from 0-60mph in 3.9 seconds and on to a 155mph limited top speed. You can get that raised to 180mph either as a standalone option or as part of a package that also includes carbon-ceramic brakes, but it’ll cost you £8,000. Gulp. Another option you can get on the M3 for the first time ever in the UK is an xDrive version. This brings in the same switchable four-wheel drive system as you’ll find on the M5, allowing you to have the security of all-weather traction mixed with the ability to switch back into rear-wheel drive for some hooliganism. When you’re driving it hard, the M3 doesn’t feel quite as spiky and unpredictable as the old car — largely in part because of impressive levels of grip all-round. It feels sharper than the likes of the Audi RS4, yet not as intimidating as the outgoing version. It’s even less spiky in the four-wheel drive version, which rivals the Audi for storming all weather, all season pace. This is more than just a brutal performance car though and does the normal stuff pretty well. Switch everything into Comfort mode and you can cruise along pretty pleasantly enjoying lighter steering, though the suspension still has a pretty firm edge to it at low speed. As you probably would with your other half’s surprise tattoo, you can probably look past the looks and appreciate the BMW M3 for the impressive performance car it is.

https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/i3,BMW i3 Review and Prices,"£30,990",8/10,"The BMW i3 is well worth considering if you’re looking for an electric car that’s easy to drive around town and has a stylish, upmarket interior. But like an iPad next to a white-label Android tablet, you’ll pay more for the i3’s sharp looks and quality than you will for its more ordinary alternatives. Inside the i3 you get BMW’s brilliant iDrive with high-resolution 10-inch infotainment screen and sat nav as standard, but unfortunately, BMW’s wooden dashboard trims and partial leather seats aren’t – they’re only available as part of BMW’s optional Loft, Lodge and Suite interior trim packages. But even without one of these upgraded packs, the i3’s cabin still looks plush and there’s plenty of space for you to get comfortable – even if you’re more than six-foot tall. Sadly, space in the back isn’t quite as generous but there’s still enough space for kids to stretch out. The i3’s special rear-hinged back doors mean it’s easy to lift in a bulky child seat too, and its oddly shaped rear windows mean the back seats do at least feel impressively airy. Sadly, it’s a strict four-seater and its boot isn’t particularly spacious. As a result, both the Renault Zoe and Nissan Leaf are more practical electric cars. The BMW i3 comes as standard with a compact battery pack and a small electric motor driving the rear wheels. BMW claims this combination gives you a range of 188 miles between charges, but in real-world conditions, you can expect it to manage closer to 160 miles. The upmarket BMW i3 is a left-field choice in an already niche market, but look past its sci-fi styling and you’ll find it’s pretty easy to live with. There’s also an ‘s’ model which has more power but also a slightly reduced range – it’ll officially to go 175 miles between charges. However, BMW thinks that in the real world the i3s will also cover around 160 miles, matching the standard model. Don’t go thinking the i3’s a sluggish eco car only suited to plodding to the shops – the standard car’s 170hp electric motor delivers almost instant bursts of acceleration helping it sprint from 0-62mph in a thoroughly respectable 7.3 seconds. The i3s is even quicker, with its 184hp electric motor cutting that sprint time to 6.9 seconds. Whichever model you pick, you’ll find the BMW very easy to drive. It’s turning circle is very tight and its large windows make it easy to see out of and a breeze to park. Unfortunately, it isn’t quite as comfortable as the Zoe and Leaf. Its stiff suspension and large alloy wheels highlight bumps in the road and you’ll hear quite a lot of wind and tyre noise at motorway speeds. It can’t quite match the Zoe in terms of safety, either. It earned a four-star score from Euro NCAP in 2013 compared with the Renault’s five-star rating in the same year, and automatic emergency city braking is optional too. But if you can live with this compromise, the BMW’s a stylish small family car that’s worth considering if you mainly drive in town and have somewhere to charge it.

https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/6-series-gt,BMW 6 Series Gran Turismo Review and Prices,"£45,890",6/10,"The BMW 6 Series is a five-door coupe with a boot opening that’s larger than you get in the 5 Series saloon, so it’s ideal if you have a dog but don’t want a dreary estate car. From the driver’s seat, the 6 Series feels like any other BMW – it’s very nice. Plastic quality is excellent – even the bottoms of the doors have quality plastics – and you also get expensive looking trims and mood lighting in the front and back. Naturally, you get a soft leather interior as standard and sat behind the steering wheel the BMW cocoons you as if you were in a sports car. That said, the 6 Series GT’s extra height over the 5 Series saloon means you get a good view over the road ahead, and there’s plenty of space even for exceptionally tall adults. Your back-seat passengers also get plenty of room, and you’ll love the 6 Series GT for its extra rear space compared to the 5 Series saloon. You can fit three adults in the back quite comfortably too. That said, the reason you choose a GT over a BMW 5 Series saloon is because of its larger boot, which is 610 litres in size next to the 530-litre capacity you get in the saloon. The GT’s glassy boot means it can carry dogs and its hatchback-style opening means it also easier to pack full of luggage for big family holidays. Interior storage is also decent thanks to the large pockets on the four passenger doors and the car’s four cupholders. The only slight disappointment is the small size of the glovebox that also houses the ventilation system’s fragrance dispenser. The BMW 6 Series Gran Turismo is comfortable, quick and spacious but it's expensive and not exactly a looker There’s not much to disappoint you about the way the 6 Series drives though. In town, the optional four-wheel steering gives it an extremely tight turning circle, the optional air suspension is very comfortable over bumpy roads and you can set the steering to be light for effortless low-speed manoeuvring. Swap town for country and you can add weight to the steering in Sport mode, to make the car feel more stable going into fast bends, and there’s loads of grip if you need to get a move on. It barely leans in fast bends and on the motorway the cabin is reasonably quiet save for a little bit of tyre roar at the legal limit. Engine noise is well suppressed even if you choose the 3.0-litre diesel. It’s the pick of the range – you can also have 2.0 and 3.0-litre petrols – because it’s smooth, refined and quick, but also capable of returning fuel economy of up to 55.3mpg. With the diesel fitted, the 6 Series GT has a jack-of-all-trades character. It’s posh but also a practical family car and, with the diesel engine fitted, it’s quick and comfortable too."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/m8-gran-coupe,BMW M8 Gran Coupe Review & Prices,"£142,950",5/10,"The BMW M8 Gran Coupe is a larger, more practical version of the M8 Coupe that comes with the same 625hp engine, but gets a more practical four-door body with a roomier boot and four seats. So, if you want an M car, but have too many friends, BMW has your back. Audi and Porsche have also got your back, though, because the Audi RS7 and Porsche Panamera also provide the same blend of coupe styling with two rows of seats and monumental performance. To help you tell it apart from the standard BMW 8 Series Gran Coupe , it gets more aggressive bumpers, four large exhaust pipes, new alloy wheels and plenty of optional carbon fibre details. Inside, you get lashings of leather trim on the doors, dashboard and seats, and the same brilliant iDrive Professional infotainment system and digital driver’s display as in the 8 Series. The Gran Coupe is quite a bit longer than the 8 Series Coupe and the widest car that BMW currently makes, so space inside for four adults is good. Those in that front can stretch out, while only the very tall will complain about headroom in the rear. The Gran Coupe’s large rear central console makes carrying a middle passenger difficult, mind. Its boot is smaller and more awkwardly shape than alternative efforts too. It doesn’t have great access, there’s a large lip to lift bags over and it has ridged sides that don’t make efficient use of the space. We fitted six carry-on cases inside, but a Panamera or RS7 will fit more. Under the BMW M8 Gran Coupe’s bonnet, you’ll find a 625hp version of the twin-turbo V8 in the M850i. This unit comes with plenty of parts shared with the BMW M5 Competition, including a grippy four-wheel-drive system that’ll blast the M8 Gran Coupe from 0-62mph in around three seconds. Performance isn’t a problem and neither is going around corners, because the M8 feels far more nimble than it should be given its size in its most aggressive drive modes. Even so, if you really value a pure driving experience, there are better (smaller) M cars on offer. The Gran Coupe also feels firm all of the time, which does get a little tiring and goes against its large luxury feel. But the main issue we have with the M8 Gran Coupe is that for a staggering wad of cash less, the M850i version provides 95% of the thrills with 100% of the luxury, not to mention a healthy dose more comfort too. However, if it has to be the M8, head over to our BMW deals page and used BMW page to see how much you can save on one. Be sure to see how you can sell your car online through carwow to make space for your BMW M8 Gran Coupe, too."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/z4,BMW Z4 Review & Prices,"£46,510",7/10,"This is the BMW Z4, a convertible sports car that’s a bit more grown up and refined than some of its alternatives. It’s like an older married couple sipping gin and tonic at the wedding bar, while the Porsche 718 Boxster and Audi TT Roadster are like the energetic kids careening around the dancefloor and skidding on their knees. That’s not to say that BMW Z4 isn’t fun to drive. Particularly in more powerful M40i guise – there’s also a slightly uninspiring sDrive20i model – it’s a brawny performance car with an engine that barks angrily as it catapults you down the road. But point it at a twisty road and it’s not quite as agile as the Porsche and the Audi , which feel small enough to tackle tight British countryside roads and give you confidence that the tyres have loads of grip in corners. The BMW feels bigger and, while it has loads of clever tech to make it handle well, feels like it’s floating over the road rather than biting into the surface. If you’re looking for a sporty road car that would be just as happy on a race track, the Z4 doesn’t quite hit the mark. It lacks that giggle-inducing character the 718 Boxster and TT have. But where it excels is, well, just about everywhere else. The suspension is comfortable enough to cruise about town without jolting you around at every hint of a pothole, and despite the fabric roof, it’s quiet enough to have a conversation with your passenger even at motorway speeds. And sure, the interior doesn’t quite have the visual drama of the exterior (which is properly head-turning, particularly in the gorgeous Portimao Blue paint), but it’s all very functional and trimmed to the highest quality. You also get one of the best infotainment systems in the business; it’s closer to a cosy 3 Series than a pared back sports car. Naturally, the 3 Series comparisons fall apart when it comes to space and practicality, but compared with similar cars you’re not too cramped and there are some useful cubby holes, while the boot is the same capacity as the TT Roadster and bigger than you’ll find in the Porsche. The BMW Z4 is a two-seater, though, so if you want rear seats you could consider the Ford Mustang Convertible or BMW’s own 4 Series Convertible . Ultimately, the BMW Z4 is a fantastic all-round sports car. It doesn’t quite have the cornering prowess of alternatives, but it has more than enough ability to put a smile on your face. And if you’re looking for a comfortable, posh convertible to make the most of sunny road trips, it’s a fantastic option.

https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/x3,BMW X3 Review & Prices,"£50,185",8/10,"The BMW X3 is an incredibly popular family SUV - more than 3.5 million have been sold since it launched in 2003. The latest model aims to stand out with its striking exterior design, ultra-modern interior and new plug-in hybrid engine. Both upmarket and eco-conscious, then, it’s like eating at a Nobu restaurant and ordering the vegan option. It’s one of BMW’s core SUV models, being larger than the X1 but smaller than the X5 - a true family SUV, making it an alternative to cars such as the Audi Q5 , Mercedes GLC , Volvo XC60 and Alfa Romeo Stelvio . At the same time, many growing families may be looking to increasingly posh offerings from less upmarket brands as a way to get more bang for their buck - think the Hyundai Santa Fe or Volkswagen Tiguan . The old X3 did look a bit like it had been designed by a committee, starting with a generic SUV shape and just pasting on BMW’s signature features such as the kidney grilles and quad headlights. The new model is much more distinctive, with a very clean look helped in no small part by ditching the black plastic cladding that used to adorn the wheel arches. There’s also an eye-catching new grille which has a mixture of diagonal and vertical lines - though racier models get a more conventional look - and which can even be illuminated by a thin LED strip around the outside. The sides are smooth, with faint sculpting giving the suggestion of a wheel arch, and recessed door handles mean there’s nothing to protrude. It’s a similar story at the rear, which has a smooth tailgate and big, angular LED taillights. Inside it’s an even bigger change. There’s a large twin-screen infotainment setup and an interesting knitted texture on the dashboard, though it’s great to see BMW’s retained some of the features we love such as the rotary controller for the infotainment system that makes it much easier to use on the move than a pure touchscreen. The most obvious feature, though, is that where BMWs of old may have used tons of chrome trim, in the new X3 it’s largely been replaced with huge hunks of translucent plastic through which sophisticated ambient lighting shines. It’s quite effective, particularly at night, but it’s definitely an acquired taste and does highlight that the interior doesn’t feel quite as luxuriously built as the old car, with some quite cheap and nasty materials around. It’s also not hugely spacious for family life. The front seats are roomy but the rears are only average, and there’s a big hump in the floor which makes the centre seat quite uncomfortable. The boot is a good size at 570 litres, marginally larger than an Audi Q5 or Alfa Romeo Stelvio, but it’s beaten easily by a Mercedes GLC or a VW Tiguan. Storage for smaller items is also a bit limited. There are four engines to choose from in the UK. There’s a 2.0-litre petrol or 2.0-litre diesel, both of which provide plenty of performance for everyday life. The most interesting is the 30e plug-in hybrid, which has up to 56 miles of all-electric range - meaning low company car tax bills and big potential fuel savings. All of these models are fairly pleasant to drive with comfortable suspension and refined engines, though they’re not quite as enjoyable as the old X3 was. At the top of the range there’s a rapid M50 model, which has a 3.0-litre six-cylinder engine and plenty of performance upgrades making it a totally different car to drive. This version of the X3 takes aim at the Audi SQ5 and Mercedes-AMG GLC 43 and does so pretty well, thanks to tidy driving dynamics and plenty of performance. If this glam new SUV looks like the car for you then check out our best BMW X3 deals right here. You can get a great deal on another BMW model here, or find a used BMW for sale here. Remember Carwow can even help you to sell your old car when the time comes for car-changing."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/2-series-coupe,BMW 2 Series Coupe Review & Prices,"£38,980",8/10,"They say good things come in small packages – well, the BMW 2 Series Coupe must be a very good thing, because while cars keep getting bigger and bigger, it has remained impressively dainty by comparison. It’s like a tricky winger on a football pitch of lumbering centre backs. As such, there aren’t too many obvious alternatives to consider beyond the Audi TT . The Toyota GR86 is cheaper (if you can find one) but has a sportier focus and less fancy interior, while the Toyota Supra and Ford Mustang are a good chunk more expensive. You wouldn’t immediately know it from looking at the BMW 2 Series, though. It looks fantastic (from the front, at least) with bulging bodywork and narrow, focused headlights that leave no doubts about its sporty character. The back is a bit more aesthetically challenging, a touch reminiscent of Sid the sloth from the Ice Age movies… It’s more conventional inside, though personal preference will determine whether that’s a good thing or not, because the design is a touch plain. There can be no complaints about the interior’s quality, with everything feeling well put together and posh to the touch. The infotainment system is top notch, too. By two-door coupe standards the 2 Series is fairly practical, but it’s not for people who regularly drive around with a car full of mates. There are small cubby holes here and there and a space to wirelessly charge your phone, and while passenger space up front is decent, those in the back will find it rather tighter. At least the boot, at 390 litres, is bigger than the Audi TT, and beaten only by the Ford Mustang. Cars like this are not bought for their practicality, they’re bought for putting a smile on your face out on the open road, and here the BMW 2 Series delivers. There are two petrol engines, called 220i and 230i at 184hp and 245hp respectively (as well as the sportier M240i and M2 models reviewed separately), and the 230i we tested delivered strong acceleration to go with the impressive levels of grip in corners. Okay, so it’s not a proper hardcore sports car, but if you’re looking for a fun road car the 2 Series is a fantastic option. Its diminutive stature means it’s not intimidating to thread down a tight country road and the car turns into corners quickly, so it’s fun and responsive even at normal speeds. It’s a bit jiggly over bumps, but forward visibility is good and the controls are pretty light, so if you’re willing to sacrifice a little comfort, it’s easy to drive around town. There’s a bit of road noise at motorway speeds, but nothing intrusive enough to be annoying.

https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/x4-m,BMW X4 M Competition Review & Prices,"£97,905",7/10,"If you’re a Formula 1 driver with a family, what do you drive? The BMW X4 M Competition might be just the trick. For starters, it’s savagely quick and more fun to drive than you might expect, yet it’ll also do a good job of hauling luggage. It isn’t the only option, mind: a Mercedes-AMG GLC 63 S Coupe offers similar pace and space with a sloping silhouette. There’s no mistaking an X4 M Competition for just any old X4. It gets a gloss black grille, aggressive M front bumper with huge air intakes and BMW’s bold Icon LED headlights at the front. At the sides, you’ll find 21-inch M-specific alloy wheels over larger M brakes and M door mirrors finished in gloss black, while at the rear, there’s another M bumper with diffuser, M sports exhaust with gloss black tailpipes and M Competition badging. Oh, and there are rear spoilers mounted on the roof and boot lip. Inside, the M-fest continues. There are figure-hugging electric, heated M Sport seats in fancy Merino leather that come with five free leather colour choices as well as one two-tone as an option. Then there’s an M Sports steering wheel with two red M driving mode buttons, a red starter button, door sill finishers in gloss black, M seatbelts and a newly designed M gear selector. All-told the X4 M’s interior leaves you in no doubt as to its sporting intentions, but it’s also very high quality throughout. Plus, BMW’s last-generation (but still fantastic) iDrive infotainment system with a 10-inch screen on the dash, digital dials and head-up display with M-specific design and driving mode info is all standard. BMW still doesn’t include Apple CarPlay as standard, though, and Android Auto isn’t even available. While there’s plenty of space for adults around those sports seats, rear seat space isn’t quite so good. Legroom is generous, but the BMW X4 M’s raked roofline means that anybody over six foot tall will find headroom tight – something the boxier X3 M doesn’t suffer. Of course, kids will be fine, but the rear windows are also quite shallow so they may feel claustrophobic. The X4’s boot, too, is only 50-litres smaller than the X3’s, but is a shallower, more awkward space. However, the X4 M gives nothing away to the X3 M on the engine front: both are fitted with BMW’s savage twin-turbocharged 3.0-litre straight-six petrol which develops 510hp. Via a brilliant standard eight-speed automatic gearbox and clever all-wheel-drive system , that means an official 0-62mph time of just 4.1 seconds, which is officially slower than a Mercedes-AMG GLC 63 S Coupe – although we managed under four seconds when we tried it ourselves. The X4 M is also every bit as great as the Mercedes at going around corners for such a big SUV . Thanks to that clever all-wheel-drive system, a trick rear differential that distributes power to the rear wheel with the most grip, a stiffened body and stiffer suspension, it turns into corners keenly and remains composed throughout. It’ll even break traction and get playful if you want to explore its limits further. It’s no BMW M4 in the bends, but it isn’t far off. The BMW X4 M Competition’s biggest problem? The BMW X3 M Competition. The X3 is just as high quality inside, as fast and agile, but cheaper to buy and more spacious and practical, making it a better choice for more people. Still, if you prefer the X4 M’s looks and don’t need the extra room, check out our latest BMW deals and used BMWs for sale for our best prices. Be sure to also see how you can make space for your new BMW X4 M by selling your current car through carwow ."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/4-series-convertible,BMW 4 Series Convertible Review & Prices,"£52,690",8/10,"The BMW 4 Series Convertible is a posh drop-top that goes up against roofless versions of the Mercedes C-Class Coupe and Audi A5 . It’s a hoot to drive on a twisty road, can seat four adults in reasonable comfort, and makes for a rather fantastic long-distance cruiser – and updates coming in 2024 should only improve things. Provided you can get on board with that buck-toothed front end (comparisons have been made to everything from an angry beaver to the original Predator), you’ll find it to be a very tough car to dislike. Think of it like you would a plate of haggis: it might not look too appetising on the surface, but give it a chance and you’ll find that it’s properly delicious. There are a number of reasons for this. For starters, its cabin is a really plush, comfortable place to spend time (at least it is up front). Practically all the surfaces that are directly in your eyeline are finished in expensive feeling leather or other soft-touch materials; and everything feels really well-screwed together. The infotainment system is tip-top, there’s decent storage, and the front seats are really comfy too. Of course, with only two doors instead of four, climbing into the back seats is a bit more of an effort than it is in the regular 3 Series saloon to which this car is so closely related, and there isn’t as much passenger space back there either. Boot space also takes a pretty hefty hit because of the folding roof, but there’s still enough room for four adults and a small amount of weekend luggage to fit inside in reasonable comfort. Still, that slight dip in practicality is easy enough to forgive when you get it out on the road. As with the 4 Series Coupe , you can have the drop-top model with a couple of four-cylinder petrol and diesel engines (there’s a six-cylinder diesel too), as well as a smooth, powerful six-cylinder petrol model called the M440i xDrive. We opted for the latter for our test drive, and if you can stomach the near £60,000 asking price and heightened fuel consumption, then you should. Not only does it lend the 4 Series fantastic pace in a straight line, the 374hp engine also sounds great when you’ve got the roof down and (not too much) wind in your hair. It rides well, too. Our range-topping M440i gets adaptive dampers as standard, which let you choose between a softer suspension setting for motorway cruising; or a firmer set-up for when you want to have a bit of fun on a twisty road. It’s a pretty fantastic driving machine in both environments, so it’s a pity that the lower-rung models don’t get the adaptive dampers as standard. Instead, they get BMW’s fixed M Sport set up, which is a bit on the firm side at low speeds. You’ll have to fork out £2,300 for the M Sport Pro Pack if you want those fancy adaptive dampers, and the desirable (but expensive) options list doesn’t end there. Adaptive cruise control comes as part of the £3650 Technology Plus Pack; and the Comfort Pack (which includes a heated steering wheel and a wind deflector) is £1350. All of that makes the BMW 4 Series Convertible a pretty pricey car – particularly if you opt for the range-topping M440i xDrive and add in a few options. But it’s tough to deny just how enjoyable it is to drive in practically all environments. So if you can get on board with the toothy looks, then why not take a look at our BMW 4 Series Convertible deals to see how much you can save through carwow? You can also check out our latest used BMWs and see how you can sell your car online through carwow."

That’s a busy schedule, but on this evidence, they’ve managed it. They’re not the only tired engineers around, mind. The Mercedes-AMG GLC 63 S , Alfa Romeo Stelvio Quadrofoglio and Audi SQ5 all exist the meet the same , albeit niche, requirements.

There are plenty of sharp angles and creases in the bodywork that give it a distinctive appearance, though base models get softer styling that looks a bit plain. There can be no complaints about the interior though, because it’s a lovely place to eat up miles. The seats are soft and there are quality materials throughout, and all trim levels get the same high quality twin-screen infotainment displays. They look great with clear graphics, though the menus can be really confusing to navigate around. Range: 279 - 343 miles Efficiency: 3.0 - 3.7 miles/kWh Battery size: 84kWh Max charge speed: 205kW Charge time AC: 12h 30mins, 0-100%, 7.4kW Charge time DC: 30mins, 10-80%, 205kW Charge port location: Right side rear Power outputs: 340hp / 601hp It’s spacious too, with plenty of adjustment to get yourself comfortable – you don’t get the same commanding view as an SUV , but the upside is that you feel more snug within the cockpit, rather than sat atop it. Storage is good in the front and there’s loads of room in the back seats, too. The main advantage of the estate body shape is that the BMW i5 Touring has a big boot – at 570 litres it should be enough space for the vast majority of people, and more space than any of the electric SUVs mentioned above, though the VW ID7 Tourer estate has more space still if you really need it. There are two motor options to choose between, with the eDrive40 being the more affordable car to buy and to run, with a top-of-the-range M60 also available with ludicrous performance at the expense of range. As such, the eDrive40 can go up to 348 miles between charges, compared with 314 miles for the M60, which puts it behind what alternatives such as the Audi A6 Avant e-tron (437 miles) and Polestar 3 (403 miles) are capable of. Regardless, the way the BMW i5 Touring chews through those miles is incredibly impressive, because it’s one of the most comfortable, quiet and refined cars on sale today. You feel utterly cocooned from the outside world. That means it’s a great motorway cruiser, but also means pothole-riddled inner-city roads and bumpy B-roads do little to unsettle the car. It’s fairly composed going around corners, with little in the way of body roll, but you really do feel its weight, so it’s not a car that encourages you to drive it like a sports car. However, if you’re looking for a comfortable and refined car to cruise around in, the BMW i5 Touring has very few weak points, most of which are worthy sacrifices for something so comfortable and practical.

https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/2-series-gran-coupe,BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe Review & Prices,"£33,435",7/10,"This is the BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe – a small family car that’s based on the 1 Series hatchback, but shares its name with the 2 Series Coupe . It gets swoopy coupe looks but four doors for added practicality. Confused yet? Like a teenager picking a baffling variety of GCSE subjects, the 2 Series Gran Coupe doesn’t know what it wants to be. Not that that means it’s the only small, four-door saloon -shaped family car out there. You might also consider the Audi A3 Saloon and Mercedes A-Class Saloon , for example. The BMW is arguably the least handsome of that trio, though. The styling has been updated with sharper headlights and a new-look grille, but it still has slightly awkward proportions, like a bigger car’s design has been draped over a small car and it doesn’t quite fit properly. Like a toddler wearing his dad’s suit. Inside there can be no such complaints. You get the twin-screen setup found in bigger, pricier BMWs, and it runs the latest operating software, so you get snappy responses and sharp displays. Temperature controls are now in the screen too, which is annoying, but it’s one of the easier-to-use examples of this setup. The driving position is excellent if you’re after a sporty feel. You sit low to the ground but visibility is still pretty good, and you’re surrounded by quality materials. A Mercedes A-Class Saloon’s cabin is a bit more visually stimulating, but the BMW is classier and feels much posher. Practicality is a bit less impressive. Space is okay in the front – it’s not exactly roomy, yet not claustrophobic as you might expect of a car of this size – but those in the back will find headroom limited, and bulky child seats will be a squeeze. Meanwhile, the boot is smaller than the A-Class Saloon and A3 Saloon. You have a choice of two petrol engines in the regular 2 Series Gran Coupe – the 220 has 170hp and front-wheel drive, while the 223 gets 218hp and all-wheel drive. There’s also the sportier M235, which bumps power up to 300hp. On the road the 2 Series Gran Coupe is easy to drive – while its small dimensions mean it’s not hugely practical, it does make it much less intimidating to drive than bigger family cars, and means you can enjoy narrow, twisty roads without worrying about whether you actually fit between the lines. The suspension is on the sporty side of comfortable, so you do feel bumps in the road but you don’t feel like you need a chiropractor on speed dial. Meanwhile, at motorway speeds it’s quiet and refined, so there’s no need to worry about taking this small car on a long trip. There’s a lot to like about the BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe – the thing is, if you’ve got a young family and want a BMW saloon, the 3 Series does everything better. If budget is an issue, you might want to consider a used BMW 3 Series instead. If this pint-sized saloon suits your needs, check out the latest BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe deals available through Carwow. You can also browse used 2 Series Gran Coupes , as well as other used BMWs from our network of trusted dealers. When it’s time to sell your current car , Carwow can help with that, too."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/i8-roadster,BMW i8 Roadster Review and Prices,"£127,215",8/10,"The BMW i8 Roadster is a convertible version of the futuristic i8 Coupe. It packs supercar-like performance into an eye-catching package that’s sure to attract even more attention at the local petrol station than the likes of the Honda NSX and Audi R8 Spyder. Not that you’ll need to refuel the i8 Roadster very often – it is a hybrid after all. Fully charge its batteries (which you can do in three hours using a dedicated wall charger) and you can drive for around 30 miles in electric-only mode. When the batteries have run out of juice – or put your foot down to accelerate hard – the 1.5-litre turbo petrol engine starts up instantly to lend a hand. Together, they produce 374hp – enough to sprint the i8 Roadster from 0-62mph in 4.6 seconds and on to a 155mph top speed. In Sport mode, the petrol engine stays running the whole time which helps make the BMW feel even more responsive on a twisty country road. As an added bonus, it also recharges the batteries on the move and produces some sporty crackles and wooshes that sound terrific – especially with the roof down. If it starts raining, don’t worry – you can raise the roof electrically at up to 30mph. It does an excellent job of muting any unpleasant wind noise at motorway speeds and leaves enough headroom inside for you to get comfortable, even if you’re over six-feet tall. The Roadster’s frenetic 1.5-litre petrol engine makes it sound a bit like you’re being chased by an irate hot hatch every time you push the accelerator – especially with the roof down Speaking of space inside, the i8 Roadster doesn’t get a pair of back seats like the coupe. Instead, you get a more usable luggage storage shelf that’s big enough to carry three large soft bags. Combine this with an extra storage bin under the BMW’s engine cover and you actually get slightly more luggage space in the Roadster than in the hard-top. Identical to the coupe, however, is the roadster’s cabin design. Its simple, minimalist layout means everything’s easy to use and plenty of plush leather and brushed metal trims make sure it feels much posher inside than the likes of the Honda NSX. You also get one of the most intuitive infotainment systems around and a cool digital driver’s display instead of conventional analogue dials as standard. Other high-tech features fitted as standard include automatic emergency braking that’ll perform an emergency stop if it detects an obstacle in the road ahead. The i8 hasn’t been crash-tested by Euro NCAP, but features such as this help make it a very safe sports car, and one of the very best hybrid performance cars on sale."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/m2,BMW M2 Review & Prices,"£68,705",9/10,"The new M2 is BMW doing what it does best. It’s a small, front-engined, rear-wheel drive sports car that will bring a smile to the face of any petrolhead. If the BMW M240i is an iPhone 14, the M2 is the full-fat iPhone 14 Pro Max. You’ll probably be considering the M2 if you’re also looking at hardcore performance cars such as the Mercedes-AMG CLA 45 S and Audi RS3 , or even premium-badged sports cars like the Porsche 718 Cayman . You won’t be mistaking the M2 for a standard 2 Series Coupe in a hurry. It has a much more aggressive-looking front bumper, huge flared wheel arches and a deeper rear bumper with quad tailpipes, as well as 19-inch alloys up front and 20-inch wheels at the rear. Under the bonnet you’ll find the same 3.0-litre twin-turbocharged six-cylinder engine as the BMW M3 and M4 but with less power. It puts out 460hp and 550Nm of torque, enough for a 0-60mph sprint time of 4.1 seconds. We managed to beat that with an impressive 3.9 seconds, though. If you’re looking at an M2 you’ll probably appreciate some nerdy details. It gets M4/M3 axles to increase its width and a limited-slip differential to help it put the power down out of a corner. It has stiffer suspension springs, adaptive dampers as standard and anti-roll bars to improve handling. Right, enough nerding out. What else do you need to know? Well, one way the M2 separates itself from the cheaper M240i is that it’s available with a six-speed manual gearbox, making it one of the only hardcore performance cars left with three pedals. Unlike the M240i, the M2 is only available with rear-wheel-drive rather than all-wheel power delivery. While we admire BMW for keeping the manual alive, we actually prefer the eight-speed automatic here. It shifts quickly and makes the M2 easier to drive in traffic, while the manual has a rubbery shift action that’s not particularly satisfying to use. Still, it gives the M2 a unique selling point next to the auto- and all-wheel drive-only Mercedes -AMG CLA 45 S and Audi RS3. Although the M2 gets slightly firmer suspension than other 2 Series models, it deals with bumps in the road really well, so you don’t have to sacrifice too much comfort in day to day driving. Visibility in the 2 Series Coupe is decent too, and the M2 gets a reversing camera as standard to make parking manoeuvres that bit easier. What about the practical stuff? After all, a car like this needs to work on the weekly shopping trip and boring commute, too. Up front the M2 is plenty spacious enough, with the standard seats offering loads of adjustability to get comfortable. If you want to up the sportiness, the M2 is available with some lovely-looking carbon fibre bucket seats. These are the same as those offered in the BMW M3, which hold you in place really well. You might find they’re rather snug if you have a larger build, while the ridge between your legs can be annoying if you indulge in some heel-and-toe action in the manual. Space in the rear is pretty good for a sporty coupe, with a couple of adults able to sit comfortably, though they might feel a bit cramped for longer journeys. Those looking to carry people in the back regularly will be much better off with a four-door Audi RS3, which has both Sportback (i.e. hatchback ) and Saloon body styles. As for boot space, there’s 390 litres on offer in the M2. That’s 70 litres less than the Mercedes-AMG CLA 45 S, however it is 59 litres more than you get in an Audi RS3 saloon. Interior storage is also decent, with a useful centre console cubby, a decent-sized glovebox and some usable cup holders. The cabin itself is more or less identical to the M240i, with the exception of a manual gear stick poking out of the centre console, if you go for that option. This means everything feels really solid, with plenty of soft-touch materials around the place and a modern design. That said, a Porsche Cayman feels a bit more special. The new BMW M2 gets a huge, curved display that dominates the dash. It consists of a 12.3-inch digital driver’s display and a 14.9-inch central touchscreen, the same as you’ll find in most new BMW models these days. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto both come as standard, and the system is really easy to use. You have the option to use it as a touchscreen, which is better while you're stationary, or there’s a choice of voice commands or a swivel wheel in the centre console, which work better while driving. The BMW M2 is a fantastic sports car, and although its price (and weight) have swelled, it goes a long way to justify that with a fantastic driving experience. Want one? Check out the latest BMW M2 deals . You can also browse a range of used BMWs through Carwow, or take a look at used examples of the outgoing M2 .

https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/8-series-convertible,BMW 8 Series Convertible Review & Prices,"£94,030",8/10,"The BMW 8 Series Convertible is the solution to a problem that’s nice to have: how to blast from the UK to the south of France quickly but comfortably, enjoy an Alpine pass along the way, but also bask in the warm Mediterranean sun upon arrival. If that’s what you woke up worrying about this morning, BMW has your answer. But it isn’t necessarily the only answer. There are other luxurious open-top GT cars that’ll scythe their way to Saint Tropez with similar speed and grace. The best of those include the Bentley Continental GT Convertible and Mercedes S-Class Cabriolet . And it’s fair to say the 8 Series doesn’t have quite the presence of those cars. It’s hardly a shrinking violet with its prominent grille and steeply raked windscreen, but you’d wager the Bentley and Mercedes will turn more heads. It’s the same inside – the 8 Series’ cabin is slick and high quality, but it lacks the sheer pizzazz of its rivals. It has a better infotainment system , though. The most advanced version of BMW’s fantastic iDrive comes as standard and includes a 10-inch screen which can be controlled via a rotary dial between the front seats, physical touch or using your voice. It’ll also respond to hand gestures and comes with a handy Personal Assistant feature that’ll do everything from adjust the climate control to find your favourite restaurant. All you need to do is say ‘hey BMW’ and ask the question. Where the 8 Series Convertible is less adept is with space. Not in the front, mind, where the driver gets a huge amount of electric seat and wheel adjustment and both front passengers enjoy superbly supportive sports seats. No, it’s the back seats which are the issue – anybody with legs will seriously struggle to stay comfortable on even short journeys. Sure, the Bentley and Mercedes are hardly MPVs , but they do offer slightly more rear space. At least the 8 Series’ boot is on a par with the Bentley and Mercedes at 350 litres, although that’s with its fabric roof up. With it down (which takes just 15 seconds up to 31mph) some of that space is robbed to store it. So, where a large suitcase plus some soft bags will fit on a rainy day, you’ll have to rethink your outfits if you want the wind in your hair. And you will, especially if you go for the 530hp M850i petrol which sounds superb with its sports exhaust when testing its staggering 3.2 second 0-62mph sprint time. The only other engine option is a 333hp 840i, which is a touch less engaging. It’s still fast though (0-62mph arrives in 5.5 seconds) and will use less fuel. Open top cars (especially big ones like the 8 Series) are usually noticeably less rigid to drive than cars with roofs, because quite literally there’s nothing solid connecting them up top. This normally results in some shuddering through the body over bumps, but not here, because you’d struggle to tell any difference in comfort at low speeds around town. And the same goes on a country road, where the Convertible’s standard all-wheel drive and rear wheel steering help it feel just as agile as the 8 Series Coupe. Particularly the M850i, where BMW’s M division has been involved in its suspension, plus it gets a clever differential for better distribution of power to the road. Then, when you aren’t in the mood, roof-closed the 8 Series Convertible remains quiet on the motorway too, making it a thoroughly well-rounded car. It’s high-quality, has great tech, is relaxing to drive but also fun when you want it to be. It even looks good value next to the Bentley and Mercedes. That is, of course, relatively speaking. Indeed, the 8 Series Convertible certainly requires deep pockets (even deeper if you go for the petrol version) and there are more spacious open-top GT cars, but if you have the budget and don’t need the space, the 8 Series Convertible makes a superb open-top GT.

https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/7-series,BMW 7 Series Review & Prices,"£105,620",8/10,"The BMW 7 Series is the flagship saloon of the German brand, and it showcases the latest tech that the firm has to offer. In this case, it’s got a fleet of improved technology inside, such as the optional cinema style screen in the back – like having your own private Odeon. But the main story with the 7 Series is its controversial new design. The large grille dominates the front, while it’s flanked by split headlights, which certainly divides opinion, but looks better in the metal. The sharp design continues down the side with some creases, but it’s slab-sided otherwise. At the rear it’s classic 7 Series with a modern twist. It’s pretty square but it gets thin lights to get that futuristic look. The all-electric BMW i7 that sits alongside the 7 Series gets blue highlights all round the vehicle, including on the rear bumper. Inside, you’ll find one of the fanciest cabins currently on sale. You get a huge panel containing both screens, one of which is the infotainment touchscreen that can be controlled by the iDrive dial. You also get loads of crystal detailing you may have seen in the BMW iX SUV, including a whole panel that lights up depending on different functions, such as the climate control. With luxury trimmings and excellent build quality, the 7 Series manages to be as accomplished as a Mercedes S-Class . It’s not quite as luxurious as the electric i7 though. The rear seats are like you’re on a business class flight, and you can get seats that recline to give a properly relaxing experience. You get touchscreen displays to control the optional widescreen that folds down from the roof, as well as the seats and air conditioning. It’s high-end limousine luxury at its finest. If you’re all about having a practical saloon, the 7 Series does okay with a 525-litre load area. The all-electric i7 gets slightly less with 500 litres. However, the Mercedes equivalents – the S-Class and EQS – get 550 litres and 610 litres respectively. And with the 7 Series and i7, you can’t fold the seats down to load longer items. Out on the road, the 7 Series feels super composed. Weighing north of two tonnes, it’s not light, but with the standard adaptive air suspension it rides smoothly and with little fuss. It disguises its weight well when going through the corners too. Around town, it is pretty long at 5.3m, but with the help of rear-wheel steering, it feels surprisingly manoeuvrable. There’s no hiding the fact that it’s a large car though, so thank goodness for the multiple cameras, making parking pretty simple. But where the 7 Series is peerless is cruising on the motorway. In the UK, we only get the 750e and M760e versions – both of which are plug-in hybrids offering up to 49 miles of electric driving. The electric punch matched with excellent engines should make overtaking and getting up to speed no problem. The BMW 7 Series is one of the best cars you can currently buy, and with its luxury appeal, it can definitely match the Mercedes S-Class in the premium limo market.

https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/m5-touring,BMW M5 Touring Review & Prices,"£113,515",8/10,"The combination of ‘M5’ and ‘Touring’ is legendary in performance car circles, because BMW has only applied the estate car treatment to three generations of the M5 super-saloon since it was launched in 1984. And yes, that includes the latest G90 model M5. The new G99 generation M5 Touring manages to be both a sledgehammer and a scalpel. It appears unwieldy, with its immense size and power, yet it’s shockingly precise and easy to use - though it can still get you into trouble if you’re not careful. While it has lost its supercar-style, high-revving, naturally aspirated engine over the years, the latest M5 features a frankly absurd 727hp, twin-turbocharged, 4.4-litre V8 hybrid engine under the bonnet. 0-62mph is dispatched in just 3.6 seconds, 0.1 seconds slower than the M5 saloon , but considering the Touring weighs more than an X5 M Competition SUV …or a small moon…that’s still some going. On the subject of super-SUVs, it’s not just the likes of the Audi RS6 Avant and Mercedes-AMG E53 Estate that you might cross-shop the M5 Touring with; there’s a huge variety of high-performance, high-practicality alternatives on sale. The Porsche Cayenne Turbo, Taycan Sport Turismo and the Range Rover Sport SV all offer a combination of rapid pace and dog-friendly boot space, for example. The M5 Touring is an enormous car, the same size as a 7 Series was not too long ago, with some outlandish styling features such as the oversized, light-up grille and bulging wheel arches. The LED headlights look almost too small and the rear diffuser too big, but there’s no denying that the M5 is aggressive through and through - and the Touring’s design is far more coherent than the saloon’s. Inside is much like a standard 5 Series though, with only the small flash of M-ness to remind you of what you’re driving. There’s a strip of red at the top of the steering wheel and red accents on the shift paddles and start button, and a pair of delightful M5-specific seats at the front, but aside from that you may as well be sitting in a 520i. That’s no bad thing considering BMW’s swish curved touchscreen setup and high material quality, but the infotainment is a bit of a faff to navigate with all of its menus, sub-menus and a lack of physical buttons. There’s plenty of room inside for all passengers, and a pair of wireless phone charging pads under the touchscreen are useful, but with your phone in situ there’s not that much storage space in the M5’s cabin. The door pockets are a decent size, but the centre console cubby is rather shallow, and it’s frustrating having to use the cupholders to store odds and sods in. Boot space is down when compared to every other 5 Series Touring on sale - including the electric i5 model - at only 500 litres. Something has to give when squeezing a hybrid battery and electronic differential into a family car, and in this case it’s the depth of the cargo area. There’s an optional electronically retractable tow bar and a 2000kg towing weight, should you be inclined to tow your classic E30 M3 race car about, for example. The M5 has lost none of its performance prowess in the name of practicality. Never mind the 0-62mph time, it’s the way in which the M5 hides its weight on a country road which amazes. With a slew of adaptive drive settings for the engine, gearbox, suspension and even brakes, you can set the M5 up to suit your driving style and have a whale of a time when the going gets twisty. Motorways are serene as it glides at high speeds in its softest settings, but it does feel stiff over broken city roads. The M5 avoids feeling crashy through potholes, but you can tell it’s a performance car by the way it’s shaken about in dips and over bumps.

It’s spacious, practical, has a lovely cabin, great infotainment and is fast yet comfy. Oh, this focus group all live in Monaco, by the way. Yep, the X5 M Competition is watery-eye expensive. More than £100,000 expensive. It isn’t alone, however, because it competes with other blisteringly quick large SUVs such as the Mercedes-AMG GLE 63 and Porsche Cayenne , which aren’t exactly budget cars. You can’t be the shy and retiring type to own an X5 M Competition, with its gaping black grille, huge air intakes, huge wheels, large exhausts and vivid unique paint colours helping it stand out over the standard X5. And, if by some miracle you’d missed the exterior, the X5 M Competition’s interior is every bit as in-your-face. Think seriously figure-hugging seats with quilted stitching, aluminium trim, sports pedals and ambient lighting. Of course, there’s the chance to up the ante with BMW’s options list, but a superb fit and finish are standard. One thing that stays the same versus stand X5s is the infotainment system, although it’s one of the best in the business. It’s BMW’s top-end Professional system, which gets a 12-inch screen that can be controlled by touch, a rotary dial between the front seats or even a very good voice control system. It also gets Apple CarPlay as standard (with Android Auto to follow in time), although you’ll have to pay for it beyond year one and Mercedes’ digital dials are more visually impressive and configurable than the ones you get as standard in the BMW. Two adults in the front of the BMW X5 M Competition will have no issues with space, and the same goes for another couple of tall adults behind them in the back. The X5 M Competition keeps the standard cars’ huge 650-litre boot too, which has the added benefit of a split tailgate. Elsewhere in the world the BMW X5 M Competition also comes as simply an X5 M with 600hp, but here in the UK it’s the full-fat 625hp Competition model or nothing. That V8 petrol sends this 2.4-tonne behemoth to 62mph from standstill in just 3.8 seconds. That’s supercar fast. And while it won’t lap a track as quickly as BMW’s fastest M cars, the X5 M Competition’s huge tyres, stiff, adaptive suspension, clever differential, extra bracing and quicker steering all help it feel just about as agile as an SUV can, even without the rear-wheel steering of some alternatives. As such, in town, this big SUV doesn’t feel quite so nimble, but on the motorway it’ll breeze down slip roads and overtake faster-moving traffic with a simple twitch of the right foot, all the while remaining more comfortable and quiet than it has any right to be given its sporty intentions. It all sounds great, but it’s worth bearing in mind that the also-V8 BMW X5 M 50i model does 90% of what this M Competition model can do while being vastly cheaper. However, if you have the budget and the need for the pinnacle of BMW SUVs, then the X5 M Competition will satisfy and then some. Make sure you head to our BMW deals page for the very best prices.

https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/3-series-touring,BMW 3 Series Touring Review & Prices,"£43,840",9/10,"If you’re in the market for a practical family car your first thought will probably be to go for an SUV of some kind, but you shouldn’t dismiss humble estate cars such as the BMW 3 Series Touring. You know what to expect with the 3 Series Touring: a spacious, practical car which is comfortable, beautifully made and great fun to drive on a twisty road. It’ll also be cheaper to run than an SUV thanks to its more modest size. It’s a handsome car as well. Sure it doesn’t have quite the same street-cred as a BMW X3 , but the angular nose, massive air intakes and real dual exhaust tips help it stand out against the Mercedes C-Class Estate and Audi A4 Avant , especially if you go for M Sport trim. The cabin is equally impressive. The low-slung seating position is more like a sports car than a roomy estate, and the way the dashboard wraps around you makes it feel even more special. Everything inside also feels plush and solidly built, and you get one of the best infotainment systems in the business. It’s a huge curved display – added for the late 2022 update to the 3-Series – spanning half the dashboard, incorporating a slick touchscreen and a digital driver’s display. So there’s plenty of tech on offer in the 3 Series Touring, and there’s plenty of space inside as well. Those up front will have loads of room to stretch out and taller passengers will be comfortable in the back. That said, the Volvo V60 offers slightly more rear legroom. Fitting a child seat in the rear is no bother as the doors open nice and wide, and there’s acres of room in the boot for all your family clobber. It’s not quite as big as the Skoda Superb Estate , but you’ll easily get a couple of bikes in with the seats folded down. Whatever you decide to put in the back won’t get bounced around either because the 3 Series Touring is nice and smooth over the bumps. The suspension deals with potholes really well whilst also keeping body lean through the bends to a minimum. Go for the M Sport trim level and you get lowered suspension and bigger wheels for an even sportier feeling, but if you do a lot of motorway miles you’ll be better off with the regular car as it’s slightly more comfortable. The 2.0-litre 320i petrol is the best all-round engine choice as it’s smooth and economical, although anyone doing mostly motorway miles could be better off with the fuel-sipping 2.0-litre diesel. Those looking to have the most fun will want the six-cylinder M340i petrol for its blistering pace, but it is pretty thirsty. Company car drivers are also catered for with the 330e plug-in hybrid . An update to the 3 Series range in late 2022 removes any manual gearbox options, with all models getting an eight-speed automatic as standard. Thankfully it’s one of the best ‘boxes around and it helps make heavy traffic far less stressful. The 3 Series’ mid-life facelift also sees some new, slimmer headlights and an altered grille, as well as some new paint schemes and different alloy wheel designs. There’s  an abundance of driver assistance systems available to make long journeys much less tiring, but they do cost extra. On the whole the BMW 3 Series Touring is an excellent family car. It’s practical, comfortable and good fun to drive, but you do have to be prepared to hand over a bit of extra cash for some must-have options such as adaptive cruise control and lumbar support. Do this and you’ll have one of the best estate cars around. Keen on making a BMW 3 Series Touring your next car?

https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/x7-m60i,BMW X7 M60i Review & Prices,"£116,910",8/10,"The BMW X7 M60i is the performance version of the German brand’s seven-seat SUV and comes with refreshed styling like the updated X7 . With a huge M-division V8, it goes up against the likes of the Range Rover SVR, Porsche Cayenne Turbo and Mercedes-AMG G63 . There are plenty of performance SUVs now, but this particular one is practical for families and smart – much like getting a large North Face duffle bag. Looks-wise, the M60i takes the rather bold updated styling of the base X7, then adds some sportiness. Add deeper bumpers, larger inlets and 23-inch alloy wheels, as well as a smattering of M logos, and you’ve got a dynamic-looking SUV. The dynamic feeling continues into the cabin, with carbon fibre, aluminium and leather adorning most of the surfaces. You also get nice ambient lighting throughout, while you can also get the panoramic sunroof with lighting across that as well. You get lots of storage, with big door pockets, a large bin under the armrest and a decent glovebox – although air fresheners do take up some space. As a seven-seater, the adjustable middle row has a good amount of space, whether you have the seats in their forwardmost or rearmost position. There’s a good amount of headroom too, even with a panoramic sunroof. Even in the rearmost seats, you get some decent space. Although headroom isn’t the best, adults can be comfortable, as you also get room for your feet under the seats in front, while there’s also a cupholder and USB chargers, as you do in the middle row. With all seven seats in place, you get 326 litres of luggage space, with a split-folding tailgate offering a handy perch. Folding the rear seats gives you 750 litres behind the middle row. All the seats can be folded down with switches in the rear, and when the middle row is put down, you get a mostly flat space. The seven-seat Range Rover has 818 litres with the rear seats folded down, while the Mercedes GLS has 890 litres. BMW has tweaked the chassis of the X7 with this M60i, and when you take it on a twisty road, you get flat-cornering and an impressive overall driving experience. The suspension is especially impressive, providing lots of balance and the ability to soak bumps up brilliantly. The 4.4-litre twin-turbocharged V8 is also a triumph, giving lots of performance when you need it, while the eight-speed transmission is responsive in sport mode. As you would expect from an expensive SUV with adaptive suspension, you get a comfortable ride around town, and even though the M60i gets rear-wheel steering, the turning circle is 12.4m – larger than a Range Rover’s 11m. It’s not the smallest car either, but the large windows help with visibility. On the motorway, the M60i has plenty of kit to make long-distance journeys smooth, such as adaptive cruise control and lane keep assist. In comfort mode especially, the X7 is an excellent cruiser. It may not be an obvious performance SUV choice, but the X7 M60i is comfortable, has loads of power and plenty of space – even if other options have a bit more space. If you want to get the best deals on the X7 M60i or other new BMW models , you should check out carwow, where you can also get great prices on used BMW models . You can sell your car through carwow as well, with our trusted dealers bidding on your car so you can get the best price."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/1-series,BMW 1 Series Review & Prices,"£31,875",8/10,"The BMW 1 Series is a posh family hatchback with a high-quality cabin and loads of cutting-edge tech. You may also be considering the Audi A3 or Mercedes A-Class if you’re shopping for a premium hatchback, and the 1 Series was updated in 2024 with a new look and an updated cabin. The 1 Series has always been the go-to if you want a premium hatchback with a sporty edge. It’s a bit like choosing a pair of Yeezys over some Dr. Marten loafers. There are very few small cars which feel as posh inside as the BMW 1 Series, and this was only improved during the 2024 update. All the materials feel soft and yielding and everything is really solid. Quality in here is much better than it is in a Mercedes A-Class. The tech you get inside is also really impressive. All cars get a huge curved display atop the dashboard comprising a 10.7-inch touchscreen and a 10.3-inch digital driver’s display, and it’s all very responsive and easy to use. As is the case in most BMWs the driving position is spot on. There’s loads of adjustment in the seats and steering wheel for all drivers big and small to get comfortable. Once you’re ready to go, there are also plenty of cubby holes for you to empty your pockets into. Moving to the rear seats, the space on offer is best described as adequate. If you’re only carrying two people back there then they’ll have enough legroom, however headroom could be a struggle for taller adults. Getting three people back there is also a tight squeeze, and a Volkswagen Golf is more adept at carrying rear passengers. Boot space is also down on some of this car's key competitors. In the basic petrol model you get significantly less space than an Audi A3 or Honda Civic have to offer, however the BMW’s load area is a nice square shape and there isn’t much of a lip to haul items over. As for engines, there are just three on offer and they’re all petrol-powered. Entry-level models get a 1.5-litre three-cylinder with 170hp, then there’s a 2.0-litre with 218hp or the range-topping M135 hot hatchback with 300hp and all-wheel drive. Once you’ve loaded the car up and hit the road, the first thing you’ll notice is that even the entry-level petrol model has a hot hatch feel to it. The steering is responsive and it’s great fun to thread down a country road, though the performance-focused M135 isn't as exciting as the Volkswagen Golf R, even if there's no denying it's fast in a straight line. The sportiness does come at the expense of comfort though, because even the normal 1 Series is a bit firmer than an Audi A3. This is especially apparent around town, where the car jitters around over potholes and broken surfaces. Still, at least the steering is nice and light and you get decent all-round visibility. Things settle down on the motorway, where the cabin feels nice and hushed. There’s just a hint of tyre roar disturbing the peace, but the 1 Series is a relaxing car for covering long distances. So the BMW 1 Series is great to drive, packed with tech and really well-made. Some alternatives are more comfortable though, and quite a lot of features are pricey options. Check out the latest BMW 1 Series deals if you fancy this as your next car and want to save some cash, or browse offers on other BMW models . You can also take a look at used 1 Series’ available now, and don’t forget that you can also sell your current car through Carwow for a great price."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/ix2,BMW iX2 Review & Prices,"£49,365",7/10,"BMW has really made a mark in the electric car market, and the iX2 is the latest addition to its EV stable. As with the petrol-powered X2 , it’s based on the same mechanical package as the iX1 electric SUV, but gets sharper exterior styling that comes a little at the expense of practicality. It’s a bit like sports fleece jackets — the iX1 is a roomy and comfy fleece, designed for practicality, while the iX2 is more sporty and form-fitting, with a tailored look to it. The iX2 is entering a pretty crowded marketplace when it comes to stylish electric SUVs and crossovers — there’s already the choice of the Audi Q4 e-tron Sportback , the Volvo EC40 , and of course the big-selling Tesla Model Y . On the outside, the iX2 looks very much the same as the petrol X2 — if you’re trying to tell them apart, really aside from the badges the only way to do so is to look at the grille, which is blanked-off for the iX2. If you fancy an electric car but maybe don’t fancy making too big a visual statement about it, that could be a good thing for you. Range: 266-282 miles Efficiency: 3.6-3.8 miles per kWh Battery size: 64.8kWh Max charge speed: 130kW Charge time AC: 10hrs 0mins, 0-100%, 7kW Charge time DC: 29mins, 10-80%, 130kW Charge port location: Right rear Power outputs: 204hp / 313hp That sharply-sloping rear roofline certainly marks the iX2 out as being one of the more stylish and dramatic-looking electric SUVs you can buy — it’s definitely more interesting to look at than the slightly blobby Audi or Tesla — but it won’t be to everyone’s taste. Inside, the cabin looks and feels very modern and high-tech, but some of the materials used are too cheap when you’re shopping at the more expensive end of the iX2’s price list. The big, wide, curved-screen layout for the infotainment screen and the driver’s instruments looks great though, and it’s hugely responsive. The layout is fairly easy to find your way around, too, and the on-screen icons are large and easy to press, but there are a few too many complicated sub-menus for some functions. Practicality takes a hit compared to the iX1, as despite the boot being large on paper compared to most alternatives the sloping roof limits the size of loads that you can take. And while the rear seats are really roomy for two adults, the centre seat is almost useless - making the iX2 a four-seater except for very occasional use. BMW sells two versions of the iX2. Although they use the same size of battery, the more powerful all-wheel drive version doesn’t go as far on a charge as the less powerful two-wheel drive version, which can go 282 miles. The iX2 is as quiet and refined as you’d hope from an electric car, but while it does drive well, and can corner hard, there’s maybe not the gap between it and rivals from Volvo and Audi that there used to be. The steering is satisfying, although a little odd at times, and performance is ample. Like the iX1 it’s up there as one of the benchmarks in the sector. If you’re interested, check out the latest BMW iX2 deals on Carwow. You can also check out used BMW iX2s for sale , or other used BMWs here .

https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/x6,BMW X6 Review & Prices,"£79,690",9/10,"The BMW X6 is a bit like Snapchat. When it first appeared, people wondered what the point was. Does anybody need a car that’s part SUV, part coupe? But like Snapchat, the X6 has defied the naysayers to prove quite popular. This large coupe-style SUV has strong engines and seating for five. It’s a sleeker version of the BMW X5 and an alternative to the similarly-styled Mercedes GLE Coupe and Porsche Cayenne Coupe . The X6 has been updated for 2024 but you still get the classic, chunky proportions that you expect from an off-roader, with a rakishly angled roof that echoes the sleek lines of a sports car . As is the trend in recent BMWs, the trademark ‘kidney’ grille is now enormous. It’s also available with illumination, to make it even more, er, eye-catching. Inside the look and feel is very BMW X5, which is a good thing. It has an interesting design but functional button layout and everything feels extremely well put together. It also means you get BMW’s latest twin-screen infotainment system, which looks amazing although some functions are harder to use than before the latest update. There are good and bad points to the X6’s space and practicality. Okay, so you’ll seat four adults just fine inside, but the X6 loses some rear headroom in the name of style compared with the X5, plus its middle seat is quite uncomfortable. The boot is smaller than an X5’s (and the Mercedes ’ or Porsche ’s) and a more awkward shape thanks to its sloping roofline. You’re paying a premium over the X5 for this, remember. There’s a choice of petrol and diesel engines, but the highlight of the range is the performance-focused M60i. This twin-turbo V8 petrol has 530hp and a 0-62mph time of 4.3 seconds. The X6M Competition gives you more power (625hp) for a 0-62mph time of 3.9 seconds. That’s staggering pace for a car of this size and weight, but it is even more expensive to run than the M60i and requires more compromise to comfort. Even the entry-level engines are extremely strong, and given the diesel is the cheapest and most fuel-efficient of the range it makes the most sense. Whichever engine you choose, the X6 feels bulky but comfortable in town and more agile than it has any right to be on a country road given its size. On the motorway, it’s supremely comfy and quiet with the latest driver assistance tech available. The BMW X6 is a mixed bag, then. It’s superb to drive, has a lovely cabin and an eye-candy infotainment system. You’re better off just spending less money on the more practical X5, though, unless you really prefer the X6’s styling and don’t need the space. If that’s the case, you should check out the latest BMW X6 deals on Carwow to see how much money you can save. You can also browse the latest used BMW X6 stock, as well as other used BMWs . When the time comes, you can sell your current car through Carwow , too."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/bmw/x4,BMW X4 Review & Prices,"£54,725",7/10,"The BMW X4 is based on the old X3 , and it’s a sleeker, sportier-looking SUV that tries to convince you that it’s a coupe . It sits between the X2 and the X6 in terms of size, and while it’s not as practical as the X3, it’s arguably the more stylish car. It’s like a chic tote bag instead of a big, roomy suitcase. Not as useful, but rather more fashionable. Inside, the X4 doesn’t have the high-tech, big-screen setup of the new X3, and nor does it have the latest tech boasted by the Mercedes GLC Coupe , but the quality levels are very high and it’s a well-designed cabin. While the X4 doesn’t get the new X3’s big, sweeping digital screen dashboard, it does stick with the old separate instrument panel and touchscreen, both 12.3 inches across. The big screen in the middle uses older iDrive software that’s still good to use, and it’s easier to control on the move than a touchscreen-only system thanks to the click-wheel controller down on the console. Up front, there’s plenty of space even if you’re tall, and the adjustable steering wheel and excellent sports seats mean that the driving position is both very good and very comfortable. In the back seats, legroom is fine but that sloping roofline means that tall rear seat passengers will find that their heads are brushing the ceiling, and it’s a bit dark and gloomy back there. The boot is actually pretty good — it holds just 45 litres less than the roomy new X3, at least when you measure up to the luggage cover — and the floor is flat, with no loading lip so it’s easy to heft heavy items up and into the boot. The rear seats fold flat, and they split 40:20:40 for maximum practicality, but you do lose a good bit of seats-down space compared to the X3 — a full 200 litres. The standard X4’s engine choice is limited to just two diesels now. If you go for a sporty M model, there’s a bit more choice, with a more powerful straight-six petrol and straight-six diesel, and even a full-on 510hp X4 M if you really want to go nuts. All models come with BMW’s xDrive four-wheel drive as standard, and all come with an eight-speed automatic gearbox. The X4 is actually quite frugal, at least in 2.0-litre xDrive20d diesel form. Thanks to that four-wheel drive system being able to disconnect the front wheels to save fuel, 49mpg is theoretically possible, with low-40s being a realistic goal. It’s still quick, hitting 62mph in 7.9 seconds, which is fine unless you truly crave the 3.8 seconds of the X4 M… For a big 4x4, the X4 is decent to drive, and keeps its composure when traversing a bumpy, twisty British B-road. The xDrive four-wheel drive sends a bit more power to the rear wheels than the fronts, allowing for a more enjoyable driving setup, but the steering isn’t as talkative as it ought to be, and so a Porsche Macan (the petrol one, not the electric one) makes a more engaging car on a challenging road. The X4 can be had with optional adaptive suspension, and this is a must. Not only does it sharpen up the handling for twisty roads, in Comfort mode it also makes the X4 noticeably more comfortable over bumps. Without the adaptive springs, it’s just not as comfy as a Mercedes GLC Coupe. The new BMW X3 is far more technologically advanced than this X4, and comes with the option of a plug-in hybrid engine, but if style is what matters, then the X4 is still worth considering. If you’re interested, check out the latest BMW X4 deals on Carwow, or browse used X4 models from our network of trusted dealers. You can also check out other used BMWs , and when the time comes to sell your current car , Carwow can help with that, too."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/peugeot/e-208,Peugeot e-208 Review & Prices,"£30,050",8/10,"The Peugeot E-208 has had a facelift, updating the all-electric hatchback with a fresh look, a bigger battery and a more powerful electric motor. This makes it a much more competitive small EV, and much easier to consider against great electric cars such as the Mini Cooper Electric , the MG4 and the Cupra Born . An immediate plus point the E-208 has going for it is its size. It’s the same size as the regular petrol 208 , so it’s quite a bit smaller than most EVs. If you want something nippy and compact, perfect for city driving, the E-208 is your best bet this side of a Fiat 500 Electric . Peugeot E-208: electric range, battery and charging data Range: 217 - 245 miles Efficiency: 4.3 - 4.5 mi/kWh Battery size: 50 - 54kWh Max charge speed: 100kW Charge time AC: 0 - 100% 7hr 45m Charge time DC: 20 - 80% 25m Charge port location: Rear left Power outputs: 136 - 156hp It’s also quite sensible and pragmatic, despite its posh outward appearance and high-tech cabin. In that regard it’s a bit like putting a fancy phone case on your work phone - yes, it looks good, but it’s all business where it counts. For 2024 Peugeot upgraded the E-208’s exterior looks. But part of the appeal is that there’s very little to mark it out as an electric car - if you didn’t spot the green flash on the number plate or the discreet ‘E’ badging, you’d think it was just a regular petrol 208. It does look smart, though, with distinctive ‘triple-claw’ LED daytime running lights front and rear, smart diamond-cut alloy wheels and even a homage to the old Peugeot 205 in the shape of its rear window. That compact silhouette hides an interior that is a bit tighter than the class best. The rear seats are quite cramped, and even the front seats aren’t the best for very tall drivers. The boot, though quite roomy at 311 litres, can’t compete with larger cars of a similar price, such as the 363-litre MG4 EV and the 385-litre Cupra Born. The E-208 is at least much more roomy than the Mini Cooper Electric - and its dashboard has a similar wow factor, too. It’s beautifully built, with lots of squashy, high-quality materials, and the 10.0-inch touchscreen that sits on the top is clear, responsive and quite easy to use. Other nice touches include the row of piano-style keys underneath the screen, while Peugeot’s i-Cockpit dial layout is present and correct - though it still won’t suit everybody’s driving position. You get a choice of two battery and motor combos. The entry-level is the same one the E-208 was offered with at launch in 2019 - a 50kWh battery and 136hp electric motor. The newer variant of this has 54kWh and 156hp to play with - not a big boost, but huge improvements in efficiency mean this is by far the best option to select. To drive, the E-208 isn’t as rapid as an MG4 or a Cupra Born, and as a result it doesn’t feel too dissimilar to the regular petrol automatic 208. It’s great to drive in town thanks to compact dimensions and quick steering, though the aforementioned MG and Cupra are more entertaining to drive on a twisty road mainly thanks to their rear-wheel drive chassis. But if you want a good-looking small electric car with a standout interior, check out our best Peugeot E-208 deals here. You can browse great deals on other Peugeot models here, or find a used Peugeot for sale here.

https://www.carwow.co.uk/peugeot/508-sw,Peugeot 508 SW Review & Prices,"£48,120",8/10,"The Peugeot 508 SW proves that spacious estate cars don’t have to be boring. Compared with the chinos-and-shirt looks of the Volkswagen Passat Estate and Skoda Superb Estate , the 508 SW is as stylish as a Parisian model in a Givenchy suit smoking a Gauloises outside a Rive Gauche cafe. Unlike many estate cars, the Peugeot 508 SW doesn’t play second fiddle in the looks department to its four-door sibling. Sure, its upright back end isn’t quite as slinky as the standard 508 ’s sloping roof, but it comes with some unique Peugeot lettering on the boot lid, a subtle roof spoiler and some lovely frameless doors which are sure to attract attention from nosey neighbours. An update in 2023 means it's better looking than ever. There are new slim headlights with three vertical claw-like daytime running lights and a cool front grille that blends into the bodywork. And if prying eyes get close enough to examine the Peugeot 508 SW’s interior, they’ll be just as impressed. The simple, minimalist dashboard, high-mounted digital driver’s display and gorgeous piano-key-style switches look more like they belong on an uber-luxurious limousine than a practical family car . The infotainment system isn’t as easy to use as you’d hope, however, but at least it comes with sat nav and smartphone mirroring so you can use your phone’s navigation and music-streaming apps instead of Peugeot’s own programs. Sadly, no amount of fancy phone integration can make up for the cheap, scratchy plastics you’ll find lower down on the Peugeot 508 SW’s doors and centre console. These aren’t dealbreakers, but you’ll notice them each time you reach down to put something in the door bins or adjust your seat. On the subject of seats, you won’t have much trouble finding a comfortable driving position – even if you’re very tall. Just as in the standard 508, the 508 SW comes with Peugeot’s iCockpit system – essentially a small steering wheel and a raised digital driver’s display – that takes a bit of getting used to, but it feels more intuitive in the 508 SW than in most other Peugeots. You might have to adjust your driving position so the wheel doesn't block the dials, though. Unfortunately, while space in the front seats is good, tall adults may find the Peugeot 508 SW’s back seats a little cramped. There’s enough knee room for two six-footers to sit behind equally tall people in the front, but there’s very little shoulder room if you need to carry three in the back at once. It isn’t particularly easy to fit a child seat either, but at least there’s space in the Peugeot 508 SW’s boot for a family’s luggage for a week away or – if you fold the back seats down – a bike with its wheels attached. A Skoda Superb Estate’s boot is bigger though. For low fuel bills over long distances, pre-2023 cars had a frugal (if rather noisy) diesel engine. However, now you only have the choice of petrol or plug-in hybrid . If you spend most of your time on the motorway the petrol should offer lower running costs However, city dwellers will prefer the hybrid. It costs a fair bit more to buy than the petrol, but you could make that back over time thanks to its low low fuel bills, provided you’ve somewhere to charge it up. With a full battery, the 508 can go about 30 miles on electric power. There’s also a super-quick sporty version of the hybrid called 508 PSE (Peugeot Sport Engineered), which has 360hp but at a cost that will convince you there’s a typo in the price list. On the motorway, you’ll find the Peugeot 508 SW cruises along quietly and comfortably at speed. You'll have to get the pricey PSE for adaptive suspension as standard, which helps iron out bumps in Comfort mode and makes the 508 SW feel more fun to drive in its Sport setting. It's also available as an optional extra on top-spec GT versions. However, even then, it doesn’t quite turn the 508 SW into a sharp, nimble sports estate, and the fake engine noises that get piped through the car’s speakers do little to improve the illusion. Don’t let this put you off, though – especially if you prefer your estate cars relaxing rather than sporty. To that end, the Peugeot 508 SW also comes with a smooth eight-speed automatic gearbox as standard in all models and plenty of active safety kit to help prevent avoidable accidents. This all helps make the Peugeot 508 SW a practical family estate that’s very easy to live with and pretty stress-free to drive. It isn’t as much fun as some sportier alternatives, but when it comes to style, it’s streets ahead of the current crop of drab-looking estates. So if you fancy yourself a chic estate, check out the latest Peugeot 508 SW deals to see how much you could save through carwow. You can also browse used Peugeot 508 SW models as well as an extensive stock of other used Peugeots . And if you want to sell your car online , carwow can help with that too."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/peugeot/e-3008,Peugeot E-3008 Review & Prices,"£45,960",7/10,"The Peugeot E-3008 is one of the most distinctive-looking cars on the market today. While the latest generation has sacrificed some practicality for the sake of its swoopy looks, it’s a very accomplished family car under the skin. It’s like a pair of Ray-Ban sunglasses; still does the same job as a pair of petrol station specials, but it’s a bit posher and more interesting to look at. And again, as with a pair of designer sunglasses, there are other stylish alternatives to consider; the hybrid Renault Rafale , minimalist Tesla Model Y , retro-futuristic Hyundai Ioniq 5 and swoopy Volkswagen ID.5 to name a few. Though only the Ioniq 5 comes close to having as much road presence as the E-3008. It’s a fascinating mix of crisp angles, intricate details and big, bold surfaces. The roofline is oh-so rakish, and there’s even a little flick-up spoiler on the boot edge; Peugeot’s done a bang-up job with the styling. Range: 304 - 435 miles Efficiency: 4.2 - 4.5 miles per kWh Battery size: 73kWh, 97kWh Max charge speed: 160kW Charge time AC: 10hr 30mins, 0-100% at 7kW Charge time DC: 30 mins, 20-80% at 160kW Charge port location: Left side rear Power outputs: 210hp, 230hp, 320hp And the interior is just as impressive, looking as though it were designed with a ruler or a set square - in a good way -  and there’s a clever use of fabric to mask harder plastics. The dashboard wraps around the driver, with a crisp 21.0-inch widescreen display housing both the infotainment and instrument cluster. Some thoughtful touches include a touchscreen shortcut bar under the middle air vents, and a secondary haptic climate control shortcut bar below it. While there’s standard Apple CarPlay / Android Auto connectivity, it is frustrating that you need to navigate away from them to adjust the climate settings. There’s plenty of room and adjustability to get comfortable in the front, even with Peugeot’s quirky small steering wheel, and rear passengers won’t feel hard done by for head space - even with the sloping roofline. Rear knee room is tight, but there’s a handy 520-litre boot capacity, though alternatives such as the Model Y and ID.5 have more cargo space. The E-3008 is rather efficient, with a claimed range of up to 435 miles depending on which trim and battery size you go for. You’ll likely see around 80% of that range in the real world, which isn’t bad going, but there is a hybrid 3008 available if you prefer petrol power. On the road, the E-3008 doesn’t quite match the precedent set by its sporty styling. It has tight, darty steering and a responsive throttle in sport mode, but it doesn’t feel all that comfortable being hustled down a country lane. It can feel unsettled with quick direction changes, and there’s almost zero feel from the brake pedal which is disconcerting. The dual-motor 325hp version feels more sure footed thanks to its four-wheel drive system, and it is quick, but it’s not quite the high-performance drive that Peugeot suggests it is. All versions are hugely comfortable though, soaking up bad roads with ease around town and sitting at a whisper-quiet cruise on the motorway - though the sharp steering can be a little jarring when making lane changes at high speeds. Still, the E-3008 is fantastic as a comfortable, stylish cruiser, and you can have a look at new E-3008 deals through Carwow. There are also E-3008 lease deals , and used Peugeot E-3008 deals through our trusted network of dealers. If you’re open to different body styles, there are other used Peugeots available, and Carwow can even help you sell your old car when you decide to make the jump."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/peugeot/208,Peugeot 208 Review & Prices,"£19,995",8/10,"Think of the Peugeot 208 as the chocolate truffle of the small hatchback market, where the alternatives are an assortment of tarts and pastries. It’s a bit smaller than you might want at times, but ultimately it feels that little bit more special and luxurious. That doesn’t mean it’s the obvious choice though, because the Renault Clio runs the 208 close for style points, the Audi A1 might just have the Peugeot edged out on badge appeal and the Skoda Fabia brings a heavy dose of practicality to the table. Yet for its numerous alternatives, the 208 certainly stands out on the road. Though the latest model was launched back in 2019, the 208 looks bang up to date after a 2024 refresh. Lion claw-themed running lights and an intricate grille tie the car’s front end in with a similar motif for the LED taillights. A retro side-window shape inspired by the iconic 205, chunky gloss-black wheel arches and a selection of intricate wheel designs all add some flair to the chic, sporty looking hatchback. Peugeot has done just as good a job with the 208’s interior, which looks and feels as though it’s been taken out of a much more expensive car. The dashboard is intricate without feeling fussy, wrapping around the driver and passenger while clearly displaying the standard-fit 10.0-inch touchscreen infotainment display. GT-spec models get an uber-cool 3D-effect driver’s screen, though lesser trims still get a digital display, and all models have soft-touch materials in abundance. There is the odd scratchy plastic on the door cards and lower dashboard, but other aspects such as the lovely, clicky dashboard button are nice to the touch. The 208 is fitted with Peugeot’s i-Cockpit dashboard layout, where the steering wheel is small and mounted low down. Long-legged drivers may find it odd to get used to, but the small wheel adds to the car’s agile feeling around corners. Sadly, it’s not very spacious inside; squeezing four adults into the 208 makes for a rather cosy environment, and fitting one six-footer behind another is best saved for emergencies. The boot is smaller than in the Renault Clio and Volkswagen Polo at 311 litres, and you’ve got a high load lip to contend with when loading heavy items too. Entry-level 208 Style models are powered by a 1.2-litre petrol engine with a manual gearbox , but Allure, GT and GT Premium cars have an automatic , hybrid unit instead. They’re all fuel efficient and smooth, but the hybrid options are far punchier and add some extra sportiness to the 208’s driving experience. The additional power makes the hybrid 208 easier to dart around town in, and it’s more relaxing to drive with its automatic gearbox - though it can be a bit lethargic when changing gear. It’s an easy car to pile motorway miles on too, with only a little wind noise to contend with. Country roads are quite fun, and the hybrid models have plenty of punch to accelerate between corners, though the Renault Clio has it pipped when it comes to sporty driving. Still, the 208 can put a smile on your face when hustling along on a bendy road. As far as small hatchbacks go, the Peugeot 208 may not be the most practical option, but it’s got enough charisma and style about it to tempt you away from cars with posher badges on the back.

https://www.carwow.co.uk/peugeot/e-rifter,Peugeot e-Rifter Review & Prices,"£32,250",5/10,"If you’re in the market for a family MPV with an all-electric powertrain and loads of interior space, the Peugeot e-Rifter may be the car you’re after. While it might not be the most enticing-looking thing, it has all the attributes for those who need to lug things or people around regularly. As long as it’s within a reasonably short distance. The e-Rifter is a bit like a lightweight Cesna aircraft. Sure it’s great at shorter distances and very good at that. But you’ll be making plenty of stops if you want to go on any long-distance trips. It shares underpinnings with the Citroen e-Berlingo and Vauxhall Combo Life Electric , so if it looks familiar that could be why. Unlike the VW ID Buzz , which is a style icon, the e-Rifter ranks among the more reserved offerings. It’s slab-sided and won’t be winning any design awards, but has a smart face that will be pleasing to some. The cabin also isn’t the most exciting, but it has got either blue or orange sections to brighten up the otherwise black and grey finish. You get Peugeot’s funky iCockpit setup, while there are loads of storage bins and cubbies to hold your things, which makes for a very practical cabin. Rear space is also pretty good, while the boot is well-sized, although you’ll have to contend with a large tailgate, so make sure you don’t park too close to anything at the back. It’s not the nicest-feeling cabin though, as durability is the keyword with the e-Rifter. Scratchy plastics cover a lot of the surfaces, while the compact steering wheel is only leather-covered in the GT version. As with the cabin, the drive system is pretty underwhelming. You get a 50kWh battery pack paired to a front-mounted electric motor – and that’s on both the standard or long-wheelbase version. But on both, the official range of 172 miles isn’t likely to be enough for most families – especially if longer journeys are likely to be part of the mix. On such lengthier runs, efficiency isn’t great. Being boxy in shape, the e-Rifter doesn’t cut through the air very well, so you get a lot of wind noise. You also run through your battery quickly, and we found you’re more likely to go not much further than 100 miles on motorway drives. The e-Rifter is better suited to life off the motorway. With its lighter steering and large windows all-around, you have good credentials for town family runaround. The electric motor gets you up to speed quickly enough, while the option of regenerative braking to recoup charge helps negotiate slower moving traffic – although the car won’t come to a stop on its own due to the lack of a one-pedal drive mode. Vans aren’t great to drive on twistier roads, and the e-Rifter conforms to that stereotype. It feels cumbersome as the electric motor is only just powerful enough, but it doesn’t lean too much in bends as the batteries are mounted in the floor to help with stability. While it may have some major drawbacks, the Peugeot e-Rifter is better suited to people needing a large car for around town and who don’t need to venture too far from home with it. It also isn’t too pricey, especially against the Volkswagen ID. Buzz . Plus it has the option of seven seats – a rare asset among smaller EVs. And if you want to get a great deal on the e-Rifter , check out carwow, where you can also browse offers on the latest Peugeot models as well. If you want to see what used Peugeots are around, carwow has that too, and if you’re looking to change your car, our sell my car service will help you get a great price."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/peugeot/408,Peugeot 408 Review & Prices,"£34,735",8/10,"The Peugeot 408 is the car you buy when you just can’t decide between a sleek saloon and a chunky SUV , as it’s basically the half-way point between the two. It has some of the ground clearance and plastic cladding of an SUV, but the low roofline and sleek shape of a saloon, and it kind of looks like an elephant has sat on a Lamborghini Urus . All of this means that it’s a bit tricky to work out where the 408 fits among alternatives you might be considering. The Honda Civic is around the same price, but the Peugeot is roomier. The Skoda Octavia is much more practical, but also much more conventional. Perhaps the semi-SUV likes of the Cupra Formentor and Renault Rafale make for a better comparison, as does the Citroen C5 X , which shares a chassis and engines with the 408, and which is similarly tricky to pigeon-hole. It’s almost daring in its style, but not all of what’s on show works. We like the pert rear end with the built-in spoiler, and the expressive headlights, but some of the chunky SUV-bits lower down on the body look quite awkward. Equally, if you go for the basic 17-inch alloy wheels, the 408 can look as if it’s been fitted with the wheels from a supermarket trolley — go for the optional 19-inch rims, or even the 20-inch wheels. The front end is pretty striking, with the body-coloured grille and the slashing LED running lights, but even so it’s hard to see the 408 as a coherent whole — it’s like lots of different cars all mixed into one, and they’re all fighting for supremacy. The cabin is a much quieter affair, and it shares a lot with the likes of the Peugeot 308 hatchback. The 408 does seem to have had a boost in quality though, and with the sweeping layout and the high-quality materials, you’d not be disappointed if you hopped out of a Volkswagen , or even an Audi , and straight into a 408. The infotainment system is good, too, thanks to a layout that’s easy enough to find your way around. There’s a handy set of digital buttons, which are shortcuts to the functions you need, and you can customise the layout of those shortcuts to your taste. There’s also wireless connections for Android Auto and Apple CarPlay , but it’s still annoying that you have to go into a separate on-screen menu for the climate control. Bring back buttons, please. The front seats are really good, but you should definitely take a test drive before buying as not everyone can get their driving position to match up with Peugeot’s small steering wheel and high-set instruments. The wheel is supposed to sit low down, while you look at the instruments over the top, but you might find that the wheel gets in the way of some of the dials. Space up front is decent, with storage areas under the armrest and door bins that are lined to avoid rattles. There are two big cup holders, and space in the back is surprisingly good, even with that low roof. It’s a little narrow, though, so the 408 is really a four-seater, as the middle rear seat is close to useless. You can choose from two plug-in hybrid versions, which should appeal to company car buyers with their low official CO2 ratings, but the company car tax system is changing this year, so business buyers might be better off waiting for the all-electric E-408 to arrive, with its 280-mile range. There’s also a basic 1.2-litre petrol hybrid version, which isn’t as powerful but feels sweeter to drive than the PHEV versions simply because it’s lighter. Given the 408’s ride height, you’d expect it to have a softly-softly SUV-style way over bumps, but it’s actually surprisingly stiff. It’s fine around town, but there’s a good bit of noise from both the suspension and the tyres on bigger roads, which makes the 408 less comfortable when cruising. The standard hybrid is slightly better off in this respect than the plug-in versions, which again is mostly down to its weight.

https://www.carwow.co.uk/peugeot/108,Peugeot 108 Review & Prices,"£4,280",6/10,"The Peugeot 108 is undeniably one of the old ’uns in the city car segment, alongside its fellow old-stagers the Citroen C1 and Toyota Aygo , which are basically the same car underneath. So does the three-of-a-kind 108 represent a safe bet, or is it a gamble too far these days? Well, so far, only the Hyundai i10 – with its spacious interior and generous equipment levels – has had the measure of the Volkswagen Up / Seat Mii / Skoda Citigo (now dead) trio. Still, from the off, the Peugeot has all the important boxes ticked: it’s cheap to buy, frugal to run, has small dimensions and cheeky looks. It also has equipment such as a touchscreen infotainment system, air-conditioning, plus automatic headlights and wipers. The old Peugeot 108 was always an excellent city car. Its willing little three-cylinder engine, in town at least, gave nippy performance and emitted a pleasant thrum that meant working it hard wasn’t a chore on the ears. The same wasn’t true at motorway speeds, where the engine noise soon manifested itself as a constant and annoying drone. Peugeot has looked to address this in the new model and it’s something VW managed with the Up. Last but not least is the option to fit a fold-back fabric roof that is electrically operated and gives something of a convertible feel. It was an option fitted to the 108 Top Allure. The new Peugeot 108 is a vast improvement over the car it replaces thanks to boosted safety and even lower running costs. It is also better equipped and enjoyable to own, especially if you choose to spec the full-length folding fabric roof that effectively transforms the car into a cut-price convertible. All good news then, but elephants in the room come in the form of the Hyundai i10 and the Volkswagen Up – the duo are more fun to drive, have added solidity and are more practical – three advantages that are hard to ignore in this class.

https://www.carwow.co.uk/peugeot/traveller,Peugeot Traveller Review & Prices,"£17,599",5/10,"The Peugeot Traveller is a large van-based MPV with up to nine seats, but running costs comparable to a regular car. It’s an alternative to the Mercedes V-Class and Hyundai i800 . As soon as you see the Traveller, it’s obvious that it has its roots in a van, but that’s not a problem. On the contrary, it has the distinct benefit of allowing buyers to choose from a variety of arrangements. That means that not only can you pick from different seating arrangements – covering both the number of seats and how they’re laid out – you can also choose between two different lengths of vehicle. As you can probably guess, the Traveller’s large, boxy exterior means that it has a massive amount of space inside for passengers – far more than in a conventional MPV . And, if you remove all the rear seats – which is not easy, as they’re pretty heavy – you can have a colossal luggage capacity of as much as 4,500 litres to play with. Again, it’ll come as no surprise that there’s a van-like air to the materials, but the design and equipment are reminiscent of what you’ll find in a Peugeot car. So, among the toys that are available are DAB radio, smartphone connectivity through Apple CarPlay and Android Auto , dual-zone climate control and a 7.0-inch touchscreen. You can even get a head-up display that projects info – such as current speed – onto the windscreen, as well as a reversing camera. Overall, if you’re upgrading from a family hatchback , you’ll find the standard equipment is decent, but not particularly generous for the price. You get cruise control, parking sensors and air-conditioning, while radar-guided cruise control, automatic city braking and an 180-degree camera are notable options. Despite the tall body and the high seating position, driving the Traveller is fairly easy. It’s surprisingly manoeuvrable and the soft suspension means that you won’t feel too many bumps. Ultimately, though, you can never forget that you’re driving something that’s basically a van. On the motorway, the Peugeot’s brick-like aerodynamics mean it suffers from more wind noise than conventional, car-based rivals such as the Ford Galaxy . And, when you turn into a corner, there’s a lot of body roll. Just as unsurprisingly, the only engines available are diesels, but what will probably come as a surprise is that the smallest unit is just a 1.5-litre unit. Naturally, it doesn’t get the Traveller moving all the quickly, but it has the advantage of the lowest CO2 emissions and the best fuel economy in the range. If you’re likely to be using the Traveller more heavily laden, then it’s worth considering one of the stronger engines, both of which are 2.0-litre units. They give progressively stronger performance, but the price you pay are increasingly high fuel consumption and emissions. If you have a particularly large family or regularly have to move lots of people, then the Traveller could be the right car for you. But, the likelihood is that most people will find a more conventional MPV or SUV suits them better and will cost them a fair bit less to buy and run.

https://www.carwow.co.uk/peugeot/108-top,Peugeot 108 TOP Convertible Review and Prices,"£11,115",6/10,"The Peugeot 108 TOP is a soft-top version of the compact 108 city car that comes with a partial fabric roof. Just like the hard-top 108, it shares many components with the Citroen C1 and Toyota Aygo, but – in addition to a folding roof – it comes with front and rear doors as standard. Besides its folding fabric roof, the Peugeot 108 TOP interior looks identical to the standard 108. You get an equally minimalist cabin with only the bare minimum of buttons for the heating and ventilation and top-spec cars get equally eye-catching striped seats. Unlike the standard 108, the Peugeot 108 TOP comes with a seven-inch touchscreen with smartphone mirroring as standard. Also fitted across the range is a height-adjustable drivers’ seat to help you find your ideal seating position. There’s enough head and legroom for you to get comfortable if you’re over six-feet tall, too, but rear-seat passenger space is far from impressive. Sure, you get front and rear doors as standard, but there’s less head and legroom in the two back seats than you get in the likes of the VW Up and the Skoda Citigo. Having a folding roof doesn’t affect the Peugeot 108 TOP’s practicality, but it still can’t carry a great deal in the boot. There’s space for a pair of small suitcases, but that’s pretty much it. You can fold the two back seats down to carry more, but a bike won’t fit unless you remove its wheels. Chances are, though, you won’t be considering a compact convertible because you want to carry lots of luggage. You’ll be more interested in cruising along with the top down. Unfortunately, while the Peugeot 108 TOP is a doddle to drive, it isn’t particularly comfortable. It’s noisier than the standard car at speed, too, and its 1.0-litre petrol engine is sedate to say the least. The Peugeot 108 TOP isn’t what some would call a ‘true’ convertible, but its folding fabric roof still lets you enjoy the wind in your hair Accelerating from 0-62mph takes more than 13 seconds, and versions fitted with the optional automatic gearbox take even longer. That said, at least it’s cheap to run. With a gentle touch on the accelerator, you should be able to manage more than 50mpg in normal driving conditions. The Peugeot 108 TOP is very easy to manoeuvre around town. You don’t get parking sensors or a reversing camera as standard but the Peugeot 108 TOP’s small size and light steering mean it’s dead easy to park and the relatively large windows make it easy to spot your way through tight gaps in traffic. Unfortunately, some key safety kit that helps prevent avoidable accidents – such as automatic emergency braking – costs extra across the Peugeot 108 TOP range. But, if you’re looking for an affordable soft top that’s cheap to buy and cheap to run, it’s certainly worth a closer look."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/peugeot/e-308,Peugeot e-308 Review & Prices,"£37,860",7/10,"Think of the new Peugeot e-308 as the concluding part of a trilogy: you can already buy a conventionally powered 308 and a plug-in hybrid, but now there’s a fully electric car to complete the set. The electric version is the most expensive of the three, which is to be expected as an electric car, but it’s also more expensive than most of the other battery-powered hatchbacks you might consider, such as the Volkswagen ID3 , Citroen e-C4 and Renault Megane E-Tech . And that’s for the five-door hatchback; there’s also an e-308 SW , which is something of a rarity as there aren’t many electric estate cars. What do you get for your money? Well, aside from the usual 308 good stuff – stylish looks and an upmarket cabin – the entry-level Allure model comes with 18-inch alloy wheels, heated front seats and steering wheel, and satellite navigation is standard along with a rear-view camera. Safety kit includes autonomous emergency braking and adaptive cruise control to hold a safe distance from the vehicle in front. GT models are about £2,000 more, adding full matrix LED headlights, 3D LED taillights, a GT-specific grille, and wider sills to add more aggression to the looks. The seats are trimmed with soft Alcantara , there’s aluminium trim on the dash and door panels, and you get front parking sensors. The 3D digital instrument cluster is a neat touch that adds cool factor to the cabin. For a short period, there’s also a limited-run First Edition. This costs a fraction less than the GT and has an exclusive interior with upholstery that combines cloth, synthetic leather and Alcantara. All three trim levels share the same electric motor and battery. The motor has 156hp, which should be enough for brisk rather than exciting performance – you won’t be keeping up with a Tesla Model 3 , that’s for sure. The 54kWh battery offers an official range of up to 250 miles, though the higher-spec car manages a couple of miles less due to its larger alloy wheels. That’s a little behind the Volkswagen ID3 Pro’s 266-mile range, despite the fact the Peugeot comes with a heat pump as standard to improve efficiency. Using that 250 miles of range is a generally pleasant experience. The e-308 manages to be comfortable around town, yet still has a bit of fun about it when the road goes twisty. But only up to a point. For an electric car, it's not very punchy at all, with only 156hp on offer where 200hp is more of a base level for electric hatchbacks these days. It's fine, just feels a bit sluggish if you've ever driven any of those VW, Cupra, MG or Renault alternatives that pack a bit more power and therefore a more impressive acceleration. When you do need to stop and recharge, the e-308 is capable of topping up its batteries from 20-80% in about 30 minutes using a 100kW rapid charger. A full charge from a 7.4kW home wallbox takes seven hours and 20 minutes. So, is the Peugeot e-308 a good car? Well, the regular Peugeot 308 earned score of 8/10 on Carwow, so it’s off to a strong start, but there’s no getting away from the fact it costs more than the talented alternatives listed above, and can’t go quite as far as the best electric hatchbacks on a full charge. But the interior quality is a step above the likes of the VW ID3, Vauxhall Astra Electric or MG 4, and it’s an all-round high-quality experience.  Check out the latest Peugeot e-308 deals available through Carwow, or browse other new Peugeot deals , and you can also see the latest used Peugeot stock from a network of trusted dealers.

https://www.carwow.co.uk/peugeot/308-sw,Peugeot 308 SW Review & Prices,"£31,865",8/10,"If you like the look of the Peugeot 308 but need a bit more space, the 308 SW estate could be the right car for you. With the larger boot space and a higher roof line, it’s considerably more practical than the hatchback and goes up against the likes of the Vauxhall Astra Sports Tourer , Volkswagen Golf Estate and Skoda Octavia Estate . It’s a lot like one of the big blue Ikea bags – it’s large, practical and it stands out from the crowd. The Peugeot’s a bit more fashionable, though. The exterior design incorporates a rather large grille with the new Peugeot shield at the centre and the headlights blended into the edges. The car also has fang-like daytime running lights that add extra detail to the front, while you get sharp lines and cool alloy wheel designs down the side. The SW’s rear lights have a 3D effect to them, while you also get more creases and thick cladding on the bumper. Inside, you’ll find Peugeot’s iCockpit concept. You get two 10.0-inch displays – one for the instruments and the other for the touchscreen infotainment – as well as comfort seats, sport pedals, gloss black trim, a small steering wheel and interesting materials on the dashboard. Room in the rear seats isn’t the best though. Unlike the spacious feeling you get up front, the rear seats are a bit cramped for adults, with head and knee room a little tight. The 308 SW also doesn’t have the widest door openings to fit child seats, and you then have to poke around in the seat base to attach the seat to the Isofix anchor points. Conversely, boot space is pretty good. You get 608 litres in the standard SW, while the plug-in hybrid alternative’s area drops to 548 litres. That’s bigger than its chassis mate, the Vauxhall Astra Sports Tourer , and just pips the Volkswagen Golf Estate . It does lose out to the Skoda Octavia though. You can choose from a petrol, diesel or two plug-in hybrids – all of which are paired to an eight-speed automatic transmission. Both PHEVs can offer 40 miles of electric range, which can be held so you can use it when you need it. In town, the 308 SW feels a little juddery when going over bumps and the engine feels a little out of breath when you initially get going. But you get decent visibility all-round and the steering is quite light to make manoeuvring simple. On a long motorway cruise, the 308 SW comes into its own. The lack of comfort in town is swapped for a smooth ride at higher speeds, while all the engines will get you up to speed easily enough. While the lighter steering works well in town, it feels quite remote when you go on a twisty road. Sure that’s not what the 308 SW is made for, but it feels a little out of its comfort zone. The suspension soaks up the bumps okay, but you can expect some body roll. With a near class-leading boot and stylish looks, the Peugeot 308 SW is a decent estate car in many respects – but its interior space might not suit you. If you want the latest deals on the Peugeot 308 SW or other new Peugeot models , go through carwow, where you can also get used deals on Peugeots . To change your car completely, you can sell your car through carwow, where our dealers will bid on your car to get you the best price."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/peugeot/e-308-sw,Peugeot e-308 SW Review & Prices,"£39,060",7/10,"The Peugeot e-308 SW is one of those rare things - a fully electric estate car. Together with the mechanically identical Vauxhall Astra Sports Tourer Electric , it joins the bargain-basement MG5 EV and the Porsche Taycan Sport Turismo as the only such models on sale in the UK. Most car companies have so far preferred to sink their investment into electric SUVs , but an electric estate car has many benefits - it’s still very practical for a family, but being lower to the ground and lighter is more efficient than a tall, heavy SUV, and can therefore eke out that extra bit of range from the battery pack. A bit like Betamax, it’s a good idea that has a bit of an uphill struggle to compete with the flavour of the month - though unlike Betamax, it doesn’t look like the e-308 SW will be a total failure. In fact, it’s quite a likeable car, especially when you get inside. Like all current Peugeots, the e-308 SW has an interior that feels stylish, upmarket and packed with technology. A 10.0-inch touchscreen and digital instrument panel make it feel suitably up-to-date, but it’s the little features that make it feel premium - the posh-feeling toggle switches under the central screen, for example, or the big swathe of fabric running across the dashboard and the tops of the doors. Some drivers might not get on with Peugeot’s i-Cockpit setup, which places the instrument cluster high up above a shrunken steering wheel - which you look over, rather than through. You might find you need to lower the wheel more than you’re comfortable with to see the dials properly, so it could be worth taking a test drive to make sure you can get on with it. Range: 248 miles Efficiency: 4.1 miles per kWh Battery size: 51kWh Max charge speed: 100kW Charge time AC: 7hrs 30 mins, 0-100%, 7kW Charge time DC: 30 mins, 0-80%, 100kW Charge port location: Left rear Power output: 156hp Regardless of size you should have no trouble getting on with the e-308 SW’s practicality. Its 548-litre boot is huge, being long and wide with a completely flat floor when you fold the seats down. It’s ideal for big shops, trips to the flat-pack furniture store or the occasional tip run, and should be able to accommodate even a big pushchair with ease. Rear legroom isn’t quite as generous, but it’s sufficient for a six-foot adult - and the equal of any of the compact electric SUVs you might be considering as an alternative, like a Kia Niro EV or Volkswagen ID3 . Peugeot is keen that its electric cars should feel no different to its petrol or diesel ones, so the e-308 SW is made to be as similar to the regular 308 as possible. To that end, you don’t get a particularly whizzy electric motor or bags and bags of power like some alternatives. A fairly modest power output here means excellent efficiency, allowing the e-308’s comparatively small battery to still provide a competitive range of up to 248 miles. That does mean, though, that if you want zippy performance - or a longer range - you’ll need to look elsewhere, as Peugeot only offers the one powertrain. It might also sting that the e-308 SW’s comparatively modest performance comes at an asking price several thousand pounds more than faster and longer-range contemporaries. If the price doesn’t put you off, why not find out more by browsing the best Peugeot e-308 SW deals right here on Carwow. Check out used Peugeot 308s , or other used Peugeots - and remember that when the time comes, you can even sell your car online on Carwow."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/peugeot/rifter,Peugeot Rifter Review & Prices,"£26,425",6/10,"The Peugeot Rifter is a boxy shaped family car that gives you loads of interior space and a huge boot, as you would expect from a car that’s based on a van. But if you’re expecting the Rifter’s interior to have the pizzaz of the Peugeot 3008 SUV’s cabin, you’ll be disappointed because there’s none of that car’s smart design or use of eccentric fabric trims. No, in the Rifter you get loads of hard plastics with the odd flash of colour to stop things looking too miserable. The small steering wheel and instrument binnacle that sits above it are nods to the i-Cockpit style design you get in other Peugeot cars, as is the infotainment system that sprouts out the top of the dashboard in all but entry-level Access models. The touchscreen’s prominent position and decent size make it fairly easy to use even when you’re driving, and the sat-nav’s directions are easy enough to follow. You even get separate ventilation controls so you don’t have to go hunting through menus just to turn up the fan, as you do in a Peugeot 308 . There are more compelling reasons to choose the Peugeot Rifter over a 308, though, and the most obvious is its generous interior space. You get loads of room up front and all models offer adjustment to ensure you get a comfortable driving position, whether you’re tall or small. It’s just a shame the seats themselves aren’t very supportive. A similar accusation could be made of the back seats, which have loads of head and leg room but feel a little too upright to be comfortable for your passengers on long journeys. Mind you, the rear sliding doors give you great access, plus its width and flat floor mean you can carry three adults without anyone feeling short of elbow or foot room. Wait until 2019 and you’ll also be able to choose a seven-seater model, which really does have space for seven tall adults. Whichever model you choose, interior storage is also very impressive. The Peugeot Rifter gets the door bins and cup holders you’d expect of any family car and to those it adds handy features such as a deep cubby between the front seats – big enough for several two-litre bottles of water – train-style overhead storage and a large lidded box on top of the dashboard in addition to the regular glove box. The practical theme continues when you get to the boot – its huge opening, boxy shape and lack of a load lip make it simple to pack and it should easily swallow a family’s luggage for a fortnight away. Head onto the road and you’ll find the Rifter’s boxy shape doesn’t just make it practical, the raised driving position also gives you a decent view out – although the large pillar around the windscreen can hide cyclists when you’re pulling out of junctions. Parking isn’t an issue, though, because mid-range models and above come with reversing sensors as standard. Automatic emergency brakes are also standard and, if you do lots of town driving, it is also worth considering the smooth-shifting optional eight-speed automatic gearbox. It suits the relaxed way you tend to drive the Peugeot Rifter, which suffers from plenty of body roll in bends. Slow steering – despite the tiny wheel – doesn’t exactly encourage spirited driving but, if you feel the need, the Peugeot goes where you point it and has plenty of grip. Surprisingly, it’s actually on the motorway where the Rifter’s van DNA is at its most obvious – at a cruise there’s quite a lot of wind and engine noise, and no models could claim to have an excess of horsepower for fast motorway overtakes. Having said that, the 110hp Blue HDi diesel is quick enough for most people’s needs and should happily return fuel economy of more than 60mpg. The 110 PureTech petrol’s nippier performance makes it a better bet if you’ll mostly drive it in town and it will be more frugal than a petrol SUV of a similar size. In fact, the Rifter’s low price and huge interior mean it’s arguably a better family car than any SUV for the same money, but only if you can live with its boxy looks and stodgy image.

Not only can this practical plug-in hybrid accelerate from 0-62mph in 5.2 seconds, but Peugeot also claims it can travel 34 miles on nothing but electricity. It’s definitely a sight for sore eyes, too, which is a good thing considering it’s set to go up against go-faster versions of the BMW 3 Series and Volvo S60 . The regular 508 is already one of the most handsome cars around – both in saloon and 'SW' estate form – but with its massive 20-inch alloys, aggressive new bodywork and vivid green accents, the updated-for-2023 508 Peugeot Sport Engineered (PSE) looks even more athletic than ever before. Kind of like Brad Pitt would if he was wearing his gym kit. This sporting theme continues on the inside. It’s all dark leather upholstery, soft touch plastics and bright, contrasting stitching in here – and they all combine to pretty stunning effect. The 508 PSE looks and feels like a properly high-end sporting saloon (or estate), and its mid-life update only improved things. A new 10.0-inch infotainment screen with sat nav is now standard across the range. That's a good thing, but the driving position is a bit more of a controversial issue. The seats offer plenty of adjustment and are impressively supportive, but the low-set, small-diameter steering wheel might just feel plain weird to some, and could block the updated digital dials, depending on your driving position. Headroom in the back is pretty tight too, but this go-faster 508 does at least have a large boot. It’ll get you and your luggage down the road very quickly, too. By combining a regular petrol engine with not one, but two electric motors (one at each end for all-wheel-drive), the 508 PSE puts down an impressive 360hp. And when you’re not in the mood to really get your foot down, its 12.4Wh battery will let you travel 34 miles on nothing but electricity. Admittedly, despite adding a few miles with the latest update, that claimed figure is a touch limited next to other sporty plug-in hybrid saloons, which is important if you’re planning on running one as a company car. As it stands, it slots into the 14% benefit-in-kind tax bracket. Don’t let the 508’s sporty looks and performance fool you into thinking that it’s too hardcore for daily use, either. Sure, you’re aware of its more athletic suspension when you’re driving around town or out on the motorway, but it doesn’t crash over bumps and is impressively comfortable over distance. Those large 20-inch alloys to generate a fair bit of road noise, mind. Still, this is a problem that can be easily solved. The Peugeot 508 PSE comes with an excellent Focal premium sound system as standard, along with everything from DAB radio to Bluetooth, and satellite navigation to Apple CarPlay and Android Auto . There’s lots of useful safety tech, too. A 360-degree camera and rear parking sensors will come in handy in town, while things like adaptive cruise control, autonomous emergency braking and lane-keep assist will help to keep things comfortable and safe on the motorway. Of course, a car with this much sporting potential and on-board tech isn’t particularly cheap. Prices start at just under £54,000, which is about what you’d pay for a plug-in hybrid from Volvo , or for a genuine six-cylinder performance car from BMW . But if this handsome French athlete is up your alley, head on over to our Peugeot 508 PSE deals page to see how much money we can save, or browse used 508 PSE models from our network of trusted dealers. You can also have a look at our latest used Peugeot cars for sale , and see how you can sell your car for through carwow."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/peugeot/508,Peugeot 508 Review & Prices,"£46,920",7/10,"If you need a large family car , but don’t want to be go for the boring side of sensible just yet, the Peugeot 508 could be the model for you. If a Volkswagen Passat is a smart shirt-and-chinos combo, the 508 is more of a sharp Givenchy suit, probably worn by a model smoking Gauloise outside a Left Bank cafe. It’s tres cool. And an update in 2023 means it's even better looking than before. The ultra-slim headlights blend into daytime running lights that look like they've been etched by a claw strike from a big lion. The grille blends into the bodywork, which is a unique look, while the rear LED lights have a new design with three angled lines. But while its stylish five-door hatchback/saloon/coupe body looks great – and there's a more practical yet still very fancy-looking 508 SW estate version, too – the back seats are noticeably more cramped than in alternatives such as the Skoda Superb or Volkswagen Passat. It's an appealing option in a dwindling selection of saloon-style models, though; former options such as the Ford Mondeo and Vauxhall Insignia have been dropped due to falling sales. Okay, so you might have to put up with a few complaints from tall passengers in the back, but you certainly can’t accuse the Peugeot 508’s interior of being boring. Its dashboard design is far more interesting than most alternatives and all models come with two large infotainment screens that make the cabin look bang-up-to-date. If you’re more interested in old-fashioned, solid build quality, however, the Peugeot 508 might not be the car for you. It’s certainly not terrible, but the Peugeot’s materials don’t feel as consistently brilliant as those in a Skoda Superb. But driving the Peugeot 508 feels much sportier than pottering about in the Skoda thanks to the 508’s low-set driving position. Not everyone will be a fan of its small steering wheel, though. The boot isn’t the biggest – look to a Superb if that is what matters most to you – but the 508’s large hatchback door makes loading bulky items relatively easy, even if you do have to lift them over a slight boot lip. So, the Peugeot 508’s practicality might not be particularly impressive, but if you’re considering a sporty-looking saloon car , you’ll likely have more than a passing interest in how it drives – and you won’t be too disappointed. The Peugeot 508 is fun to drive down a twisty road, but also manages to smooth out bumps quite effectively too. There's also a sporty Peugeot Sport Engineered (PSE) version if you want more ability in the bends. The 508 isn’t quite so clever when it comes to autonomous driving tech, however. It’s available with active cruise control and lane assist , but these systems aren’t as sophisticated as those you’ll find in a Volvo V60 . The engine lineup is limited now to one petrol and one hybrid , plus a more powerful hybrid system in the sporty PSE. The entry-level engine is a 1.2-litre petrol with 131hp that gets up to 50mpg in official tests. However, for ultimate fuel economy, you can drive around 40 miles on electricity alone with the 225hp plug-in hybrid engine. You'll have to keep the batteries topped up and drive like a saint to achieve its official 274mpg economy figure, though. There will be no saintly driving in the other plug-in version, the 360hp 508 PSE. Think of it as the 508’s answer to the BMW M340i in that it's sportier than the regular model, but it's not supposed to be a hardcore performance car. Other family cars are better built and more spacious, but if that all sounds a bit too ‘pipe and slippers’ for you, then the 508’s stylish design and fun drive make it worthy of a place on your shortlist. Check out how much you could save in the Peugeot 508 deals section. There are also a number of used Peugeot 508s available and you can browse other used Peugeot models from our network of trusted dealers. When it's time to sell your current car , carwow can help with that, too."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/peugeot/e-2008,Peugeot E-2008 Review & Prices,"£34,410",7/10,"If you want a small electric SUV that’s stylish inside and out without sacrificing comfort and practicality, the Peugeot E-2008 is worthy of a spot on your shortlist. The latest model can go a bit further between charges than before too. There are plenty of alternatives at the more affordable end of the electric SUV market, including the MG ZS EV , Volvo EX30 and Vauxhall Mokka Electric , for example. There’s also the Citroen e-C4 and Kia Niro EV , both of which have smart designs – but the E-2008’s chic, upmarket appeal has them all licked. It’s a bit like wearing a Hermès outfit on the catwalk, rather than something from a high street chain. Its fancy styling has some cool details, such as the claw-like running lights in the lower bumper that give it a unique face, while the front grille has upmarket body-coloured inserts on all but the lowest trim. At the back there are LED lights and the Peugeot name is scrawled across the bootlid. Hop inside and you’ll find the style taps are left to flow. A wraparound dashboard is a nice addition, plus there are plenty of high-quality materials used throughout. You’ll have to search hard for anything that feels properly cheap, and there's a big infotainment display that's a bit easier to use than the one in older models, but still not up there with the best. The digital driver’s display is bigger and better than before, too. However, Peugeot’s commitment to having the dials sit above the small wheel means that you’ll find the view of them blocked in some seating positions. Sounds like a minor point, but it’s worth giving it a go before committing to buying an E-2008. Unlike some electric cars which are built from the ground up as battery-powered cars, the E-2008 is based on the petrol-powered 2008. That, unfortunately, results in a hefty hump in the rear seats where you would find mechanical bits in that model, which middle-seat passengers will have to straddle. Those sat in the outer seats will also find kneeroom isn’t great, while taller drivers might find their hair brushes against the bit where the roof meets the door. On the plus side, the boot has no load lip so it’s dead easy to get stuff in and out of, plus its square shape makes it easy to play cargo-loading Tetris. With 435 litres of space to use, it’s fairly good but not massive. The e-C4 and Mokka Electric have less, but the Niro EV can carry more stuff. Spend a bit more and you can have a Skoda Enyaq , which has a massive boot. An update in 2023 increased the E-2008's range from 217 miles to 250 miles, improving the old car's key weakness. That's a useful distance between charges, however, for the cash you can go further in the Kia and a similarly priced MG , while the Citroen and Vauxhall are getting the same battery upgrades as the Peugeot to offer similar range. As well as this single battery option, there’s just one motor option for the E-2008. It’s now 156hp, which is a bit more than before. However, despite having more power it’s very much designed to offer leisurely performance, even if you pop the car into its sportiest settings. Sportiness is not the E-2008’s raison d'etre, though. It can be quite fun to steer down a winding road, but it’s much happier cruising along the motorway or in town, where it soaks up bumps with little fuss. This is a very relaxing and comfortable electric SUV to drive. The Peugeot E-2008 is a real head-turner, and backs this up with a lovely interior, too. Rear seat space is limited and boot capacity is so-so, though the square space does make it more useful. The improved electric range is welcome, too, if still not quite up with the best you can get for this money. Interested?

https://www.carwow.co.uk/peugeot/308-gti,Peugeot 308 GTi Review and Prices,"£32,925",6/10,"The Peugeot 308 GTi is the hot hatch version of the French firm’s small family car. It’s an alternative to the likes of the SEAT Leon Cupra and Volkswagen Golf GTI that comes with a minimalist cabin and a spacious boot, as well as a surprisingly powerful little engine. In keeping with that minimalist theme, from the outside, there’s not much that distinguishes the Peugeot 308 GTi from other 308s. Well, not without hitting the options list, that is. There are a few red trim pieces in the front bumper, as well as lowered suspension and twin exhaust pipes. But, if you want something that stands out a bit more, you can pay extra for the ‘Coupe Franche’ paint job – a two-tone finish that makes the 308 GTi stick out like a sore thumb. Inside, meanwhile, there are plenty of features that set the GTi apart. So, you sit in figure-hugging Alcantara and leather sports seats that hold you firmly in place in tight corners. You also get aluminium pedals, metal kick plates and lots of red stitching. Unfortunately, while the interior looks nice and modern, it doesn’t feel anywhere near as solid or as upmarket as a Golf GTI or Leon Cupra. The infotainment system is also rather disappointing, as it isn’t particularly intuitive to use and the sat-nav can be tricky to follow. On a more positive note, there is lots of room for adults in the front, along with plenty of space to store odds and ends. Sadly, the rear seat isn’t so accommodating, as there’s noticeably less kneeroom than you get in a Golf. It’s a case of so near, yet so far, for the 308 GTi. It’s very close to being a great hot hatch, but it’s not quite on the money When you open the boot, though, you can see what’s happened. It looks like Peugeot has sacrificed some passenger space to allow for a bigger boot, as the 308 GTi’s boot is huge. It has more than enough space to carry a large baby buggy or four suitcases with room to spare. And, with the seats down, there’s significantly more space than you get in most alternatives. Just as impressive is how much power the Peugeot 308 GTi’s relatively small 1.6-litre engine can produce – 262hp – and how much pulling power it delivers at relatively low revs. This means the car responds quickly and feels eager, without the driver having to constantly change gear. It also helps make the Peugeot 308 GTi quicker than the VW Golf GTI. The 308 GTi gets from 0-62mph in just six seconds – that’s almost half a second quicker than the German machine. Given the stats, it’s a shame that the Peugeot’s pokey engine doesn’t sound any more exciting. Admittedly, you can hear its likeable burble and the pops during full-bore gearchanges from the outside, but precious little of that noise makes its way into the cabin. Running costs are impressive, though, with claimed fuel economy of 43.5mpg, although in normal driving conditions, you’ll more likely to see a figure in the mid- to high thirties. That’s on a par with the Golf GTI, but unfortunately the 308 doesn’t feel quite as agile or as sure-footed as the likes of the Golf GTI and Leon Cupra. This issue is somewhat compounded by the 308 GTi’s rather soft suspension, which wallows and bounces around more than a Leon Cupra, Megane RS or Golf GTI on bumpy country roads. The Peugeot 308 GTi was built to beat its namesake from Volkswagen, and in many ways it does. But it can’t match the Golf’s breadth of talents or the way that the Golf feels special even in the mundane cycle of daily life."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/peugeot/308,Peugeot 308 Review & Prices,"£32,925",8/10,"The Peugeot 308 could be right up your street if you want your next family hatchback to really stand out in a sea of restrained-looking alternatives such as the VW Golf and Ford Focus . It's like taking all your practical work clothes and updating them with sparkly accessories. Just take a look at that front end. It looks like Peugeot’s taken the 308 and dipped it face-first in a bucket of leftover Christmas decorations. Shiny daytime chrome, bright running lights and LED lamps are everywhere, along with a brand-new shield-shaped Peugeot badge. Somehow, though, these bits of car jewellery work together to make the 308 look more upmarket than most other small family hatches , such as the Skoda Octavia or SEAT Leon . It’s a similar story at the back, where Peugeot has added some bright red brake-light slashes to the bootlid and a set of shiny chrome exhaust trims to the bumper. Although, peer closer and those square pipes are just plastic add-ons. Thankfully, there’s little of this fakery inside the Peugeot’s cabin. If a surface looks nice (and most of them look terrific) it’ll almost certainly feel equally plush, too. This applies to everything from the soft dashboard trim and the solid centre console, and to the flashy metal-effect trim around the air vents. These vents sit right at the top of the dashboard, beside a high-mounted driver’s display that replaces old-fashioned analogue dials. This looks very similar to the setup you get in the smaller 208 and larger 3008 SUV , and means you peer over the steering wheel to read your speed rather than through it. The steering wheel itself is much smaller than in most cars and sits in your lap rather than at arm’s length. It’s an odd layout that’s tricky to get a good driving position with. Very lofty passengers might also struggle slightly to get comfy in the Peugeot 308’s back seats, but there’s plenty of space for kids to get comfy and the boot can easily swallow a family’s luggage for a weekend away. Speaking of which, the Peugeot 308 is comfortable to drive for long periods, and cruises along happily at motorway speeds. If long drives are a common occurrence, you’ll want to check out the 308’s 1.5-litre diesel engine. It’s not particularly pokey, but is mostly quiet and returns around 50mpg in normal driving conditions without any great effort. If you aren’t planning any particularly long road-trips, you’ll be better off with one of the 308’s petrol or plug-in hybrid engines. There's also an electric version, called e-308 , so you really can have it whichever way you please. The 1.2-litre petrol has more than enough power for town driving and country roads, while the hybrid is nippier and more economical – so long as you have somewhere to charge its battery up regularly. Both versions are easy to drive, quiet and comfortable. All Peugeot 308s are easy to see out of and the dinky steering wheel helps make light work of tight inner-city manoeuvres. Speaking of which, every version comes with rear-parking sensors as standard and you can pay extra for higher-spec cars with adaptive cruise control to help take the sting out of long motorway trips. That said, even entry-level cars come with plenty of equipment as standard, which helps justify their slightly steeper price tag than some less flashy family hatchbacks. If you’re looking for something that’ll stand out but don’t fancy a high-riding SUV , then the new Peugeot 308 is well worth a look. If you’re keen on this stylish family car, you can check out Carwow’s Peugeot 308 deals to see how much you could save. You can also browse the latest used 308s as well as other used Peugeots from our network of trusted dealers. Carwow can help you sell your car , too."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/peugeot/e-5008,Peugeot E-5008 Review & Prices,"£48,660",8/10,"There are very few seven-seater electric SUVs on sale at the moment, and the majority of them are really rather pricey. Like a pair of Zara jeans, the Peugeot E-5008 looks just as stylish as its more expensive alternatives, but for a fraction of the price. Considering that the E-5008 is over £10,000 less than the Kia EV9 , it looks like pretty good value, and it’s around £35,000 less than the Volvo EX90 ; yet the Peugeot might just be the more stylish car. Much like its smaller E-3008 counterpart, the E-5008 is one of the most striking cars on sale - period. It's a kaleidoscope of crisp lines and sharp corners, with an enormous grille and the signature lion claw headlight design. It may not have the swoopy roofline and compact rear end of the E-3008, but the E-5008 has just as much road presence - and a lot more practicality. Range: 310-414 miles Efficiency: 3.5 - 4.3mi/kWh Battery size: 73kWh, 97kWh Max charge speed: 160kW Charge time AC: 4hrs, 20-80%, 11kW Charge time DC: 30mins, 20-80%, 160kW Charge port location: Left side rear Power outputs: 210hp, 230hp, 320hp The interior carries the angular theme into the car, with a fabric-trimmed wraparound dashboard, slick 21-inch widescreen infotainment-and-instrument display and a funky two-spoke steering wheel beneath it. The infotainment display isn’t just good to look at, but it’s fairly easy to use too. A secondary display underneath the air vents has customisable touchscreen buttons, while there’s another row of haptic controls beneath it. It’s just a shame that all of the shortcuts direct you back to the main screen, because while you can use Peugeot’s own infotainment at the same time as the climate controls, you have to totally exit Apple CarPlay or Android Auto to change the temperature. Frustrating. What isn’t frustrating is just how practical the E-5008 is, with lots of storage around the cabin and plenty of space across the front two rows. Tall adults won’t struggle for headroom or legroom behind a tall driver, for example, and up front there are two cubbies in the centre console as well as a wireless charging pad for your phone. Unfortunately the third-row of seats isn’t all that spacious, and it’s best reserved for children or short journeys. You’ll fit six adults under six-foot across all three rows, but it’ll feel a little claustrophobic in the back after a while. While it’s not an EV, the Volkswagen Tayron has more space inside. As a seven-seater, you still get some cargo space - about the same size as a small hatchback - which will easily take some shopping or a few backpacks. With the third row of seats stowed away there’s an enormous 915-litre boot; long trips away will be no bother with that much space for luggage in the back. Long trips away are a real option in the E-5008 too, because you have a claimed 310 miles of range in the single and dual-motor small battery models. That shoots up to a very impressive 403 miles in the bigger battery, long-range car, and the E-5008 is an excellent choice to take on a long road trip; it’s exceptionally quiet and comfortable on the move. Around town it’s easy to manoeuvre for its size, and its suspension does a superb job of absorbing bumps and blows, but it’s on the motorway where it impresses most with minimal wind and road noise and a pillowy-soft ride at speed. Country lanes aren’t fun though, even in the dual-motor model with its firmer suspension, and while the E-5008 feels capable it’s best driven along at a steady pace. As a practical, comfortable and stylish family car it makes for a strong contender, and we’ve got some great new Peugeot E-5008 deals here on Carwow. We’ve also got Peugeot E-5008 lease deals , and there are used Peugeot E-5008s available through our network of trusted dealers.

https://www.carwow.co.uk/peugeot/3008,Peugeot 3008 Review & Prices,"£36,790",8/10,"Peugeot ’s 3008 has shot up the ranks since the first one was launched more than a decade ago. It may have started as a tall (and somewhat ugly) crossover , but now it’s a fully-fledged SUV -coupe, with really stylish looks and much more high-tech kit. It’s like someone who used to be a bit podgy, but has hit the gym and overhauled their wardrobe. While the all-electric version, the E-3008 , might get all the headlines, a big chunk of the 3008’s sales in the UK will be taken by this, the hybrid model — not least because, in spite of all the new on-board technology, it’s a fairly handy £10,000 less expensive than the E-3008… That being said, there are plenty of compelling alternatives to the Peugeot 3008, many of which are a bit more affordable. Some of the best all-rounders include the Nissan Qashqai , Kia Sportage and Hyundai Tucson . Then there's the practical, great value Citroen C5 Aircross and stylish but impractical Toyota C-HR to consider, too. Power for the 3008 Hybrid comes from a 134bhp 1.2-litre three-cylinder petrol engine — that’s the same one that Peugeot has been making for donkey’s years, but it’s been upgraded for life as a hybrid. The system sort of sits between a ‘traditional’ Toyota-style full hybrid and a mild-hybrid . So, the 3008 Hybrid can drive itself on electric power alone, but only for very short bursts at very low speeds. It’s good for around town, but less useful on long motorway hauls. Peugeot reckons you’ll get 51mpg out of it, and CO2 emissions are kept to a trim 124g/km. Inside, there’s a huge, sweeping all-digital 21.0-inch screen that dominates the cabin. It sits up and away from the driver, almost resting against the windscreen. As is Peugeot’s recent tradition, the steering wheel is small, hexagonal, and sits more or less in your lap. We've tried it in the E-3008 and it's much easier to find a comfortable driving position where the wheel doesn't block the instrument display than ever before, but it's probably still worth trying before you buy. To the right of the steering wheel is a slim touchpad which has configurable shortcut buttons for the big screen so that you can access the menus you need more easily, but sadly Peugeot insists on putting all of the climate control functions on the screen, which makes it more fiddly than it needs to be. The gear lever is now a chunky toggle switch behind the steering wheel, so that leaves the centre console free for cupholders and storage spaces, of which there are loads, and the 3008’s mixture of back-lighting and soft fabric surfaces on the dashboard make for a cabin that’s almost good enough to challenge the mighty Germans on quality, and surpass them on design. In spite of that rakish roof, there’s good space in the back seats, even for grown-ups, although those with longer legs will find that their feet and knees sit up a bit too high, as the floor has been raised up to make space for the electric version’s battery pack. The boot is a useful 520 litres, but that sloping roofline makes loading in really bulky items a bit of a challenge, and alternatives such as the Hyundai Tucson have a larger capacity. Speaking of that roofline, the Peugeot 3008 is a really good-looking thing. It manages to be imposingly chunky while also sporting sleek lines and cool details such as Peugeot's signature three-claw light designs. Stick with Carwow if you want the best Peugeot 3008 deals .

https://www.carwow.co.uk/peugeot/e-408,Peugeot E-408 Review & Prices,"£42,185",Not found,"The Peugeot E-408 is the new electric version of the 408, a swoopy saloon/coupé/pseudo-SUV. It’s a bit like a Picasso painting; there’s a lot going on wherever you look, but it all comes together to make something rather striking. It’s yet another entrant into the coupé- SUV market, making it an alternative to the Renault Rafale , Citroen C5 X , Cupra Formentor and the Ford Mustang Mach-E . It may not be a ‘classically’ handsome design, but it’s hard to deny that the E-408 is a stylish car; even if it’s in an unconventional way. Peugeot is definitely showing some of its old ways with its current range, and the E-408 brings with it some additional French flair. Aggressive, pointy headlights and a ‘gradient’ grille give the E-408 a sporty nose, whilst at the back you’ll find a little flick-up spoiler above a pseudo-light bar and a rather large diffuser-style bumper trim. The fastback-style sloping roof and angular shoulder line give the jacked-up coupe a purposeful stance. Range: 281 Miles Efficiency: 3.5-4.5 miles per kWh Battery size: 58kWh Max charge speed: 100kW Charge time AC: 5hrs20mins, 0-100%, 11kWh Charge time DC: 35mins, 20-80%, 100kWh Charge port location: Left Side Rear Power outputs: 210hp The angular design theme continues inside the E-408, with a dashboard design that’s much less curvy than any alternatives. That’s not a critique though, in fact the multimedia display and control buttons facing the driver give the cockpit a real fighter-jet vibe; as does the small squared-off steering wheel perched below the driver display. Be warned though, some drivers might find that the steering wheel gets in the way of the driver’s screen if you set it too high so bear that in mind when getting comfy in the driver’s seat. Just like its petrol and hybrid stablemates, the E-408’s cabin will be full of posh, soft-touch materials and good standard kit. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto should be all you need these days, but if you’re a fan of manufacturer systems then Peugeot’s own ‘i-Connect’ infotainment system is a great one to use. The rakish roofline would suggest that rear seat and boot space is compromised but you’d be surprised. Boot space is less than a petrol-powered 408 but the same as the 408 hybrid, whilst rear seat space is likely to be the same too. Expect adequate head room for adults in the back, even if it is a little cosy for shoulder space. When it comes to performance, the E-408 is no slouch but don’t go expecting lap records either. A 210hp motor and 58kWh battery promises up to 281 miles of range which is similar to what alternatives can manage. The E-408 can go from 20-80% charge in 30 minutes on a 100kW rapid charger, which is okay, if not fantastic We’ll have a full review for you as soon as we get our hands on this swoopy-looking electric car, but in the meantime you can get ahead on Carwow’s Peugeot E-408 deals .

https://www.carwow.co.uk/peugeot/5008,Peugeot 5008 Review & Prices,"£39,490",9/10,"The Peugeot 5008 is the bigger, seven-seat sibling of the Peugeot 3008 . It has the same underpinnings as that car - same engines, hybrid systems, and even most of the same interior. But it’s larger, with more space in the cabin and a much bigger boot. It’s like swapping jackets for one that looks the same but has massive hidden pockets. We like it so much the Peugeot 5008 received a Highly Commended award in the Family Values category at the 2025 Carwow Car of the Year Awards . It certainly cuts a rug, and makes a stylish alternative to the likes of the Skoda Kodiaq , Hyundai Santa Fe and Nissan X-Trail . There is a fully electric Peugeot E-5008 , which we’ve reviewed separately, but this page will focus on the simpler and more affordable hybrid and plug-in hybrid models. At the front, the 5008 shares its style with the smaller 3008. There’s a huge body-coloured grille which stretches across the whole front of the car, flanked by LED daytime running lights which are meant to look as though a lion (Peugeot’s mascot) has slashed the front of the car with its claws. Though it’s not exactly pretty, the effect is striking and it stands out in a world of anonymous-looking family SUVs such as the Volkswagen Tiguan . Further back, the 5008 gets a much squarer roofline than the dramatically sloping 3008. It’s quite blocky, but that’s necessary to provide good headroom for the occupants of the third row of seats - and a bigger boot when it’s folded away. It certainly pays off, as the middle row of seats has way more space for heads, knees and feet than you get in the 3008. You also get three individual rear seats which split and fold in a 40:20:40 arrangement, making it much more flexible for balancing passengers and load space. The third row has space for adults for very short trips - though kids will be more comfortable back there. Even the 5008’s 348-litre boot (with all the seats up) is pretty reasonable, but with just five seats in place you get a mammoth 916 litres of space, which is bigger than the Hyundai Santa Fe or the Skoda Kodiaq. Front-seat passengers are well catered-for too, with a dashboard that goes hard on high-tech features. There’s a huge screen setup that stretches right across the top of the dash and covers off driver information and infotainment, plus a configurable panel of ‘i-Toggles’ which lets you set customisable shortcuts to almost any of the car’s functions. There’s no question that it looks good, even if the styling is a little busy, and it feels great too. The plastics are high quality and much of the dash is covered in fabric, giving it a softer, sofa-like feel that’s very luxurious. Engine options are both hybrid - there’s a 136hp 1.2-litre which sounds as though it’s going to be way too weedy, but actually copes well even with a fully-loaded car. If you’d prefer something a little more effortless, there’s a 196hp plug-in hybrid which can manage up to 48 miles of fully electric range and promises super-low fuel bills if you keep it topped up. Regardless of engine, the 5008 is comfortable to drive, though shelve any expectations you might have that this model has anything to do with the brand’s Peugeot Sport division. Despite the supportive seats and sporty steering wheel, the 5008 is not set up to be fun in the corners - instead, it’s easy and relaxing to drive.

https://www.carwow.co.uk/peugeot/208-gti,Peugeot 208 GTi Review and Prices,"£10,545",8/10,"The Peugeot 208 GTi is the successor to one of the greatest hot hatches ever, the 205 GTi. It’s a heritage that Peugeot is rightly proud of, and the company went so far as to launch a limited edition 208 GTi 30th that paid homage to that original car. Of course, today’s 208 is very different to that 205, but what hasn’t changed in the last 30 years is that the market for hot hatches is fiercely contested and the Peugeot 208 GTi is an alternative to fine cars such as the Ford Fiesta ST and Volkswagen Polo GTi. Even from the outside, the bodykit, badges and red details make it obvious that this is no ordinary 208 and the theme continues inside. Here, you’ll find a strictly red and black colour scheme, with red flashes on the door pulls, air vent surrounds, seat stitching, and on the side of the gear knob. There are GTi badges all over the place, too, as well as a rally-inspired red strip on the top of the steering wheel so that it’s easy to see when you’re pointing straight ahead. Unfortunately, that steering wheel is the main point of contention inside the Peugeot 208 GTi – as it is in any 208. The wheel is unusually small, and deliberately set low so that the driver looks at the dials over the top of the rim, rather than through the wheel. Some people love it, but others just can’t get on with it. So, it’s something to consider if you’re in the market for a car like this, because whether you like it is very much down to personal taste. One thing that everyone can agree on is the Peugeot 208 GTi’s sporty yet comfortable ride. On a bumpy road, where rivals like the Fiesta ST can feel just too firm and bounce around when you’re driving fast, the Peugeot feels under more control more of the time. You can attack corners with complete confidence and, in the right hands on a twisty road, this talented little car is more than capable of surprising much more powerful cars. Exactly how a hot hatch should be, then. I can remember the original 205 GTi and the 208 GTi isn’t as good as that, but it’s the first Peugeot hot hatch I’ve liked so much in a long time Behind that performance is a 205hp 1.6-litre turbocharged engine co-developed with BMW that will get this pocket rocket to 60mph in just over six seconds. It’s even claimed to return more than 50mpg, according to Peugeot – assuming you can drive it like a saint. If you can’t do that, you can at least be happy that the GTi comes with a decent amount of equipment, including 17-inch alloy wheels and sparkling LED daytime running lights. Inside, meanwhile, there’s a DAB radio and dual-zone climate control, plus automatic headlights and wipers. Sports seats keep you in place in fast corners and there’s GTi-specific red lighting for the dial surrounds. So far, so good, but the problem for anyone considering a 208 GTi is the Ford Fiesta ST. Not only is it cheaper to buy, it’s also even better to drive. Nevertheless, the Peugeot is a still a very good hot hatch that you could happily drive every day. It may not quite recapture the magic of the 205, but it is by far the best hot hatch that Peugeot has produced in recent memory"
https://www.carwow.co.uk/peugeot/e-traveller,Peugeot e-Traveller Review & Prices,"£48,925",Not found,"The large and boxy Peugeot e-Traveller can’t hide its van origins on the outside, but its interior looks and feels much like a contemporary family car. With the added benefit of tons of space and plenty of configurability. You can decide on the number and layout of the seats as well as standard and long wheelbase versions. This is essentially a customisable chest of drawers with wheels. All versions are powered by a 134bhp electric motor paired to a 50kWh battery pack. There are three driving modes (Eco, Normal and Power), each progressively increasing the available power output. A range of 148 miles is claimed on the WLTP cycle, with a charge from 0-80% taking 30-minutes using a 100kW fast charger. An 11kW wallbox will do the job in 5 hours. If you’re in a tight spot and need to charge from a domestic wall socket, it will take 31 hours to get from 0-100%. It's the same as the Citroen e-SpaceTourer and Vauxhall Vivaro Life Electric , which are almost identical bar the front-end styling. The two trims on offer are called Business and Business VIP, a subtle hint at what Peugeot expects most e-Travellers will be used for. That doesn’t preclude it from being a rather practical family vehicle though, especially since you can seat between four to nine occupants based on the seat layout. Both trims can be had in standard and long wheelbase versions. The base trim comes with manual air conditioning, rear parking sensors, cloth seats and 17-inch black steel wheels. Business VIP adds several useful extras like keyless entry, hands free electric sliding rear doors and sat nav. An optional safety pack adds driver aids like adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning and automatic emergency braking. Interior space is cavernous, with up to 1,162 litres of boot space available on long wheelbase models even with nine seats in place. With five seats in place, you can pack in 3,000-litres of cargo (4,900-litres with both rear rows removed). The huge rear tailgate and low load lip make it easier to load bulky and heavy items. See how much a Peugeot e-Traveller will cost through carwow, or check out our savings on the entire Peugeot range . We've also got plenty of used Peugeots on offer, and when you're ready to buy your next car, you can sell your car through carwow too."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/peugeot/2008,Peugeot 2008 Review & Prices,"£27,050",8/10,"The Peugeot 2008 is a small SUV with a bold look, comprising strong colour schemes and a variety of slashes and creases that make alternatives such as the Volkswagen T-Cross look more than a little tedious. If small SUVs are more rugged versions of small cars, then the Peugeot 2008 is a 208 that’s kitted out for a paintballing trip. It has the same great tech you get in the hatchback, but is better prepared for some countryside pursuits thanks to its raised ride height. And the French flair loses no momentum when you get inside, helped by a 2023 update that saw a 10.0-inch infotainment display fitted as standard. The digital driver's display (standard on all but the base model) that sits above the teeny tiny steering wheel looks great, and has a cool 3D-effect on top-spec models that works with the fancy dashboard design to offer a neat appearance that's tough to match at this price point. Not many do better than the Peugeot for front-seat room, either. It will easily accommodate two tall adults and there’s plenty of scope to move the seat and steering wheel, though lumbar adjustment – which helps keep you comfy on long drives – is only optional on top-spec versions. Back seat space is less impressive, though. Tall passengers will have their knees brushing the front seats if they’re sitting behind someone else who’s tall. On the upside, there is plenty of head and foot room. In the boot, the 2008 has 434 litres to work with, which is better than the Skoda Kamiq and Seat Arona , but falls short of the Volkswagen T-Cross and Ford Puma . Hit the road and you’ll find the 2008 is a great all-rounder. Its steering is light in town, but weights up to give you more confidence at faster speeds. The slick six-speed manual gearbox (top-spec models get an eight-speed automatic) is the perfect match for the Peugeot’s sporty small steering wheel, though that's where the sportiness ends. It's relatively fun on a winding road, but it's happier taking things easy. The most powerful engine helps make it a bit more enjoyable, though. It has 130hp and is both sprightly and cheap to run. The manual Allure version is a bit more economical than the automatic GT, but official figures make the entry level 100hp engine the cheapest to run. But what makes the 2008 stand out from alternatives is its eye-catching styling that proves cheap-to-run and practical family cars can still be desirable. For that reason alone, it’s worth shortlisting against cars like the Seat Arona and VW T-Cross. And, of course, the 2008 is available in fully electric E-2008 form. If you’re sold on the idea, check out the latest Peugeot 2008 deals on carwow, where you can also find a variety of used Peugeot 2008 models. You can also get good prices on used Peugeots , and if you want to change your car completely, you can sell your car through carwow to get the best price."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/byd/sealion-7,BYD Sealion 7 Review & Prices,"£47,000",7/10,"The BYD Sealion 7 is a roomy electric SUV with sporty looks, impressive specs and a very reasonable price tag - on paper, a brilliant alternative to electric vehicles such as the Tesla Model Y , Kia EV6 or Peugeot E-3008 . BYD’s models can be a bit hit and miss, though. The Seal and Dolphin are really good electric cars, but the Seal U plug-in hybrid SUV is rather disappointing. The Sealion 7 is a mixed bag - it's not as outwardly brilliant as the Seal, but it's far better than the Seal U and a credible alternative to the aforementioned Tesla. The Sealion 7 gets off to a reasonable start because while it’s not exactly handsome, it’s a bit less anonymous than the Seal U. BYD’s signature headlight design features C-shape LEDs, sat above a chunky bumper design with big air intakes. A sleek, sloping roofline trails rearward to a tailgate spoiler and a full-width rear lightbar. Inside, things are a bit less lukewarm - it’s genuinely nice inside, with posh-feeling materials swaddling every surface and an interesting dashboard design covered in flowing lines. There’s a huge 15.6-inch infotainment screen with BYD’s trademark rotating party trick - this is cool the first few times, but is likely to be relegated to gimmick status after you’ve shown your mates. Range: 283-312 miles Battery size: 82.5kWh / 91.3kWh Max charge speed: 150kW / 230kW Charge time DC: 32mins, 10-80%, 150kW / 24mins, 10-80%, 230kW Charge port location: Right side rear Power outputs: 313hp / 530hp There are some materials that feel a little bit cheap considering that the Sealion 7 isn’t a budget machine, but overall it feels quite premium - even if it’s lacking the wow factor of a Peugeot E-3008. No such caveats when it comes to the space on offer, though. The front seats are big, squashy and comfortable, and the storage solutions for smaller items are useful - but the back seats are huge, so rear passengers will be able to stretch out as much as they’d like. You won’t have any issues fitting lanky teens or bulky child seats back here, though the middle seat backrest is quite uncomfortable so it’s certainly better for two people. At 520 litres in capacity, boot space can’t hold a candle to the Tesla Model Y but it’s pretty good compared with most other alternatives. There’s a deep underfloor storage compartment and even a useful ‘frunk’ where you’d find the engine on a combustion-powered car. The Sealion 7 offers a choice of two large battery packs, with a claimed range of between 283-312 miles. That sounds good on paper, but during our testing we saw really poor efficiency which would suggest that even the larger battery will only return a figure in the 200s. Not so good. It is powerful, though, and the motors are smooth and silent, so getting up to speed on the motorway is easy. It’s a shame that the rest of the car isn’t quite as refined - there’s a lot of wind noise and tyre roar. Worse still, the Sealion 7’s suspension feels very unsettled. It bounces a lot over bumps, and you can feel the body moving long after you've passed a road imperfection. It’s like being in a rather unstable ship at sea. On top of this, twitchy and hyperactive steering means it’s not even much fun to drive down a twisting B-road, which is a shame. The Sealion 7 is an interesting left-field choice if you value technology and passenger space, but the alternatives all have more enticing driving dynamics and better range, for less cash.

https://www.carwow.co.uk/byd/seal-u,BYD Seal U Review & Prices,"£33,315",6/10,"It’s not immediately obvious what sort of car the BYD Seal U is from the name alone - it sounds like it should be related to the all-electric BYD Seal saloon. However, it’s instead a plug-in hybrid family-sized SUV which majors on value - coming in comfortably cheaper than many much smaller hatchbacks and SUVs. It’s also quite a frustrating car, as it doesn’t do things by halves. In some aspects it’s good - very good, arguably near the top of its class. In others, however, it’s firmly near the bottom, making it difficult to recommend. It’s like buying products from Temu or Aliexpress - they can be very good or very bad, but rarely are they just average. The Seal U is a similar size to plug-in hybrid SUVs such as the Hyundai Tucson , Ford Kuga and Volkswagen Tiguan , but it’s closer in price to cars such as the Kia Niro or Jeep Renegade , both of which are a lot smaller. The closest alternative is the MG HS , which comes in at a similar size and a similar price for its plug-in hybrid variant. The BYD Seal U starts on the back foot because of its design. Whereas BYD’s other cars are at least distinctive if not particularly pretty, the Seal U looks like every other SUV was popped into a blender. It’s so anonymous that it would make the perfect getaway car, but the result is that you don’t feel particularly proud or excited to be climbing aboard. At least you’ll have plenty of room inside. Space in the front and rear seats is excellent, with space for a six-foot passenger to stretch out behind a driver of a similar size. The boot isn’t quite so impressive, at 425 litres in capacity - most alternatives offer more room. It’s still a useful space, though, as it’s deep and wide - just not very tall. Those sat up front enjoy loads of tech as standard, and a cabin design that’s rather more distinctive than the exterior styling. You get BYD’s trademark rotating touchscreen infotainment system - 15.6-inches across, it’s huge, clear and responsive, even if the interface doesn’t always make the most sense. Other luxurious features include things like full-cabin air purification, which senses when there are lots of pollutants outside (or even inside) the vehicle and can filter them out. It’s driving the Seal U which highlights its Marmite nature more than anything else. The hybrid powertrain is truly excellent, but the rest of the driving experience is very poor. The Seal U runs on its electric motors most of the time, with the petrol engine acting mostly as a generator and only kicking in fully if you put your foot all the way down. That means progress is smooth, if not hugely rapid, and makes the Seal U fantastic for driving around town. Good range on a charge and a generally quiet cabin free of too much wind and road noise further this aspect. But the Seal U’s suspension is so soft that it wallows over bumps like a ship in rough seas, and the steering is so light that it feels as if you’re driving a remote controlled-car. This is especially a shame given that the Seal saloon with which the Seal U (sort of) shares a name is really good to drive.

https://www.carwow.co.uk/byd/atto-3,BYD Atto 3 Review & Prices,"£37,705",7/10,"Like a foreign exchange student in a high school movie, nobody knew what to expect when the Atto 3 came over to the UK. And just like the main character in those films, it fit in better than anyone expected, and BYD has just been getting more and more popular ever since. But where it’s found its place with the Seal , Dolphin and Sealion 7 , you can tell that Atto 3 is part of its learning curve; not quite as stylish as the Peugeot E-2008 or as sleek as the Volvo EX30 . BYD has played it safe with the Atto 3’s styling, and while it’s by no means an ugly car, it has a fairly generic design that might have you daydreaming about its alternatives, as opposed to screaming ‘Build Your Dreams.’ It seems as though BYD’s designers saved all of their interest and intrigue for the Atto 3’s interior because wow, what a wild cabin it has. From the embossed strakes across the dashboard surface to the ‘guitar strings’ on the door pockets, it might be the most fascinating interior in the small SUV market. Range: 261 miles Efficiency: 4.0 mi/kWh Battery size: 60kWh Max charge speed: 88kW Charge time AC: 9hrs 42mins, 0-100%, 7kW Charge time DC: 44mins, 10-80%, 150kW Charge port location: Right front Power outputs: 204hp There’s a ‘floating’, rotatable, 15.6-inch infotainment screen in the middle, in front of a dash-top which resembles a stringray’s pectoral wings. The driver gets their own digital instrument display, though the graphics lag behind alternatives’ screens and it looks a bit cheap, compared to the central display. Still, the steering wheel is swanky and the interior quality is impressive almost everywhere you touch, which can’t be said for a lot of cars at this price point. Apple CarPlay / Android Auto come as standard, plus quirks such as the rotary door handles and in-built karaoke mode add even more character. It’s fairly spacious too, with loads of storage space in the front and back and generally comfortable front seats - though they lack lumbar support. There’s good legroom in the back too, and although it could do with a touch more headroom, the Atto 3 makes up for it with a decently-sized 440-litre boot. There’s a single battery option for the Atto 3, and while it has a 260-mile claimed range, we found it would struggle to reach 200 miles to a charge in the real world, in mixed conditions. And the city is where the Atto 3 shines, with good all-round visibility and standard-fit 360-degree parking cameras. It’s comfortable over bumpy roads too, thanks to its soft suspension, though there’s noticeable wind noise on the motorway and the Atto 3 doesn’t feel particularly stable on country lanes. Some of BYD’s Chinese alternatives have brought lacklustre models to the UK as their first attempts to crack our market, but the Atto 3 marked BYD’s position as a brand worth keeping an eye on. It’s not quite the same level of fit and finish as the Kia EV3 or Renault Scenic E-Tech , but the quirky interior and good standard kit are notable. Check out new BYD Atto 3 deals on Carwow, or BYD Atto 3 lease deals to get one on your driveway without paying a hefty lump sum. There are used BYD Atto 3s available through our network of trusted dealers, and other used BYD models available if you want to browse their full range.

https://www.carwow.co.uk/byd/seal,BYD Seal Review & Prices,"£45,705",8/10,"The BYD Seal is a bit like the kid who joins the school halfway through Year 11 and yet finishes the year as rugby captain, prefect and top of the exam tables. You see, while BYD has only been selling cars in the UK since summer 2023, the Seal is an electric saloon car that displays maturity and ability that you’d expect from a highly established European manufacturer. In fact, in many ways it’s actually an improvement on the Tesla Model 3 and Hyundai Ioniq 6 which constitute its two closest alternatives. Other electric cars you might consider are the Polestar 2 and BMW i4 . While BYD may have launched the Sealion 7 and Seal U in the years since, the Seal is still a better car than either. Ignore the slightly odd naming convention for a while, though, and focus for a second on the styling - which is great. The Seal is a similar shape to the Tesla Model 3, being a saloon car with a dropped snout and rounded roofline - but it has more intricate detailing around the headlights and a neat lightbar at the rear. It’s a bit less anonymous than the Tesla without being too glam. On the inside, though, it’s like BYD’s stylists took one look at Tesla’s minimalist approach and simply said ‘no, thank you’. The dashboard is very distinctive as a result, with air vents that seamlessly mould into full-width panels running across the cabin. There are posh quilted seats and a panel of switchgear in the centre. It all feels quite upmarket, if unconventional. Range: 323-354 miles Efficiency: 3.4-3.7mi/kWh Battery size: 83kWh Max charge speed: 150kW Charge time DC: 37mins, 10-80%, 150kW Charge port location: Right side rear Power outputs: 313hp / 530hp Even more unconventional is the infotainment screen, which is a huge 15.6-inches across. BYD’s party piece is that the screen physically rotates from portrait to landscape at the touch of a button. The company says this is because things like the sat-nav are better in portrait mode, but as the standard-fit Apple CarPlay and Android Auto only works in landscape you’ll probably leave the rotating trick as a once-in-a-blue-moon showoff rather than a regular feature. The interface isn’t quite as good as you get in a Model 3 or Ioniq 6, either. The BYD Seal’s screen is bright, clear and responsive, but common functions are buried just a few menus too deep with buttons that are too hard to hit on the move. Drivers and front passengers of all sizes will be able to get comfy up front in those squashy, quilted leather seats, and there’s good stowage for smaller items too. The back seats are a bit more of a squeeze, with decent legroom but headroom that’s limited by the huge panoramic glass roof. Boot space of 402 litres matches the Ioniq 6 but trails the Model 3. There is a handy front boot for storing charge cables, though. Just note that, as a saloon car, the Seal isn’t as practical for large items as a Polestar 2. To drive, the Seal  is deeply impressive. Even the standard rear-wheel drive model is quick, but performance from the all-wheel drive, 530hp Excellence version is mind-bending and, unlike a Tesla, totally repeatable. Responsive and accurate steering, plus suspension that strikes a great balance between comfort and cornering, means it’s even a good amount of fun on a twisty road. Competitive range figures of 323 - 354 miles are the icing on the cake, though it’s a shame there’s no super-long range version to challenge the best Tesla Model 3. Still, the BYD Seal is a car that should definitely be on your shortlist. Interested? Check out our best BYD Seal deals here , or get a great price on a BYD Seal lease .

https://www.carwow.co.uk/byd/dolphin,BYD Dolphin Review & Prices,"£26,205",8/10,"The BYD Dolphin is a mid-sized electric car bringing good levels of equipment and decent practicality, as well as a low starting price – all attributes that make it highly attractive if you're in the market for an EV and you don't want an SUV. Chinese brand BYD launched in the UK with the Atto 3 SUV , and its second model, also all-electric, is the Dolphin. Think of it as a pocket telescope - not impressive in size, but its compact dimensions belie its abilities to show users more than they bargained for. For example, the entry car’s price undercuts potential alternatives such as the MG 4 , and significantly undercuts the likes of the Cupra Born , VW ID3 and Smart #1 , as well as the smaller Renault Zoe and Peugeot e-208 . But equipment levels impress, with kit including electrically adjustable vegan leather seats, a 360-degree surround camera and 12.8-inch rotatable screen all standard on even the entry car. But only the cars over £30,000 get the longer-range battery. And yep, rotatable. At the touch of a button, as long as you’re not using the landscape-only Apple CarPlay/Android Auto, the big infotainment screen will switch from landscape to portrait or back again. Most people will pick a layout and stick with it, but a neat party trick nonetheless. Range: 196-265 miles Efficiency: 3.9-4.1mi/kWh Battery size: 45kWh / 60kWh Max charge speed: 150kW Charge time AC: 5hrs, 0-100%, 11kW / 6hrs 12mins, 0-100%, 11kW Charge time DC: 40mins, 10-80%, 150kW Charge port location: Right side front Power outputs: 95hp / 177hp / 204hp The Dolphin comes in four different trim levels, only two of which offer the same battery, power, range and charging stats. At the bottom is the Active which has 95hp and a 211-mile range, while the top-spec Design has 204hp and 265 miles of range. We’ll go into more detail on the different options later on, and the two lower-price cars aren't available until a couple of months after launch. Once past the slightly odd name, the Dolphin has a subtly inoffensive style to it; nothing likely to court car park controversy, but it’s neat enough. On the inside, there is plenty to catch the eye, from the rounded set of switches below the screen that also house the gear selector, to the sweeping air vent surrounds that form part of a dynamic line across the dashboard. Rear seat space is surprisingly good for a car that doesn’t have a big footprint, with taller adults easily able to get comfortable one behind the other. That’s helped by the flat floor – a result of clever battery packaging – and the fact that you can get your feet just about under the front seats. Three rear passengers will be a squeeze though, which isn’t a big surprise in a fairly compact hatchback. Boot space is reasonable, and there’s a handy removable rubber mat to keep wet dogs or muddy boots off the carpeted moveable boot floor. It’s a deep space when set in the lower position, and offers a little more room that a Smart #1, Renault Zoe or MG 4, although not quite as much as a Volkswagen ID3 or Cupra Born. To drive, the most powerful of the three power options is a little too powerful for the tyres, especially in the wet where they have a tendency to easily spin the wheels. BYD has acknowledged they’re not perfect, and will be changing the tyres it fits to the Dolphin for cars built from November 2023. Otherwise it’s a pleasant and relaxed experience, although the car doesn’t always smooth itself over urban bumps. But it’s grown-up enough to settle in fine on longer runs, and the light steering is welcome for low-speed manoeuvring, although at higher speeds the standard setting is too light for engaging or spirited driving. It can be altered in the menus though, which helps. Much like the Fiat 500e , the Dolphin’s smaller battery should be ignored by anyone venturing far from home. The lower range is fine for urban jaunts, but the extra capacity of the bigger battery provides significant peace of mind.

https://www.carwow.co.uk/gwm/ora-03,GWM Ora 03 Review & Prices,"£25,005",6/10,"The Ora 03 is the first car to go on sale in the UK from Chinese car firm GWM. It might look like it’s Mini-sized in photos, but it’s actually close to a Volkswagen ID3 in dimensions, so it’s closer to a small SUV than a small city car. If you’re looking at an Ora 03 then cars like the Volvo EX30 , Smart #1 and MG4 may also be on your shopping list. You might know this car as the Ora Funky Cat, but it was renamed at the end of 2023. That's a shame because the odd name felt apt, as the best way to describe this electric car's styling is, well, ‘funky’. It looks like the result of an amorous evening between a Volkswagen Beetle and a Mini , and the result is a handsome family EV which stands out on the road. The funkiness continues with an elaborate headlight and taillight show when you unlock it, and some fish that swim across the screens when you open the door. Cute. Inside it’s similarly smart, with high-quality materials to be found throughout. It feels much more upmarket than the ID3, for example. The twin 10.25-inch displays are bright and crisp, however they can be a fiddle to operate. You do get voice commands as well through, and these work very well. Even the base model comes fully loaded with wireless phone charging, an excellent range of cameras for parking and low speed manoeuvres, LED headlights and much more. More good news is found in the back seats, where even taller adults will have plenty of room. It’s just as posh as the front and the arm rest has a couple of cup holders. On the down side, the Ora 03 is fairly narrow so it can be a bit of a squeeze for three adults. The boot is the Ora 03's weak point. At 228 litres it’s a bit bigger than the Mini Cooper Electric . But this car is the size of an ID3, which has a 385-litre boot. There’s some under-floor storage but you’ll probably have to store your cables in the main compartment, while a big load lip makes it difficult to lift heavy items in and out. Behind the wheel, the Ora 03 is at its best in the city. The steering is light, making it easy to manoeuvre in tight spaces. Acceleration is slow to pick up from a standstill but it’s quick and responsive once on the move. The suspension does an adequate job of soaking up bumps as well, although it can get a bit fidgety over smaller imperfections. On the motorway there is a lot of wind noise, which can be annoying over long distances. It’s not as comfortable at higher speeds either, while most alternatives, such as the MG4, are more fun to drive in the corners. There are two battery options for the Ora 03, the larger of which will do up to 260 miles on a charge. Not bad, but a Volkswagen ID3 can manage up to 357 miles and the cheaper MG 4 SE has 281 miles of range. Overall, the GWM Ora 03 is a decent addition to the UK’s family car market. It provides a high-quality and spacious alternative to more traditional brands and outperforms them in many ways. However, its small boot and disappointing motorway driving do count against it. If you like the look of the GWM Ora 03 and are interested in getting behind the wheel, check out our Ora 03 deals to see how much you could save. Or check out used GWM Ora 03s here . Remember too, that when the time comes to sell your old car you can do that right here through Carwow's network of trusted dealers."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/gwm/haval-jolion-pro,GWM Haval Jolion Pro Review & Prices,"£24,275",Not found,"To the list of Chinese car brands entering the UK market, you can now add Haval. Except that Haval, while it hasn’t specifically been on sale here before, kind of has already as it’s part of GWM , or Great Wall Motors, the people behind the little GWM Ora 03 . The Jolion Pro at least avoids the overly-cutesy name of its all-electric cousin, although once again you’d have to ask precisely what’s the right way to pronounce it — is it Joe-Lion? Or Jole-Eon? You’d better figure that out as all of your friends are going to be asking exactly what you’ve bought, should you take the Haval plunge. Apparently the name derives from the Mandarin ‘chu lian’, which means ‘first love’. While some Chinese brands are already starting to look upmarket, and to try and compete with the big German brands, Haval is taking a refreshingly straightforward approach with the Jolion — it’s a big-ish SUV , about the same size as a Kia Sportage , but it’s being sold for way less than the price of a Kia Niro , and with lots of standard equipment too. The Jolion has the advantage of looking a bit more conventional than some of the other Chinese cars hitting the UK market. Perhaps a bit too conventional — it certainly doesn’t stand out from the crowd — but it’s certainly not offensive. It’s as if someone passed a Ford Kuga , a Kia Sportage, and a Lexus NX through an AI programme and the Jolion was what came out the other end. In fact, perhaps that’s exactly what happened… Up front, there’s a big grille and slim lights, while from the side the Jolion is going to be seriously easily confused with the Ford . The rear is quite Lexus -y, with a wrapover LED light bar. It’s all neat and pleasant, but without any sense of distinction. Inside, the Jolion looks rather a lot like you’d expect — a big screen, some slightly fussy digital instruments, and a chunky steering wheel that’s one-part Jeep , one-part MG . Overall quality looks OK, if nothing special, and at least there are some proper physical buttons to help with that touchscreen. Oddly, there’s no option to have built-in sat-nav, and there’s also no DAB radio, leaving you stuck with AM/FM unless you have an unlimited data plan for your mobile. Space is excellent, especially in the back seats where there’s almost too much rear legroom. In fact, there really is too much rear legroom, as the space in the rear cabin eats so badly into boot volume that this big, roomy SUV has a boot which measures just 255 litres. For comparison’s sake, the tiny Skoda Fabia hatchback has a 380 litre boot… While you’re getting over that shock, the Jolion does try to calm you down with a very conventional hybrid system. This is based around a four-cylinder 1.5-litre petrol engine, and the combined power output is 190hp, thanks to a very powerful electric motor. 0-62mph takes a claimed 9.0 seconds, which isn’t too bad for a big-ish SUV. As with the Nissan Qashqai e-Power , the idea is that the Jolion’s electric motor does most of the driving, most of the time, while the petrol engine is there to — mostly — charge up the little 1.69kWh battery. However, unlike the Nissan , the Jolion’s engine can chime in and power the front wheels directly when extra thrust is needed. However, for all the electric power on offer, the Jolion’s not very economical. On the official WLTP test, it returns 47mpg, which means that it’s likely going to be closer to 40mpg in real-world conditions, and possibly worse than that. Other cars in this segment do much better than that, not least the aged-but-still-game Toyota RAV4 . There’s no plug-in hybrid model, either. While the Haval Jolion’s styling might give British buyers reassurance that they’re buying something that looks familiar, make sure you read the fine print first — with that thirsty engine and that tiny boot, the Jolion is going to struggle to cash the cheques its bodywork has written.

https://www.carwow.co.uk/jaecoo/7,Jaecoo 7 Review & Prices,"£30,115",7/10,"There is a seemingly endless onslaught of new Chinese brands hitting UK shores at the moment, and Jaecoo is one which is expanding at a rapid rate. You may have never heard of it until now, but it already has 71 dealers nationwide and will have 130 by the end of 2025 . This is its first offering in the UK: the Jaecoo 7. You can think of it as a slightly left-field alternative to cars like the Hyundai Tucson and Volkswagen Tiguan . It’s a bit like taking someone out to a date at Nando’s - food snobs may turn their noses up at it, but once you’re in the food is tasty and it’s well-priced. If you who haven’t heard of Jaecoo, it’s part of a Chinese car maker called Chery. Chery has already launched the Omoda brand in the UK, which will be sold in dealerships alongside Jaecoo, and it sells almost as many cars worldwide as Tesla . Don’t therefore go thinking this is some small artisan manufacturer. The Jaecoo 7 is a pretty funky-looking thing with its boxy styling and bluff front end. It may not be quite as outlandish as a Peugeot 3008 , but it wouldn’t look out of place parked on a posh London street. This theme continues on the inside, where you find the 7 is quite nicely built. All the materials feel nice and plush, and quality on the whole is good aside from a couple of flimsy-feeling details - namely the column stalks and the interior door handles. Strangely, you get a different dashboard layout depending on which engine you choose, but the plug-in hybrid’s is the best because it moves the gear selector up to the steering column, freeing up space in the centre console for storage. Entry-level cars get a 13.2-inch touchscreen, rising to 14.8-inches in the range-topper, and it’s pretty easy to use. The menus are logically laid out and the screen itself is bright and responsive. It’s also paired with a 10.3-inch digital driver’s display which is easy to read and navigate, but it’s not as configurable as the system you get in Audis . Storage in the 7 is good. The glovebox is a decent size, you get a massive compartment under the armrest which can be cooled by the air conditioning and there’s a handy tray under the screen for your phone which comes with a wireless charger. Non-hybrid models get a clever slot under the centre console for a tissue box so you can pull them though a slot - ideal for managing those winter colds. Getting comfortable behind the wheel is easy thanks to the adjustment in the seats and steering wheel; even the tallest of drivers should be able to find their ideal driving position. What’s not so great is rear seat space. Headroom is good thanks to the 7’s boxy dimensions, but the kneeroom is a bit tight and the seats feel like they’re a bit too close to the floor. A Skoda Karoq is better for carrying people in the back seats. At least you do get an armrest with a couple of cupholders back there, and top-spec cars get heated rear seats as well. At 500 litres, the Jaecoo’s boot lags behind some key competitors. It’s 20 litres down on the Peugeot 3008, and the Hyundai Tucson can carry 620 litres. It’s about the same as the Nissan Qashqai though, falling just three litres short of that car. Once you hit the road the first thing you notice is the excellent visibility. You get a great view over the square bonnet, and there are no major blind spots behind you either. A standard-fit 360-degree camera system makes those tricky parking exercises less stressful. Around town it’s a little bit firm over bumps, with smaller imperfections causing the car to jitter around and larger potholes sending a thud through the cabin. It’s still quite pleasant to potter around in, even if a Volvo XC40 is more comfortable. There are two engines to choose from in the 7: a 1.5-litre petrol and a plug-in hybrid . The PHEV is the one to go for, because the standard petrol engine is quite noisy under acceleration and it feels a bit sluggish at times. The hybrid is smooth and quiet around town, and it’s much more powerful for motorway driving. At higher speeds the suspension does settle down nicely, and there’s not much in the way of wind or road noise to disturb the peace. All cars get adaptive cruise control as standard as well which is nice. Get out onto a country road and you’ll quickly realise that there’s not much fun to be had. The light steering which is welcome around town becomes vague as you try to push through corners, and there is a touch more body roll than you might like. A Ford Kuga is much more fun, but the Jaecoo 7 is comfortable as long as you just take it easy. If you’re after an SUV which is a bit different and offers great value for money, the Jaecoo 7 is a worthy contender. It may not be as good to drive as some alternatives, nor is it the most practical, but the chunky styling, posh interior and generous standard equipment may just be enough to sway you. Check out the latest Jaecoo 7 deals available through Carwow to see how much you can save on this new car, or check out all the latest and greatest SUVs on sale to find your ideal model. You can also browse a wide range of used cars with Carwow, as well as sell your current car for a great price."
https://www.carwow.co.uk/leapmotor/c10,Leapmotor C10 Review & Prices,"£36,500",Not found,"Leapmotor is a new brand in the UK, Chinese in origin but with the backing of the huge Stellantis Group of companies - the force behind Citroen, Peugeot, Fiat and Jeep among others. The C10 is the larger of its two launch models, sitting above the T03 city car - it’s a fully electric SUV aimed at people who might otherwise consider the likes of the Renault Scenic E-Tech , BYD Atto 3 or Tesla Model Y . Despite having a face that looks a bit like Marvin the Paranoid Android, the C10 doesn’t claim to have a brain the size of a planet - in fact, unlike the quite clever T03, it doesn’t really do anything special. Instead it’s hoping to appeal to you with a combination of good value, understated looks, and impressive interior space. The C10 certainly won’t stand out in a crowd, unlike some alternatives which seem made to be as eye-catching as possible. It’s quite minimal, with the front getting a flat-topped bar containing both headlights - mirrored in a lightbar at the rear. The sides are flat and featureless with pop-out doorhandles, and the alloy wheels have a simple design. The same is true of the interior, which has just as few physical switches as a Tesla Model Y. Leapmotor seems to have made everything out of the same colour plastic where possible, giving it a quite cohesive - if very monochrome - look. The centre console features two cupholders and a wireless charging pad beneath a huge 14.6-inch touchscreen, while there’s a further 10.3-inch screen for the driver information. Everything is controlled either through one of these screens or through the steering wheel controls, though there is an AI-powered voice assistant too. Passenger space in the Leapmotor C10 appears pretty generous with a wide, flat rear seat. ISOFIX points in both outer rear seats, wide-opening doors and big windows all point to this being quite a good car for those who need to fit child seats in the rear. There’s also a 435-litre boot, which is less impressive - it’s soundly beaten by the 545-litre Renault Scenic E-Tech and smashed into submission by the Tesla Model Y and its vast 854-litre space. It’s more on par with the BYD Atto 3, which gets 440 litres of room. There’s just one electric motor and battery combination available in the Leapmotor C10. It’s a 218hp motor, driving the rear wheels, and offering up to 262 miles of range in official tests. Those figures aren’t really that impressive - in fact, they’re almost identical to the BYD Atto 3, though that uses a smaller battery. The Scenic E-Tech gets 260 miles from its small-battery option, but also has a long-range model offering up to 379 miles, while the Tesla Model Y can go up to 311 miles. We’ve not yet driven the Leapmotor C10, but bookmark this page to make sure you can read our full review when we do. Interested in the Leapmotor C10?

https://www.carwow.co.uk/leapmotor/t03,Leapmotor T03 Review & Prices,"£15,995",6/10,"While tiny, cheap electric cars have really caught on in some markets, they haven’t so much in the UK - and most popular electric cars sold here are larger and relatively posh. But Leapmotor thinks the bottom of the market is worth a try - so it’s having a go with this, the tiny Leapmotor T03. If you’ve never heard of Leapmotor, don’t worry. It’s a new brand to the UK, and is Chinese in origin - but its European operations are half-owned by the giant Stellantis manufacturing group that also operates Citroen , Peugeot , Fiat and many others, so Leapmotor has a ready-made network of dealers and service centres. It’s like buying a TV from a supermarket - you might not have heard of the brand before, but you can at least be confident there’s a warranty behind it and somewhere to return it to if things go wrong. With the T03’s dinky dimensions and low price tag, there’s only really one car it’s taking aim at - the Dacia Spring . Leapmotor’s offering is a bit more expensive than a basic Spring, but has more range and greater equipment levels to make up for it. The T03 could also be a credible alternative to a used version of a larger EV - it’s pretty comparable to a one-year-old Vauxhall Corsa Electric or MG4 EV . Range: 165 miles Efficiency: 4.4 mi/kWh Battery size: 37.3kWh Max charge speed: 48kW Charge time AC: 6hrs 0-100% (6.6kW) Charge time DC: 36 mins 30-80% (48kW) Charge port location: Front centre Power outputs: 95hp The T03’s styling stands out from more aggressive-looking alternatives. It looks like an anime character with headlights that look like friendly eyes and a small, smiley grille. Its body is tall and narrow, like a Japanese kei car, and sits on tiny 13-inch wheels. It feels a bit like an electric Fiat Panda, reimagined for 2025. That tall body has an advantage when it comes to passenger room - the T03 has an impressive amount of space, and four six-foot adults can get surprisingly comfortable inside. It’s far too narrow to accommodate three across the rear bench, though, and even two burly adults might find the front seats to be a bit snug. Plus, all that room for people means the boot is a dinky 210 litres in capacity - smaller than the Dacia Spring’s. The T03’s simple dashboard design feels much more like a ‘proper’ car than the Dacia’s, and all models get a crisp and clear 10.1-inch central touchscreen and an 8.0-inch driver’s instrument display. Those two come at the expense of almost all physical controls, even a volume dial - and annoyingly, the infotainment software isn’t clever or responsive enough to make you forget or forgive this. Plus, you don’t get Apple CarPlay or Android Auto , which is very frustrating. Interior quality is very good for the price tag otherwise, making the lack of software finesse even more irritating. To drive, the T03 feels nippy around town - with 95hp, it’s much more powerful than the Dacia Spring or equivalent petrol-fuelled city cars, and that reflects in a feeling of urgency when you put your foot down. It’s not totally outclassed on the motorway either, though the tall body and tiny, narrow tyres soon kibosh any thoughts of enjoying yourself on a twisty back road. With a small 37.3kWh battery pack, range is an official 165 miles - though that’s reduced greatly if you do lots of motorway driving. Charge speeds are modest, too, and reflect that this is likely to be a second car charged up at home rather than a main vehicle undertaking lots of long journeys.

https://www.carwow.co.uk/xpeng/g6,Xpeng G6 Review & Prices,"£40,000",8/10,"The Xpeng G6 is the latest Chinese electric car vying for your attention, and it’s well worthy of it. Xpeng was only founded in 2014 and the G6 launched in China in 2023 - but it’s now made its way to the UK as a mid-sized alternative to the Tesla Model Y , the Hyundai Ioniq 5 , and the Skoda Enyaq . With its smooth silhouette, button-free interior design and oodles of clever tech, it’s definitely the Tesla that Xpeng is most obviously gunning for. If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, then Elon Musk should be tickled pink by the G6’s existence. But don’t go thinking the G6 is just a copycat clone - in fact, it’s a surprisingly mature and well-sorted electric car. Chinese cars often offer great value but are rough around the edges, but that’s not the case with the Xpeng. Range: 270-354 miles Efficiency: 4.0 miles per kWh Battery size: 66kWh/87.5kWh Max charge speed: 215kW/280kW Charge time AC: 7.5-9.5hrs (11kW) Charge time DC: 20mins 10-80% Charge port location: Right rear Power outputs: 255-282bhp In terms of styling, there’s nothing to get too excited about - but nor is there any reason to have a moan. The G6 has smooth sides with flush door handles, a wide lightbar on the front above low-set headlights, and a flat, fairly featureless rear. The alloy wheels look smart and one nice touch is a rear windscreen wiper - something many electric cars of this shape don’t offer. Inside, it’s similarly minimalist. Physical switchgear is limited to the steering wheel, the window switches and the Mercedes -aping column stalks - that’s it. The remainder of your interaction goes through the massive 15.0-inch central touchscreen - though unlike the Tesla Model Y, you also get a driver display with your speed and other essentials on it. In contrast to many Chinese car infotainment systems, the Xpeng’s feels as slick as any Western manufacturer’s. The menus are quick to respond, sensibly laid out and easy to navigate - and that’s no mean feat given the level of gadgetry fitted. Interior quality is pretty good, and it’s roomy too - there’s loads of space in the back, even for three occupants, and the boot is a decent size even if it’s not up to the cavernous area you get in the Tesla Model Y. The rear seats can recline, and the whole affair can even fold flat for in-car camping with an optional mattress accessory. There are special camping modes for the infotainment and air-con to facilitate this. Xpeng hasn’t made the G6 stupidly powerful, nor does it baffle with too much choice. There are two versions - the Standard Range car gets 255hp and can do 270 miles to a charge, while the Long Range has 282hp and is capable of 354 miles between topups. Both are quick without being rabid, but you’re not too encouraged to drive the G6 fast because it’s not especially fun. The steering feels quite disconnected from the front wheels, with very little feedback, and the suspension never really settles into a rhythm. It’s not the harshest-riding car out there, but a Hyundai Ioniq 5 deals better with bumps. However, the Xpeng G6’s strong combination of space, value and range makes it a seriously compelling alternative to the established EV roster. If you’re interested, you can check out our best Xpeng G6 deals , or see other brilliant deals on electric cars . Remember that Carwow can even help you to sell your old car when the time comes."
