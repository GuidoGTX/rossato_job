         "The MG3 used to be a bit of a joke - the old one was the lowest-ranked car on Carwow - but the new model aims to change all that. Now, instead of being antiquated, it’s right up there with the best small cars for performance, efficiency and equipment. Like an air fryer from the middle of Lidl, the MG3’s feature set is as good as any of its alternatives and it’s not immediately clear where the money’s been saved to bring it in at such a low price. Now that it’s a full self-charging hybrid car , the MG3 no longer targets the very cheapest on the market like the Dacia Sandero or Citroen C3 Origin . Instead, it’s more like a cut-price alternative to the Renault Clio E-Tech or Toyota Yaris - a halfway house for people who want the most efficient small car possible, but either don’t want or can’t have a fully electric model. The MG3 won’t win awards for its practicality - it’s not cramped, but it’s no better than average in this regard with a boot that’s about halfway between the Yaris and the Clio in capacity. Rear seat space is moderate, too, though annoyingly the rear seats don’t split when they fold which does limit overall versatility. The front of the cabin looks great, and very modern - in stark contrast to the car it replaces. Poke around and you can find a few places where MG’s saved money - there’s a sliding cover for one of the storage compartments that feels comically flimsy, and the top of the dash and the door cards are made of hard plastic - but the Clio and the Yaris have areas that feel equally cheap. More importantly, MG’s given the 3 its best touchscreen infotainment system yet, and it’s loaded with equipment - climate control, a digital dashboard, sat-nav and a full suite of assisted driving features are standard on every model. The MG’s hybrid system is brand-new, and puts out an impressive 191hp - versus 140hp for the Clio and up to 130hp for the Yaris. That means it’s easily got any of them beat in a drag race, and makes mincemeat of overtakes or motorway sliproads. It’s not quite as efficient as the alternatives, but you might decide that the additional performance makes the small drop in mpg worthwhile. The real surprise is what happens when you reach a twisty road. The old MG3 was always shockingly good fun in the corners, but unexpectedly MG has managed to repeat the trick. The new MG3 handles brilliantly for a small car, and that makes it one of the most enjoyable small cars to drive. Sound interesting? Check here for our best MG3 deals , or look for a used MG3 on Carwow here. You could also check out other used MGs here, and remember that Carwow can even help you sell your car online too."

         "MG HS Review & Prices",
         "£25,995",
         "8/10",
         "The MG HS has at points been the best-selling car in the UK and it’s easy to see why. It’s a big, practical family SUV with a posh-looking interior, loads of standard equipment and a headline-grabbing plug-in hybrid engine option - but it costs about as much as most small hatchbacks . While the old HS was definitely in the ‘cheap but not very cheerful’ category, the new model actually feels like something you wouldn’t mind driving around - it has redeeming features other than its price tag. It’s a bit like a Harvester - nobody’s ever going to look at it as a high-end option, but if you’re looking to feed the whole family on a budget, it’s tasty enough that you don’t feel punished for your penny-pinching. The HS is a similar size to family SUVs such as the Ford Kuga , Kia Sportage and Nissan Qashqai - but with its low price tag, you might consider it on the same shortlist as much smaller SUVs such as the Volkswagen T-Cross or Ford Puma . Two more direct alternatives are the Citroen C5 Aircross or BYD Seal U - both big SUVs that put affordability first, and have plug-in hybrid engines available. If your main concern is space for the money, the MG HS is a great option. Despite a price tag close to something like a Volkswagen Polo hatchback, it has space in the back for a six-foot adult to stretch out, plus a 507-litre boot that’ll accommodate the whole family’s kit and clobber. You also get a dashboard that looks pretty posh, with a dual-screen setup just like you get on a BMW X3 . You don’t have to press very far to find out where MG’s saved money, though, and materials and build quality aren’t really up to the standards of more expensive cars. It’s also not the easiest to use, with very few physical switches, an awkward touchscreen interface and not much storage for smaller items. As far as engines go, there’s a choice of two. You can have a bog-standard petrol, available with manual or automatic gearboxes - these are the more affordable options, and though they’re not particularly offensive to drive they are a bit thirsty. The headline-grabber is the HS plug-in hybrid, which can do up to 75 miles on a charge. That figure is up there with the best PHEVs on sale, and it gives you tons of flexibility - it’s enough to do even the longest of commutes without troubling the petrol engine once. It also nudges the HS into the lowest-but-one band for Benefit-in-Kind tax, making it hundreds of pounds a month cheaper than the equivalent Kia Sportage or Ford Kuga for company car drivers. Both of those cars are better to drive, mind you - they steer more sweetly and handle bumps better, as well as being more responsive and reassuring in the corners. The gap is narrower if you’re just cruising round town or on the motorway, though, where the HS is impressively refined and difficult to dislike. If the new MG HS seems like the SUV for you, check out our best MG HS deals on Carwow. You can see our other MG deals here, or search for a used MG for sale here. And remember, Carwow can even help you sell your old car ."

         "MG Cyberster Review & Prices",
         "£54,995",
         "7/10",
         "The MG Cyberster is, arguably, the first drop-top electric sports car . It joins a vanishingly small cohort of electric convertibles that includes the short-lived Mini Electric Convertible , colossally expensive Maserati GranCabrio Folgore and the hardly-a-convertible Fiat 500e Cabrio plus its Abarth sibling. The Cyberster represents the meeting of MG’s past and future. The brand’s history is in building convertible sports cars, but the last few years have been all about electrification. It’s like a Silver Cross buggy - inspired by the baby carriages of the past but definitely a product of the present with all the modern features buyers expect. MG’s also been sure to include a few features that nobody was expecting - hardcore MG fans or otherwise. The Cyberster looks like nothing else on the road, with insectoid headlights, squat proportions that make it look quite a lot smaller than it is and a wild rear featuring arrow-shaped taillights and a full-width lightbar. The wow factor increases with the doors, which are electrically-operated scissor doors that open up and away rather than outwards. It’s fair to say that if you arrive somewhere in a Cyberster, you’re guaranteed to make an entrance whether you want to or not - in fact, get used to being stopped in car parks, or having people’s heads turn in traffic. The flip side is that you can’t really arrive anywhere discreetly - and those party piece doors can be frustratingly slow to operate. The interior isn’t short of issues either, most of which come from its eye-catching quadruple-screen layout. That’s right - four screens, with three pivoted towards the driver and a fourth in the centre console for climate controls. Range: 276 miles / 316 miles Efficiency: 3.3-3.7mi/kWh Battery size: 77kWh Max charge speed: 144kW Charge time AC: 10hrs 30mins, 10-100%, 7kW Charge time DC: 38mins, 10-80%, 144kW Charge port location: Left side rear Power outputs: 340hp / 510hp If it sounds confusing, that’s because it is - the outer screens are constantly blocked by the steering wheel, and it’s never particularly clear which functions you control via which screen. At least the driver’s display is clear and concise. The rest of the interior is largely successful. It’s roomy enough, and storage consists of a glovebox, a big shelf behind the seats useful for bags or coats, tiny door bins and a couple of cubbies in the centre console. Material quality is excellent, and build quality isn’t too bad either - not up to the standards of a Porsche , but then the Cyberster makes even the petrol-engined Porsche Boxster look like a bargain. One potential issue rears its ugly head for tall drivers, though, as the seats are set very high. You never really feel as if you’re sat ‘in’ the Cyberster - more like you’re perched on top of it - and if you’re over six feet tall or have a long torso you may find your head brushing the roof. The roof, incidentally, is an electrically-operated fabric affair. It goes down swiftly and can be operated at speeds up to 28mph, which is really useful if you’re hit by a sudden rainstorm, and when it’s up it does a good job of keeping the heat in and the noise out. Not that there’s much noise to be heard. It’s quite disconcerting being in a convertible car that makes nothing more than a soft whirr on acceleration. Like most electric cars, the Cyberster is swift - even the basic rear-wheel drive model will give hot hatchbacks a run for their money, while the fastest dual-motor version has supercar pace. Despite this, it doesn’t feel sporty to drive. The Cyberster is comfortable, quiet and reasonably relaxing, but if you push it into a set of corners you soon feel that it’s a very heavy car with relatively uncommunicative steering. Despite appearances, it’s more of a boulevard cruiser than an out-and-out sports car. You’ll even be able to cruise for a decent distance, with an official range figure of more than 300 miles in the entry-level car. As a package, there’s a lot to love about the MG Cyberster. It’s not a pedigree performance car, but if you’re looking for a drop-top cruiser it does a fantastic job of being comfortable, offering punchy performance when you need it, and feeling largely high quality inside. Find out how much you can save with Carwow’s MG Cyberster deals , or get a great price on other MG models . You can also browse the latest used MGs from out network of trusted dealers, and when the time comes, you can sell your car online on Carwow, too."

         "MG ZS Review & Prices",
         "£18,605",
         "5/10",
         "If you’re looking for a small family SUV that’s practical, affordable and reasonably well-equipped, the MG ZS is well worth considering. Okay, it might not feel quite as upmarket as the likes of the Mazda CX-3 but it’s significantly cheaper to buy and much roomier inside. The standard fabric seats come with enough adjustment to get comfortable and the buttons you’ll regularly use are easy to reach and laid out in a logical, uncluttered fashion. Both the Excite and Exclusive trims come with a 10.1-inch colour touchscreen as standard for the infotainment system. You get Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and the Exclusive also has integrated sat nav. The MG’s system is easy to use and responds quickly to your finger on the screen, but some of the menus can be tricky to go back a page, so it’s not quite as intuitive to use as that in a Ford Puma . The back seats don’t get so many nice touches. Although you’ll find there’s much more headroom and legroom than in a Renault Captur , Mazda CX-3 or Nissan Juke , there are no cupholders or centre rear armrest. The 448-litre boot’s roomy too – it’s more than 90 litres larger than the Mazda (350 litres), and 26 litres more than both the Renault or Nissan (422 litres). It's more than big enough to carry a large baby buggy and some big soft bags at once. Flip the back seats down and there’s just enough space to carry a bike with its wheels attached. You can get the ZS with two petrol engines. Pick the 1.0-litre turbo petrol if you spend lots of time driving around town or the 1.5-litre petrol model if you do lots of motorway miles. Both are relatively quiet – if not particularly quick – and will return around 35mpg in normal conditions compared to MG’s claimed 44.9mpg and 49.6mpg respectively. There's also the MG ZS EV - one of the most affordable electric SUVs on sale - that we've reviewed separately. Here we're focused purely on the petrol model. Whichever engine you pick, the ZS is easy to drive thanks to its adjustable steering that provides extra assistance at slow speeds. Unfortunately, the view out the back isn’t great, which can make squeezing into tight parking spaces a bit tricky – but at least rear parking sensors as standard. You even get cruise control on all models to help make long drives a bit more relaxing. Unfortunately, the ZS is quite noisy at motorway speeds and you’ll hear quite a bit more wind and tyre noise than in the likes of the Mazda, and it isn’t as comfortable over bumpy roads as the Citroen C3 Aircross. Unlike these alternatives, the MG doesn’t come with the option of automatic emergency braking to help stop the car quickly if it senses an obstacle ahead. As a result, it has only managed a three-start score from Euro NCAP . If this isn’t a dealbreaker for you, the MG ZS makes a strong case for itself as an affordable, yet spacious, small family car. Avoid the rather spartan entry-level models and it’s an SUV that’s well worth considering. Should the MG ZS be the car for you, make sure you check out our latest MG ZS deals and browse our used MG ZS models. You can also look through other used MGs to find out how much you could save when buying through carwow. You can also sell your car through carwow, where our dealers will bid on your car to get you the best price."

         "£26,995",
         "8/10",
         "MG pulled an absolute blinder with the MG4, and much like the lovable underdog in a boxing movie it punches well above its weight division. It’s more affordable than alternatives such as the Renault Megane E-Tech and Cupra Born , costing around the same as the smaller Vauxhall Corsa Electric and Fiat 500e . You’d be forgiven for thinking that MG have taken a ‘cheap and cheerful’ approach to engineering the MG4, but that’s far from the truth. So far from it, in fact, that the MG4 received high commendations in the 2024 Carwow Car of the Year Awards’ Outstanding EV and Urban Living categories. Just look at it, a mix of pointy details, sharp creases and funky shapes such as the lower body cladding and split roof spoiler. It’s a refreshing looking thing; it still stands out against newer MGs such as the MG S5 and MG HS as much as it does its alternatives. Range: 218-331 miles Efficiency: 3.6-3.8 miles per kWh Battery size: 51kWh / 62kWh / 74kWh Max charge speed: 150kW Charge time AC: 6hrs 12mins, 10-100%, 7kW / 7hrs 30mins, 10-100%, 7kW / 9hrs, 10-100%, 7kW Charge time DC: 39mins, 10-80%, 150kW / 35mins, 10-80%, 150kW Charge port location: Left rear Power outputs: 170hp / 204hp / 245hp It’s a shame the interior isn’t quite as novel, with a dashboard layout that’s so simple it verges on boring, but the material quality, fit and finish and standard kit is better than you might expect for the price. A 10.25-inch infotainment display comes as standard on all trim levels of the MG4, and though it comes with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, MG’s own software is rather basic. It’s frustrating to operate too, especially on the move, with too many menus to navigate. There’s plenty of room in the MG4 though; plenty of adjustability for you to get comfy behind the wheel and enough head and leg room for tall passengers in the rear - though it’s a bit of a squeeze when you’ve got three in the back. The 363-litre boot capacity trails the Volkswagen ID3 for space, and puts it well behind the Megane E-Tech. The MG4 comes with two battery options, offering 218 claimed miles of range in its most basic trim through to 323 miles for the Trophy Extended Range model. The top-rung MG4 XPower , which we’ve reviewed separately, offers a big power hike over the rest of the trim levels, but makes do with a 239-mile range. Around town the MG4 is easy to potter about in thanks to its light steering, peppy electric motors and most importantly, its comfortable suspension. It takes potholes, speed bumps and cracked roads in its stride, and the same applies to motorways where the MG4 just soaks up the miles with ease. Yet even with its soft suspension the MG4 is rather fun to drive on a twisty road, feeling agile and grippy with little in the way of body lean. The X-Power is particularly rapid, but it’s different enough that we've reviewed it separately here. For a stonking value for money proposition, have a look at our new MG4 deals as well as our MG4 lease deals . You can also check out used MG4s from our network of trusted dealers as well as other used MGs . When it’s time for a change, you can even sell your current car through Carwow."

         "The MG3 used to be a bit of a joke - the old one was the lowest-ranked car on Carwow - but the new model aims to change all that. Now, instead of being antiquated, it’s right up there with the best small cars for performance, efficiency and equipment. Like an air fryer from the middle of Lidl, the MG3’s feature set is as good as any of its alternatives and it’s not immediately clear where the money’s been saved to bring it in at such a low price. Now that it’s a full self-charging hybrid car , the MG3 no longer targets the very cheapest on the market like the Dacia Sandero or Citroen C3 Origin . Instead, it’s more like a cut-price alternative to the Renault Clio E-Tech or Toyota Yaris - a halfway house for people who want the most efficient small car possible, but either don’t want or can’t have a fully electric model. The MG3 won’t win awards for its practicality - it’s not cramped, but it’s no better than average in this regard with a boot that’s about halfway between the Yaris and the Clio in capacity. Rear seat space is moderate, too, though annoyingly the rear seats don’t split when they fold which does limit overall versatility. The front of the cabin looks great, and very modern - in stark contrast to the car it replaces. Poke around and you can find a few places where MG’s saved money - there’s a sliding cover for one of the storage compartments that feels comically flimsy, and the top of the dash and the door cards are made of hard plastic - but the Clio and the Yaris have areas that feel equally cheap. More importantly, MG’s given the 3 its best touchscreen infotainment system yet, and it’s loaded with equipment - climate control, a digital dashboard, sat-nav and a full suite of assisted driving features are standard on every model. The MG’s hybrid system is brand-new, and puts out an impressive 191hp - versus 140hp for the Clio and up to 130hp for the Yaris. That means it’s easily got any of them beat in a drag race, and makes mincemeat of overtakes or motorway sliproads. It’s not quite as efficient as the alternatives, but you might decide that the additional performance makes the small drop in mpg worthwhile. The real surprise is what happens when you reach a twisty road. The old MG3 was always shockingly good fun in the corners, but unexpectedly MG has managed to repeat the trick. The new MG3 handles brilliantly for a small car, and that makes it one of the most enjoyable small cars to drive. Sound interesting? Check here for our best MG3 deals , or look for a used MG3 on Carwow here. You could also check out other used MGs here, and remember that Carwow can even help you sell your car online too."

       " 'https://www.carwow.co.uk/mg/hs, MG HS Review & Prices, £25,995, 8/10, The MG HS has at points been the best-selling car in the UK and it’s easy to see why. It’s a big, practical family SUV with a posh-looking interior, loads of standard equipment and a headline-grabbing plug-in hybrid engine option - but it costs about as much as most small hatchbacks . While the old HS was definitely in the ‘cheap but not very cheerful’ category, the new model actually feels like something you wouldn’t mind driving around - it has redeeming features other than its price tag. It’s a bit like a Harvester - nobody’s ever going to look at it as a high-end option, but if you’re looking to feed the whole family on a budget, it’s tasty enough that you don’t feel punished for your penny-pinching. The HS is a similar size to family SUVs such as the Ford Kuga , Kia Sportage and Nissan Qashqai - but with its low price tag, you might consider it on the same shortlist as much smaller SUVs such as the Volkswagen T-Cross or Ford Puma . Two more direct alternatives are the Citroen C5 Aircross or BYD Seal U - both big SUVs that put affordability first, and have plug-in hybrid engines available. If your main concern is space for the money, the MG HS is a great option. Despite a price tag close to something like a Volkswagen Polo hatchback, it has space in the back for a six-foot adult to stretch out, plus a 507-litre boot that’ll accommodate the whole family’s kit and clobber. You also get a dashboard that looks pretty posh, with a dual-screen setup just like you get on a BMW X3 . You don’t have to press very far to find out where MG’s saved money, though, and materials and build quality aren’t really up to the standards of more expensive cars. It’s also not the easiest to use, with very few physical switches, an awkward touchscreen interface and not much storage for smaller items. As far as engines go, there’s a choice of two. You can have a bog-standard petrol, available with manual or automatic gearboxes - these are the more affordable options, and though they’re not particularly offensive to drive they are a bit thirsty. The headline-grabber is the HS plug-in hybrid, which can do up to 75 miles on a charge. That figure is up there with the best PHEVs on sale, and it gives you tons of flexibility - it’s enough to do even the longest of commutes without troubling the petrol engine once. It also nudges the HS into the lowest-but-one band for Benefit-in-Kind tax, making it hundreds of pounds a month cheaper than the equivalent Kia Sportage or Ford Kuga for company car drivers. Both of those cars are better to drive, mind you - they steer more sweetly and handle bumps better, as well as being more responsive and reassuring in the corners. The gap is narrower if you’re just cruising round town or on the motorway, though, where the HS is impressively refined and difficult to dislike. If the new MG HS seems like the SUV for you, check out our best MG HS deals on Carwow. You can see our other MG deals here, or search for a used MG for sale here. And remember, Carwow can even help you sell your old car .',\n",
       " 'https://www.carwow.co.uk/mg/cyberster, MG Cyberster Review & Prices, £54,995, 7/10, The MG Cyberster is, arguably, the first drop-top electric sports car . It joins a vanishingly small cohort of electric convertibles that includes the short-lived Mini Electric Convertible , colossally expensive Maserati GranCabrio Folgore and the hardly-a-convertible Fiat 500e Cabrio plus its Abarth sibling. The Cyberster represents the meeting of MG’s past and future. The brand’s history is in building convertible sports cars, but the last few years have been all about electrification. It’s like a Silver Cross buggy - inspired by the baby carriages of the past but definitely a product of the present with all the modern features buyers expect. MG’s also been sure to include a few features that nobody was expecting - hardcore MG fans or otherwise. The Cyberster looks like nothing else on the road, with insectoid headlights, squat proportions that make it look quite a lot smaller than it is and a wild rear featuring arrow-shaped taillights and a full-width lightbar. The wow factor increases with the doors, which are electrically-operated scissor doors that open up and away rather than outwards. It’s fair to say that if you arrive somewhere in a Cyberster, you’re guaranteed to make an entrance whether you want to or not - in fact, get used to being stopped in car parks, or having people’s heads turn in traffic. The flip side is that you can’t really arrive anywhere discreetly - and those party piece doors can be frustratingly slow to operate. The interior isn’t short of issues either, most of which come from its eye-catching quadruple-screen layout. That’s right - four screens, with three pivoted towards the driver and a fourth in the centre console for climate controls. Range: 276 miles / 316 miles Efficiency: 3.3-3.7mi/kWh Battery size: 77kWh Max charge speed: 144kW Charge time AC: 10hrs 30mins, 10-100%, 7kW Charge time DC: 38mins, 10-80%, 144kW Charge port location: Left side rear Power outputs: 340hp / 510hp If it sounds confusing, that’s because it is - the outer screens are constantly blocked by the steering wheel, and it’s never particularly clear which functions you control via which screen. At least the driver’s display is clear and concise. The rest of the interior is largely successful. It’s roomy enough, and storage consists of a glovebox, a big shelf behind the seats useful for bags or coats, tiny door bins and a couple of cubbies in the centre console. Material quality is excellent, and build quality isn’t too bad either - not up to the standards of a Porsche , but then the Cyberster makes even the petrol-engined Porsche Boxster look like a bargain. One potential issue rears its ugly head for tall drivers, though, as the seats are set very high. You never really feel as if you’re sat ‘in’ the Cyberster - more like you’re perched on top of it - and if you’re over six feet tall or have a long torso you may find your head brushing the roof. The roof, incidentally, is an electrically-operated fabric affair. It goes down swiftly and can be operated at speeds up to 28mph, which is really useful if you’re hit by a sudden rainstorm, and when it’s up it does a good job of keeping the heat in and the noise out. Not that there’s much noise to be heard. It’s quite disconcerting being in a convertible car that makes nothing more than a soft whirr on acceleration. Like most electric cars, the Cyberster is swift - even the basic rear-wheel drive model will give hot hatchbacks a run for their money, while the fastest dual-motor version has supercar pace. Despite this, it doesn’t feel sporty to drive. The Cyberster is comfortable, quiet and reasonably relaxing, but if you push it into a set of corners you soon feel that it’s a very heavy car with relatively uncommunicative steering. Despite appearances, it’s more of a boulevard cruiser than an out-and-out sports car. You’ll even be able to cruise for a decent distance, with an official range figure of more than 300 miles in the entry-level car. As a package, there’s a lot to love about the MG Cyberster. It’s not a pedigree performance car, but if you’re looking for a drop-top cruiser it does a fantastic job of being comfortable, offering punchy performance when you need it, and feeling largely high quality inside. Find out how much you can save with Carwow’s MG Cyberster deals , or get a great price on other MG models . You can also browse the latest used MGs from out network of trusted dealers, and when the time comes, you can sell your car online on Carwow, too.',\n",
       " \"https://www.carwow.co.uk/mg/zs/2018, MG ZS Review & Prices, £18,605, 5/10, If you’re looking for a small family SUV that’s practical, affordable and reasonably well-equipped, the MG ZS is well worth considering. Okay, it might not feel quite as upmarket as the likes of the Mazda CX-3 but it’s significantly cheaper to buy and much roomier inside. The standard fabric seats come with enough adjustment to get comfortable and the buttons you’ll regularly use are easy to reach and laid out in a logical, uncluttered fashion. Both the Excite and Exclusive trims come with a 10.1-inch colour touchscreen as standard for the infotainment system. You get Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and the Exclusive also has integrated sat nav. The MG’s system is easy to use and responds quickly to your finger on the screen, but some of the menus can be tricky to go back a page, so it’s not quite as intuitive to use as that in a Ford Puma . The back seats don’t get so many nice touches. Although you’ll find there’s much more headroom and legroom than in a Renault Captur , Mazda CX-3 or Nissan Juke , there are no cupholders or centre rear armrest. The 448-litre boot’s roomy too – it’s more than 90 litres larger than the Mazda (350 litres), and 26 litres more than both the Renault or Nissan (422 litres). It's more than big enough to carry a large baby buggy and some big soft bags at once. Flip the back seats down and there’s just enough space to carry a bike with its wheels attached. You can get the ZS with two petrol engines. Pick the 1.0-litre turbo petrol if you spend lots of time driving around town or the 1.5-litre petrol model if you do lots of motorway miles. Both are relatively quiet – if not particularly quick – and will return around 35mpg in normal conditions compared to MG’s claimed 44.9mpg and 49.6mpg respectively. There's also the MG ZS EV - one of the most affordable electric SUVs on sale - that we've reviewed separately. Here we're focused purely on the petrol model. Whichever engine you pick, the ZS is easy to drive thanks to its adjustable steering that provides extra assistance at slow speeds. Unfortunately, the view out the back isn’t great, which can make squeezing into tight parking spaces a bit tricky – but at least rear parking sensors as standard. You even get cruise control on all models to help make long drives a bit more relaxing. Unfortunately, the ZS is quite noisy at motorway speeds and you’ll hear quite a bit more wind and tyre noise than in the likes of the Mazda, and it isn’t as comfortable over bumpy roads as the Citroen C3 Aircross. Unlike these alternatives, the MG doesn’t come with the option of automatic emergency braking to help stop the car quickly if it senses an obstacle ahead. As a result, it has only managed a three-start score from Euro NCAP . If this isn’t a dealbreaker for you, the MG ZS makes a strong case for itself as an affordable, yet spacious, small family car. Avoid the rather spartan entry-level models and it’s an SUV that’s well worth considering. Should the MG ZS be the car for you, make sure you check out our latest MG ZS deals and browse our used MG ZS models. You can also look through other used MGs to find out how much you could save when buying through carwow. You can also sell your car through carwow, where our dealers will bid on your car to get you the best price.\",\n",
       " \"https://www.carwow.co.uk/mg/mg-4, MG4 EV REVIEW & PRICES, £26,995, 8/10, MG pulled an absolute blinder with the MG4, and much like the lovable underdog in a boxing movie it punches well above its weight division. It’s more affordable than alternatives such as the Renault Megane E-Tech and Cupra Born , costing around the same as the smaller Vauxhall Corsa Electric and Fiat 500e . You’d be forgiven for thinking that MG have taken a ‘cheap and cheerful’ approach to engineering the MG4, but that’s far from the truth. So far from it, in fact, that the MG4 received high commendations in the 2024 Carwow Car of the Year Awards’ Outstanding EV and Urban Living categories. Just look at it, a mix of pointy details, sharp creases and funky shapes such as the lower body cladding and split roof spoiler. It’s a refreshing looking thing; it still stands out against newer MGs such as the MG S5 and MG HS as much as it does its alternatives. Range: 218-331 miles Efficiency: 3.6-3.8 miles per kWh Battery size: 51kWh / 62kWh / 74kWh Max charge speed: 150kW Charge time AC: 6hrs 12mins, 10-100%, 7kW / 7hrs 30mins, 10-100%, 7kW / 9hrs, 10-100%, 7kW Charge time DC: 39mins, 10-80%, 150kW / 35mins, 10-80%, 150kW Charge port location: Left rear Power outputs: 170hp / 204hp / 245hp It’s a shame the interior isn’t quite as novel, with a dashboard layout that’s so simple it verges on boring, but the material quality, fit and finish and standard kit is better than you might expect for the price. A 10.25-inch infotainment display comes as standard on all trim levels of the MG4, and though it comes with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, MG’s own software is rather basic. It’s frustrating to operate too, especially on the move, with too many menus to navigate. There’s plenty of room in the MG4 though; plenty of adjustability for you to get comfy behind the wheel and enough head and leg room for tall passengers in the rear - though it’s a bit of a squeeze when you’ve got three in the back. The 363-litre boot capacity trails the Volkswagen ID3 for space, and puts it well behind the Megane E-Tech. The MG4 comes with two battery options, offering 218 claimed miles of range in its most basic trim through to 323 miles for the Trophy Extended Range model. The top-rung MG4 XPower , which we’ve reviewed separately, offers a big power hike over the rest of the trim levels, but makes do with a 239-mile range. Around town the MG4 is easy to potter about in thanks to its light steering, peppy electric motors and most importantly, its comfortable suspension. It takes potholes, speed bumps and cracked roads in its stride, and the same applies to motorways where the MG4 just soaks up the miles with ease. Yet even with its soft suspension the MG4 is rather fun to drive on a twisty road, feeling agile and grippy with little in the way of body lean. The X-Power is particularly rapid, but it’s different enough that we've reviewed it separately here. For a stonking value for money proposition, have a look at our new MG4 deals as well as our MG4 lease deals . You can also check out used MG4s from our network of trusted dealers as well as other used MGs . When it’s time for a change, you can even sell your current car through Carwow.\"]"
