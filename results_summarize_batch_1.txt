Its exterior design is a bit basic, with plastic bumper trims and a curvy roofline, but it boasts a sporty appearance. The interior is surprisingly well-organized, though the plastic finishes feel cheap, and the optional brushed metal trim lacks the robustness of the rest.

“The MG HS has consistently been a top-selling car in the UK, and its practical family SUV design is highly praised. It boasts a posh interior, ample standard equipment, and a captivating plug-in hybrid engine option, though it carries a significant price tag.

The HS plugin hybrid provides up to 75 miles of electric range, offering flexibility and mitigating the need for petrol. It's surprisingly smooth and responsive, navigating tighter corners and roads well. Though the steering can be a bit heavy, the HS's low-slung profile offers a comfortable ride.  Visibility is a concern with the chunky front pillars, and the rear visibility can be slightly limited. The interior design is modern and high-quality, but the software is a bit clunky, requiring a lot of button-pushing.  The PHEV delivers impressive power and range, with official figures exceeding 672.6mpg, which is substantially higher than any equivalent petrol SUV.

“The Volkswagen Golf GTI offers a compelling blend of performance and practicality, delivering a surprisingly engaging driving experience for its class. While it shares some similarities with established hot hatch competitors, like the Honda Civic Type R and Toyota GR Yaris, the Golf GTI distinguishes itself with its more direct steering and engaging handling.

The GTI’s turbocharged engine delivers 265hp in the standard model and 300hp in the Clubsport, generating 060mph in 5.4 seconds.  Fuel efficiency is respectable, achieving around 39.8mpg in the standard version and 37.7mpg in the Clubsport.

If you prioritize engaging handling and a slightly more visceral driving experience than outright speed, the Golf GTI remains an excellent choice.”

The electric steering is light and easy to use, though the slightly slow response can be frustrating in city driving.  The ride is comfortable and absorbs road imperfections well, but potholes and bumps are noticeable.

The infotainment system is a highlight, offering sharp graphics and easy access to features. However, the touchscreen controls can be finicky, and the augmented reality head-up display is useful but slightly intrusive.

The ID5’s interior feels a bit cheap, with hard plastics prevalent.  The boot space is decent for a family, offering 549 litres, slightly smaller than the ID4. The low-slung roofline compromises headroom, especially for taller passengers.  

Performance is adequate for daily driving, but the ID5 doesn't feel particularly exciting on the motorway.  It’s a comfortable, family-friendly SUV that’s a good option for longer journeys, but those looking for sporty driving will find it lacking.

Overall, the ID5 is a well-rounded SUV that offers a good balance of features and practicality at a competitive price, especially considering its electric powertrain.  It’s a solid choice for buyers seeking a stylish and comfortable electric SUV, although potential buyers should consider the driving characteristics and range limitations compared to more powerful alternatives.”

“The Dacia Duster boasts practical design and value, offering a comfortable ride and surprisingly spacious interiors for its size. Its rugged appeal is enhanced by its four-wheel drive system and a hybrid engine option for improved fuel efficiency. While the interior isn’t luxurious, it’s functional and user-friendly, with a dashboard interface that’s surprisingly sleek. The Duster’s steering is responsive, and it handles well on moderately rough roads.  Its ride quality is a little bouncy, but the firmer suspension does a reasonable job of absorbing bumps.  Visibility is a slight concern due to the shallow front window line, but all models benefit from reversing cameras and a decent turning circle. Practicality is a key strength, with ample boot space for luggage and a large rear seat that offers good flexibility for passengers. The Duster’s hybrid engine delivers respectable fuel economy, making it a practical choice for those seeking to reduce running costs. However, the ride can be somewhat rougher than some competitors.  The steering is fairly precise, though it does have a noticeable amount of fidgeting when tackling uneven surfaces.

“The Dacia Bigster offers a substantial package for its size, providing a roomy interior and a surprisingly spacious boot, making it a viable option for families and those needing ample cargo space. The styling is undeniably appealing, and the car’s dimensions provide a significant advantage over many competitors in its class. While the ride comfort is decent, it’s noticeably dampened, especially on rough roads, and the steering can feel a bit numb. The Dacia Bigster’s interior lacks premium materials and feels somewhat utilitarian, with a hard plastic dashboard and a prominent strip across the width of the dashboard. However, the touchscreen infotainment system is a standout feature, offering a modern and intuitive interface. 

The engine lineup includes a mild hybrid option for improved fuel economy and a four-wheel-drive model that enhances traction. The full hybrid provides impressive fuel efficiency, though it's not a true electric alternative. The Dacia Bigster’s interior design is a bit bland, with a limited range of color options. The car's practicality is commendable, particularly the large boot and folding seats.  

Overall, the Dacia Bigster offers a compelling value proposition, particularly considering its large size and impressive space. However, its somewhat underwhelming interior, dampened ride, and average reliability should be considered when making a purchase decision. It’s a good choice if you prioritize cargo capacity and are comfortable with a less luxurious interior experience.”

“The Fiat Panda 44 is a compact city car offering a surprisingly capable four-wheel drive system suitable for light off-roading. It boasts a stylish cabin design with a squaredoff circular border and a wide array of camouflage color trims. While the infotainment system is somewhat basic, it includes a stereo and CD player, though it’s less intuitive than smartphone mirroring. The Fiat Panda 44’s compact size results in decent headroom in both front and rear seats, though back seat legroom is limited on longer journeys. The boot offers 225 liters, sufficient for a weekly shop but smaller than the SEAT Arona and Renault Captur. The Fiat Panda 44’s petrol engine delivers 85hp, accelerating from 062mph in 12.1 seconds and returning 57.6mpg, with a 0.9litre diesel option for motorway use. It’s not the fastest, but it’s fuel-efficient and quieter on the highway. While not ideal for high-speed driving, it’s nimble in town and easy to maneuver. It’s reasonably comfortable over rough roads and lacks significant lean in corners. The Fiat Panda 44’s jacked-up suspension enhances its off-road capability, allowing it to handle mud and rutted fields with ease. While it doesn't match the Jimny's bouldertraversing abilities, it’s capable of tackling a few inches of snow or a field of uneven terrain.”
