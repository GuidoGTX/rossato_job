         "Is the MG3 a good car? The MG3 used to be a bit of a joke - the old one was the lowest-ranked car on Carwow - but the new model aims to change all that. Now, instead of being antiquated, it’s right up there with the best small cars for performance, efficiency and equipment. Like an air fryer from the middle of Lidl, the MG3’s feature set is as good as any of its alternatives and it’s not immediately clear where the money’s been saved to bring it in at such a low price. Now that it’s a full self-charging hybrid car, the MG3 no longer targets the very cheapest on the market like the Dacia Sandero or Citroen C3 Origin. Instead, it’s more like a cut-price alternative to the Renault Clio E-Tech or Toyota Yaris - a halfway house for people who want the most efficient small car possible, but either don’t want or can’t have a fully electric model. The MG3 won’t win awards for its practicality - it’s not cramped, but it’s no better than average in this regard with a boot that’s about halfway between the Yaris and the Clio in capacity. Rear seat space is moderate, too, though annoyingly the rear seats don’t split when they fold which does limit overall versatility. The front of the cabin looks great, and very modern - in stark contrast to the car it replaces. Poke around and you can find a few places where MG’s saved money - there’s a sliding cover for one of the storage compartments that feels comically flimsy, and the top of the dash and the door cards are made of hard plastic - but the Clio and the Yaris have areas that feel equally cheap. The new MG3 is a transformation from the old model, and instantly becomes one of the best small cars you can buy Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer More importantly, MG’s given the 3 its best touchscreen infotainment system yet, and it’s loaded with equipment - climate control, a digital dashboard, sat-nav and a full suite of assisted driving features are standard on every model. The MG’s hybrid system is brand-new, and puts out an impressive 191hp - versus 140hp for the Clio and up to 130hp for the Yaris. That means it’s easily got any of them beat in a drag race, and makes mincemeat of overtakes or motorway sliproads. It’s not quite as efficient as the alternatives, but you might decide that the additional performance makes the small drop in mpg worthwhile. The real surprise is what happens when you reach a twisty road. The old MG3 was always shockingly good fun in the corners, but unexpectedly MG has managed to repeat the trick. The new MG3 handles brilliantly for a small car, and that makes it one of the most enjoyable small cars to drive. Sound interesting? Check here for our best MG3 deals, or look for a used MG3 on Carwow here. You could also check out other used MGs here, and remember that Carwow can even help you sell your car online too.",

         "Is the MG ZS a good car? The previous-generation MG ZS was a small SUV that you’d buy because it was cheap - and then spend the rest of your time apologising for it. It was unattractive, thirsty, poor to drive and had a really cheap-feeling interior. However, the second-generation model has had a true Cinderella-style glow-up, and should push the old car right to the back of everybody’s minds - it’s a huge improvement in every way. Based on the same mechanical underpinnings as the excellent MG3 hatchback, the new ZS gets an up-to-date hybrid engine, techy interior and a smart - if not stunning - new look. It’s like trading in your old Nokia for a new smartphone. Probably not the latest Apple iPhone, as MG is still firmly a budget brand - more like one of those off-brand Android phones that gives you lots and lots of bang for your buck. As a small hybrid SUV, there are alternatives to the MG ZS coming from every corner. Some of the best include the Renault Captur, the Hyundai Kona Hybrid, the Peugeot 2008 or the Carwow award-winning Toyota Yaris Cross. MG does things a bit differently to those cars, though. First of all, there’s the way the hybrid system works. It’s far more powerful than any of those alternatives - with 191hp beating out 140hp in the Captur or a measly 115hp in the Yaris Cross. MG’s done this by fitting a more powerful electric motor and a bigger battery, which means that most of the time it drives like an electric car with a petrol generator. However, if you put your foot down both power sources will give their all, making this quite a rapid little SUV. The ZS undercuts almost every alternative on price while offering loads of space and a powerful engine - but you may want to pay a little extra for a more polished ownership experience Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The comparison is also pretty favourable when it comes to interior space. The ZS has enough room for a six-foot adult to sit behind a driver of the same size in comfort, which means it’s also great for child seats or lanky teenagers. The 443-litre boot is also bigger than the hybrid Renault Captur or the Toyota Yaris Cross, and only marginally smaller than the Hyundai Kona hybrid. It’s in the cabin where you notice evidence of MG’s cost-cutting, though - there are plenty of low-rent material choices, and infotainment software that despite being a huge improvement on the old ZS isn’t as easy to use or as intuitive as the best systems out there. You do get loads of equipment, though. The top-spec Trophy model is still inexpensive but comes with climate control, sat-nav, smartphone connectivity, leather upholstery and a full suite of driver assistance tech including the semi-autonomous MG Pilot system. To drive, it’s another huge leap from the old car, which was pretty dire on the road. The ZS isn’t as satisfying to drive as a Renault Captur or Toyota Yaris Cross, despite its superior power output - but it has light controls and good visibility, making it great around town. Only poor refinement on the motorway and quite crashy suspension let the side down. If lots of power and equipment for a low price capture your imagination, check out our best MG ZS deals right here. You can find a used MG ZS for sale here, or search other used MGs for sale. And remember that Carwow can even help you sell your old car when the time comes.",

         "Is the MG ZS EV a good car? The MG ZS EV is an electric SUV that goes up against the likes of the Hyundai Kona Electric and Kia Niro EV – both of which are now well-established options at the affordable end of the electric car market. It’s a bit like going for a pair of cheap Bluetooth headphones. It might not be from the obvious choice of brands, but it promises to do a similar job at a lower cost. Since its revival as a mass-production manufacturer, MG’s models haven’t been the most exciting to look at. The new ZS EV is in a similar vein, but this updated version now comes with a blanked-out grille and LED headlights as part of a tweaked front end. There is also a new rear bumper with altered lights. MG has also improved the interior design, with the main addition being a new 10.1-inch infotainment touchscreen that has updated software to make it much smoother than before. A 7.0-inch driver display has also been added that offers efficiency and safety information. But where alternatives may offer slightly more comfort and refinement, you’ll find a lot of scratchy plastics alongside the new carbon fibre-effect upholstery finish on the dashboard and leather trim on the seats. In the back, you have decent legroom behind even the tallest of drivers. But as the batteries are mounted under the floor, your knees end up quite high. Headroom is also not the best, with the panoramic sunroof on Trophy models eating into the space even more. Taller passengers may struggle to get comfortable in the back. With an adjustable boot floor as standard, you get 470 litres. This is on par with the Kia Niro EV's 475 litres, but is 140 litres more than the Hyundai Kona Electric's offering. Folding the seats down creates a 1,100-litre space, but the seats don’t quite fold flat. Although refinement and overall quality aren’t the best, the ZS EV is more than capable of being a practical option Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The ZS EV comes with two battery options. The 51kWh Standard Range and 72kWh Long Range options offer up to 198 and 273 miles respectively. When driving in the real world across multiple conditions and in all three driving modes – Eco, Normal and Sport – you get closer to 240 miles. But leave it in Normal mode and you’ll get nearer to the claimed figure. Around town, the steering feels light and accurate. It also doesn’t allow many bumps into the cabin at slow speeds, with the suspension setup in normal mode helping it out. On the motorway, you’ll notice a lot of tyre noise and, if you go for the top-spec Trophy version, the roof rails do make a slight whistling noise. It feels comfortable on the whole, but the seats don’t have as much cushioning or support as you might like. When applying Sport mode and tackling a country road, the ZS feels pretty stable. It isn’t the most engaging car in the world and it can scrabble for grip in damper conditions – but for most that won’t be much of an issue. With its competitive pricing and practicality, the ZS EV is a model you should consider. It may not be as refined as alternatives, but it can certainly be a useful option if you’re in the market for an efficient SUV. If you want to see what you could save on a new MG ZS EV, check out the deals page.

         "Is the MG HS a good car? The MG HS has at points been the best-selling car in the UK and it’s easy to see why. It’s a big, practical family SUV with a posh-looking interior, loads of standard equipment and a headline-grabbing plug-in hybrid engine option - but it costs about as much as most small hatchbacks. While the old HS was definitely in the ‘cheap but not very cheerful’ category, the new model actually feels like something you wouldn’t mind driving around - it has redeeming features other than its price tag. It’s a bit like a Harvester - nobody’s ever going to look at it as a high-end option, but if you’re looking to feed the whole family on a budget, it’s tasty enough that you don’t feel punished for your penny-pinching. The HS is a similar size to family SUVs such as the Ford Kuga, Kia Sportage and Nissan Qashqai - but with its low price tag, you might consider it on the same shortlist as much smaller SUVs such as the Volkswagen T-Cross or Ford Puma. Two more direct alternatives are the Citroen C5 Aircross or BYD Seal U - both big SUVs that put affordability first, and have plug-in hybrid engines available. If your main concern is space for the money, the MG HS is a great option. Despite a price tag close to something like a Volkswagen Polo hatchback, it has space in the back for a six-foot adult to stretch out, plus a 507-litre boot that’ll accommodate the whole family’s kit and clobber. Still remarkably cheap but now much more capable - the MG HS is now a car I could recommend for more than just its price tag Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer You also get a dashboard that looks pretty posh, with a dual-screen setup just like you get on a BMW X3. You don’t have to press very far to find out where MG’s saved money, though, and materials and build quality aren’t really up to the standards of more expensive cars. It’s also not the easiest to use, with very few physical switches, an awkward touchscreen interface and not much storage for smaller items. As far as engines go, there’s a choice of two. You can have a bog-standard petrol, available with manual or automatic gearboxes - these are the more affordable options, and though they’re not particularly offensive to drive they are a bit thirsty. The headline-grabber is the HS plug-in hybrid, which can do up to 75 miles on a charge. That figure is up there with the best PHEVs on sale, and it gives you tons of flexibility - it’s enough to do even the longest of commutes without troubling the petrol engine once. It also nudges the HS into the lowest-but-one band for Benefit-in-Kind tax, making it hundreds of pounds a month cheaper than the equivalent Kia Sportage or Ford Kuga for company car drivers. Both of those cars are better to drive, mind you - they steer more sweetly and handle bumps better, as well as being more responsive and reassuring in the corners. The gap is narrower if you’re just cruising round town or on the motorway, though, where the HS is impressively refined and difficult to dislike. If the new MG HS seems like the SUV for you, check out our best MG HS deals on Carwow. You can see our other MG deals here, or search for a used MG for sale here. And remember, Carwow can even help you sell your old car.",

         "Is the MG4 EV a good car? MG pulled an absolute blinder with the MG4, and much like the lovable underdog in a boxing movie it punches well above its weight division. It’s more affordable than alternatives such as the Renault Megane E-Tech and Cupra Born, costing around the same as the smaller Vauxhall Corsa Electric and Fiat 500e. You’d be forgiven for thinking that MG have taken a ‘cheap and cheerful’ approach to engineering the MG4, but that’s far from the truth. So far from it, in fact, that the MG4 received high commendations in the 2024 Carwow Car of the Year Awards’ Outstanding EV and Urban Living categories. Just look at it, a mix of pointy details, sharp creases and funky shapes such as the lower body cladding and split roof spoiler. It’s a refreshing looking thing; it still stands out against newer MGs such as the MG S5 and MG HS as much as it does its alternatives. MG4 EV: electric range, battery and charging data Range: 218-331 milesEfficiency: 3.6-3.8 miles per kWhBattery size: 51kWh / 62kWh / 74kWhMax charge speed: 150kWCharge time AC: 6hrs 12mins, 10-100%, 7kW / 7hrs 30mins, 10-100%, 7kW / 9hrs, 10-100%, 7kWCharge time DC: 39mins, 10-80%, 150kW / 35mins, 10-80%, 150kWCharge port location: Left rearPower outputs: 170hp / 204hp / 245hp It’s a shame the interior isn’t quite as novel, with a dashboard layout that’s so simple it verges on boring, but the material quality, fit and finish and standard kit is better than you might expect for the price. A 10.25-inch infotainment display comes as standard on all trim levels of the MG4, and though it comes with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, MG’s own software is rather basic. It’s frustrating to operate too, especially on the move, with too many menus to navigate. There’s plenty of room in the MG4 though; plenty of adjustability for you to get comfy behind the wheel and enough head and leg room for tall passengers in the rear - though it’s a bit of a squeeze when you’ve got three in the back. The 363-litre boot capacity trails the Volkswagen ID3 for space, and puts it well behind the Megane E-Tech. The MG4 comes with two battery options, offering 218 claimed miles of range in its most basic trim through to 323 miles for the Trophy Extended Range model. The top-rung MG4 XPower, which we’ve reviewed separately, offers a big power hike over the rest of the trim levels, but makes do with a 239-mile range. MG has fully injected its own personality into the MG4 EV, and it leaves you wanting to get to know it a lot more… Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Around town the MG4 is easy to potter about in thanks to its light steering, peppy electric motors and most importantly, its comfortable suspension. It takes potholes, speed bumps and cracked roads in its stride, and the same applies to motorways where the MG4 just soaks up the miles with ease. Yet even with its soft suspension the MG4 is rather fun to drive on a twisty road, feeling agile and grippy with little in the way of body lean. The X-Power is particularly rapid, but it’s different enough that we've reviewed it separately here. For a stonking value for money proposition, have a look at our new MG4 deals as well as our MG4 lease deals. You can also check out used MG4s from our network of trusted dealers as well as other used MGs. When it’s time for a change, you can even sell your current car through Carwow.",

         "Is the BMW 1 Series a good car? The BMW 1 Series is a posh family hatchback with a high-quality cabin and loads of cutting-edge tech. You may also be considering the Audi A3 or Mercedes A-Class if you’re shopping for a premium hatchback, and the 1 Series was updated in 2024 with a new look and an updated cabin. The 1 Series has always been the go-to if you want a premium hatchback with a sporty edge. It’s a bit like choosing a pair of Yeezys over some Dr. Marten loafers. There are very few small cars which feel as posh inside as the BMW 1 Series, and this was only improved during the 2024 update. All the materials feel soft and yielding and everything is really solid. Quality in here is much better than it is in a Mercedes A-Class. The tech you get inside is also really impressive. All cars get a huge curved display atop the dashboard comprising a 10.7-inch touchscreen and a 10.3-inch digital driver’s display, and it’s all very responsive and easy to use. Watch: BMW M135 review As is the case in most BMWs the driving position is spot on. There’s loads of adjustment in the seats and steering wheel for all drivers big and small to get comfortable. Once you’re ready to go, there are also plenty of cubby holes for you to empty your pockets into. Moving to the rear seats, the space on offer is best described as adequate. If you’re only carrying two people back there then they’ll have enough legroom, however headroom could be a struggle for taller adults. Getting three people back there is also a tight squeeze, and a Volkswagen Golf is more adept at carrying rear passengers. Boot space is also down on some of this car's key competitors. In the basic petrol model you get significantly less space than an Audi A3 or Honda Civic have to offer, however the BMW’s load area is a nice square shape and there isn’t much of a lip to haul items over. As for engines, there are just three on offer and they’re all petrol-powered. Entry-level models get a 1.5-litre three-cylinder with 170hp, then there’s a 2.0-litre with 218hp or the range-topping M135 hot hatchback with 300hp and all-wheel drive. The 1 Series really is a good, premium-feeling small car, it’s just a little bit expensive Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Once you’ve loaded the car up and hit the road, the first thing you’ll notice is that even the entry-level petrol model has a hot hatch feel to it. The steering is responsive and it’s great fun to thread down a country road, though the performance-focused M135 isn't as exciting as the Volkswagen Golf R, even if there's no denying it's fast in a straight line. The sportiness does come at the expense of comfort though, because even the normal 1 Series is a bit firmer than an Audi A3. This is especially apparent around town, where the car jitters around over potholes and broken surfaces. Still, at least the steering is nice and light and you get decent all-round visibility. Things settle down on the motorway, where the cabin feels nice and hushed. There’s just a hint of tyre roar disturbing the peace, but the 1 Series is a relaxing car for covering long distances. So the BMW 1 Series is great to drive, packed with tech and really well-made. Some alternatives are more comfortable though, and quite a lot of features are pricey options. Check out the latest BMW 1 Series deals if you fancy this as your next car and want to save some cash, or browse offers on other BMW models. You can also take a look at used 1 Series’ available now, and don’t forget that you can also sell your current car through Carwow for a great price. WhatCar: What Car? says...The design team behind the latest BMW 1 Series seem to have adopted a Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS) philosophy – and with good reason.When the first-generation 1 Series debuted, it was a proudly unconventional family car with a sporty rear-wheel-drive lay-out, bold styling and a wide range of engines, including a punchy six-cylinder petrol.While those features thrilled driving enthusiasts, they didn’t always appeal to the car’s primary target: families. So with the third-generation 1 Series BMW shifted to a more practical front-wheel-drive layout (with the option of four-wheel drive for certain variants).BMW 1 Series video reviewNow, as part of the 1 Series' latest facelift, BMW decided to simplify the 1 Series package further. In the UK you can get two versions – the BMW 120 and 123. They run on petrol and have mild-hybrid tech.The front end was given a sharper look, while the interior received a fairly thorough makeover – pretty much the whole dashboard has changed. So is the latest BMW 1 Series still competitive against its key rivals, the Audi A3, Mercedes A-Class and Volkswagen Golf? Let's find out…",

         "Is the BMW 2 Series Active Tourer a good car? Crossovers and SUVs dominate the family car market these days, however BMW is keen to prove that the humble MPV is still deserving of a place on the driveway with the 2 Series Active Tourer. You can think of the 2 Series Active Tourer as a more sensible alternative to cars like the Audi Q2 and Mercedes GLA, and BMW’s own X1. If those cars were a pair of trendy Nike Air Max trainers, the 2 Series Active Tourer is a sensible pair of Hush Puppies. In terms of premium people carriers, only Mercedes offers something similar, with the B-Class very much in the same mould as the Active Tourer - practical rather than fashionable for the size. It may not be as stylish as a modern SUV, but you can lift the 2 Series Active Tourer by going for the M Sport pack. This gives the car some sporty-looking bumpers, as well as 18-inch alloy wheels, making it look a bit less dowdy and a bit more aggressive. This may not hide the car’s boxy shape, but the plus side is a practical cabin. Up-front there’s plenty of headroom, as well as loads of adjustment in the seats to find your ideal driving position. You get plenty of storage, with a small cubby under the armrest as well as a big space under the centre console where you could keep a bag. The glovebox is an average size, as are the door bins. You can get a wireless charging pad in front of the cupholders, which has a helpful clip to keep your phone in place. The spacious theme continues in the rear. Headroom is still generous, and there’s plenty of knee room as well. There’s also a handy armrest with cupholders in the rear, and fitting a child seat is easy thanks to the exposed ISOFIX anchor points. As for the boot, you get 470 litres of space in the 218d models, or 415 litres in the 220i and 223i versions. Plug-in hybrid versions drop to 406 litres of cargo room thanks to a battery pack under the floor, although that’s still around the same as the 405 litres offered by the Audi Q2. The 2 Series Active Tourer may not be as stylish as an SUV, but it offers plenty of practicality and a really nice interior Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The Mercedes B-Class gets 420 litres of boot space, so slightly more than the petrol and plug-in hybrid Active Tourer, but less than you get in the 218d version. It’s worth bearing in mind however that the diesel’s additional storage space is situated under the boot floor., rather than within the main luggage area The exterior design may not be as exciting as an SUV, however the interior can easily match something like a Mercedes GLA. Everything feels really well screwed together, and the materials used are all high-quality. The overall cabin layout is very similar to the BMW X1 SUV, meaning you get the same floating armrest and wide central air vent, as well as the same 10.25-inch digital driver’s display and 10.7-inch infotainment system. Engine-wise, there are plenty to choose from. Only one of them is diesel though, the 218d with 150hp. Then there’s a couple of petrol models, the 220i and the 223i with 170hp and 218hp respectively. If you’re a company car driver, you’ll probably be looking at the tax-efficient 225e plug-in hybrid. This gets a 1.5-litre petrol engine paired with an electric motor, producing 245hp and capable of an official 56 miles on electric power alone. The plug-in hybrid makes the most sense around town, where the instant acceleration of the electric motor makes pulling out at busy junctions easy. Whichever engine you go for though, the 2 Series Active Tourer is easy to drive in the urban jungle. The BMW 2 Series Active Tourer may not be the most exciting offering in the family car segment, however if you’re looking for a well-made, premium-feeling car to haul the family around, and you’re not too bothered about looking flash while doing it, this car is certainly worth a look-in.

Alternatively, you can browse used BMW models, and you can sell your car for what it’s really worth. WhatCar: What Car? says...The BMW 2 Series Active Tourer and other MPVs have been suffering at the hands of SUVs in recent years. In fact, while people carriers used to be the high-rise wagon of choice for families, most now go for something that looks a bit more like an off-roader. To that end, car manufacturers have been focusing on creating SUVs that fit all niches and have taken their eyes off the MPV ball. BMW hasn’t. Instead, it’s looking to tempt families out of small SUVs with its own sporty-looking MPV, the 2 Series Active Tourer. That won’t be easy though, and it’ll take more than just good aesthetics and a premium badge on the nose. So what’s on offer? Well, BMW has equipped it with a class-leading interior and loads of standard equipment.The 2 Series Active Tourer also comes with the choice of a petrol engine with two different power outputs and mild-hybrid assistance or a diesel option. There are also two plug-in hybrid (PHEV) variants – perfect for company car drivers and those wanting to keep running costs low.",

         "Is the BMW 3 Series a good car? The BMW 3 Series is like Alan Shearer. No, it’s not from Newcastle, but like Shearer it has for generations been a reliable and impressive performer, able to out-shine European and world opposition at the highest level, and is still going strong even in its advancing years. While Audi might be re-inventing the A4 as the new A5 (rather confusingly) and Mercedes has brought out a new C-Class while BMW was just updating the 3 Series, this is still a car that looks and feels totally cutting edge, especially in how it drives. Though if you would also consider an electric car, the Tesla Model 3 feels more futuristic still. In terms of styling, the most recent round of updates for the 3 Series haven’t changed that much. There’s been some small nipping and tucking around the lights and grille, some new wheels and paint options, but the overall shape and style remains the same. That’s both good and bad — good in that, overall, the 3 Series is still a handsome thing. Bad in that it hasn’t addressed some design mis-steps, such as the way the 3 looks overly bulky around the rear wheelarches. Basic Sport models get chrome trim around the radiator grille, while M-Sport models look a little more glowering with blacked-out trim. Watch: Audi A4 v BMW 3 Series v Genesis G70 v Mercedes C-Class It’s in the cabin that you’ll find the bigger changes. BMW has binned the (rather attractive) separate digital instruments and infotainment screen in favour of the big, curved, combined screen setup taken from other models such as the 4 Series and 5 Series. This means that the 3 Series now has the latest and most up to date infotainment software — which can update itself via over-the-air links — but even though the old iDrive click-wheel has been retained, there are some fiddly bits to find your way around on the screens, and the graphics don’t look quite as nice as they used to. Space in the cabin remains unchanged, which means you get just enough for four adults to sit in reasonable comfort, but there’s not the stretch-out space you’d find elsewhere. The boot is practical, especially in the Touring estate, but remember that the plug-in hybrid 330e — a hugely popular model with business user-choosers — loses quite a lot of that space to the battery, to the point where a basic VW Golf hatchback has a bigger boot. Not that you’ll care about boot space much when you’re sitting up in the driver’s seat. The BMW 3 Series has long been considered the best of its breed to drive, and that hasn’t changed, despite the fact it’s bigger and heavier now than it has ever been. While we have to wait to see what Audi has cooked up with the new A5 saloon, the 3 Series most definitely has the beating of the otherwise-impressive Mercedes C-Class when it comes to the driving experience. This is still a car that looks and feels totally cutting edge, especially in the way it drives Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The engine range has shrunk somewhat in the past few years — your choice at the base of the BMW 3 Series lineup is now restricted to the petrol 320i or the plug-in hybrid 330e. Bye-bye diesel 320d — we shall miss your combo of easy-going performance and exceptional economy, though there are plenty of excellent used examples to be found. In fact, there are now no diesel 3 Series models at all, something of a shock when you remember how wildly successful they have been over the years. Mind you, the 330e looks like it might be settling into the 320d’s economy shoes, not least because a big battery upgrade now means that it can do as much as 62 miles on electric power alone, if you remember to charge up the battery (which can’t, alas, be fast-charged from public DC chargers). Of course, if it’s serious performance you want — but you don’t fancy the expense and insurance cost of stepping up to a full-on M3 — there’s the brilliant M340i with its 374hp, straight-six, 3.0-litre turbo engine. Whisper it, but that’s actually a more enjoyable car to drive even than the mighty M3 itself. If you want to bag yourself a great deal, check out Carwow’s BMW 3 Series deals.

WhatCar: What Car? says...The BMW 3 Series has always done the business for business people – and this latest version is no exception. It's a sporty rear-wheel-drive executive car that's available as a tax-efficient plug-in hybrid and comes with all the latest tech.The 3 Series has moved with the times in other ways too. As part of its recent mid-life facelift, the seventh-generation model we're reviewing here has gained some subtle styling updates – but lost its diesel engines. You can still choose from a range of strong petrol engines to suit most tastes, one with four-wheel drive (BMW calls it xDrive).Once you've factored in all the infotainment goodies and safety equipment you get as standard, the 3 Series looks like it's in with a shot at topping our best executive cars list.BMW 3 Series video reviewLet's not be too hasty though – there are a few other models that give it a run for its money, starting with the 3 Series' long-standing rival, the Mercedes C-Class.

         "Is the BMW 4 Series a good car? The BMW 4 Series is an upmarket coupe that seats four and is designed to be more stylish and fun to drive than the BMW 3 Series saloon on which it’s based. It’s also more fun than its main alternatives, the Audi A5 and Mercedes C-Class Coupe. The two-door 4 Series Coupe sits in a family of 4 Series models, along with the convertible and five-door Gran Coupe models, while the BMW i4 is the electric version of the regular 4 Series Coupe, with the coupe and convertible getting updates in 2024. But in terms of styling, if the German coupes were in an orchestra, the Audi and Mercedes would be tickling the triangle while the BMW tries its best on the tuba – that grille makes the most noise. Some will like it and some really won’t. Still, beyond that, the 4 Series is a good looking car. Its aggressive creases, sporty body kit and sloping roofline make it a sort of half-price BMW 8 Series. Inside, it’s not as in-your-face as a C-Class in terms of design, but it’s classier and the levels of quality are better than in both Mercedes and Audi. In Mercedes’ larger cars its infotainment system narrowly beats BMW’s for visual drama and the way it works, but in the 4 Series and C-Class (where Mercedes fits its older systems), it’s the BMW that takes the win. The BMW’s looks better, works better and comes with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Praise be. Audi’s system comes a close third on all fronts. The range-topping M440i is brilliant, but most people will love the 420i M Sport. Head to our deals page for the very best prices! Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The 4 Series has seating for four people and those in the front seats will have all the space they need. The driver gets a good amount of adjustment, but it’s disappointing that lumbar adjustment – good for staying comfortable on long drives – isn’t standard and only comes as part of a very expensive pack. Grrr. The rear seats are fine for legroom, even for adults, but they’ll struggle with head room if they are anywhere close to six foot. Getting in and out of the back is a struggle too, because there are no rear doors – but hey, it’s a coupe. Still, the 4 Series’ boot is a generous 440 litres, which is only slightly smaller than an A5’s and some way bigger than the C-Class Coupe’s. There’s lots of engine choice, and there isn’t a bad one. There are 2.0-litre and 3.0-litre petrol and diesels, ranging from 184hp to 374hp, but the majority of people will find the 184hp 420i 2.0-litre petrol a great choice. Do more motorway miles? The 190hp 420d 2.0-litre diesel will cruise more efficiently. If you want maximum punch, the M440d diesel and M440i petrol both have powerful six-cylinder engines with startling performance. Then there’s the high-performance BMW M4, which we have reviewed separately. Handily, all 4 Series models are huge fun to drive. They’re lower and stiffer than a BMW 3 Series, and turn into corners with more agility than an A5 or C-Class Coupe. The xDrive all-wheel drive system is available with the 420d and standard on the M440 models for added security in slippery conditions, plus BMW offers things like upgraded brakes, a sports differential and adaptive suspension to really spice things up. The M models get this as standard. That agility does mean the 4 Series feels harder over bumps in town, even in its most comfortable driving mode, but otherwise, its standard parking sensors and rear camera make light work of parking. On the motorway, the suspension feels less abrupt and the 4 Series cruises quietly, but like the lumbar support, BMW’s clever adaptive cruise control with lane-keep steering assist costs a fortune to add as part of a pack. More grrr. Despite these minor setbacks, we think the 4 Series is the best of its breed. See how much you could save on a new BMW 4 Series with carwow, or check out our latest used BMWs. And if you need to sell your car, we can help with that too! WhatCar: What Car? says...Historically, BMW coupés have simply been swoopier, less practical versions of their saloon car counterparts. Not any more – the BMW 4 Series is a rakish model in its own right.Sure, the 4 Series is based on the same underpinnings as the more sensibly shaped BMW 3 Series but the differences go well beyond losing the back doors. BMW has widened the car's rear, lowered the centre of gravity, retuned the suspension and stiffened the chassis.All that should help make the 4 Series even more agile and capable than its saloon equivalent through corners.

         "Is the BMW 5 Series a good car? Think of an all-rounder, and two things are likely to spring to mind. First will be a Swiss army knife – the global icon for ‘a thing that does everything’ – and the next could well be the BMW 5 Series. Since debuting five decades ago, this posh German saloon has proven time and again that it can offer comfort, bags of practicality, the latest technology and serious performance. It’s a similar story with its two key alternatives – if you’re considering a 5 Series you should also take a look at the Mercedes E-Class and Audi A6. Or perhaps the Lexus ES if you want a left-field option. The latest 5 Series clearly takes hints from BMW’s recent bold design direction as seen on the likes of the 2 Series Coupe and XM, albeit a little more subdued. That said, its styling is rather challenging, lacking the elegance of its predecessors. There are odd, incohesive lines around the headlights and front bumper, a front grille that seemingly mimics beaver teeth and the rear end looks like the designers couldn’t agree on what to do so gave up halfway through the process. Watch: All-electric BMW i5 review It’s a different story inside, with BMW’s latest infotainment system present and correct, combining a 12.3-inch digital drivers’ display with a 14.9-inch central screen. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are included as standard, and operate wirelessly. The overall design is pretty good and although some of the physical buttons have disappeared, forcing you to use the touchscreen more, there are high quality materials and solid build quality to make up for it. Artificial leather upholstery comes as standard, though you can opt for the real stuff, as well as a part-Alcantara choice if you’d prefer. So you get all the good tech, but if practicality is key, you might be a touch disappointed. Petrol-powered versions of the new 5 Series promise 520 litres of boot capacity, which is less than the Mercedes E-Class and Audi A6, though not by much. On the plus side, unlike those two cars the BMW’s boot doesn’t lose capacity in the plug-in hybrid version. A Touring estate version will arrive later if you need the extra room. The BMW 5 Series is available with one petrol engine, offering 208hp, and a pair of plug-in hybrid versions with up to 489hp. Notably, there’s no diesel version, which is a sign of the times given that this model is typically popular with those who rack up serious motorway mileage. The BMW 5 Series is comfortable to drive and has a lovely interior – shame the outside just looks so… bleugh Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer It’s goodbye to diesel, but hello to electric for the first time in a 5 Series. The i5 – reviewed separately here – will do up to 361 miles on a charge, but is quite a bit more expensive than the petrol-powered model. As you might expect, the BMW 5 Series is a comfortable and refined motorway cruiser. There’s a little bit of wind and road noise but overall it’s a relaxing way to rack up miles. However, BMWs usually excel at also being great fun on a twisty road, but the latest 5 Series is a bit disappointing in this regard. The steering is numb and doesn’t give much feedback about how much grip the tyres have, while the car just generally lacks the eagerness to turn into a corner that made old versions so much fun to drive. An Audi A6 is, surprisingly, more fun here… Regardless, this is a great all-rounder and just a fraction better overall than the Mercedes E-Class and Audi A6. Want one? Check out the latest BMW 5 Series deals available through Carwow. You can also see how much you could save on a used 5 Series from our network of trusted dealers, as well as other used BMWs. You can sell your car through Carwow, too. WhatCar: What Car? says...Lionel Messi has won football’s Ballon d'Or a record eight times, but he’s still got nothing on the BMW 5 Series, which has won 27 What Car? Awards over the years – more than any other model.Part of the reason for the 5 Series' sustained success is that BMW has done a great job of keeping it up to date. The latest version is even available as an electric car – the BMW i5 – which you can read about in our separate review. However, here we’re focusing on the other variants.The cheapest option is the 520i, which uses a 205bhp 2.0-litre mild-hybrid petrol engine, and there are also two plug-in hybrids: the 530e, which produces 295bhp, and the 550e, with a whopping 482bhp.

         "What Car? says...What could possibly top the BMW 5 Series? After all, we’ve championed it as one of the best cars on sale. Well, how about a 5 Series with an even bigger boot: the BMW 5 Series Touring perhaps? After all, you get the panache and luxury of the 5 Series saloon, but with enough space in the back for your dog to enjoy it as well. The 5 Series Touring features a great line-up of engines that come with mild hybrid technology to improve efficiency. There’s a full plug-in hybrid (PHEV) option, too, which offers zero-emissions motoring and very appealing company car tax rates.BMW has kept the range of trim levels simple: there's just SE and M Sport to choose from. However, unlike the saloon, there isn’t the option of a high-performance M variant.Now, the 5 Series is a previous winner of our What Car? Car of the Year award so you know it’s good, but it’s already had a mid-life refresh since then and a replacement is due to arrive later in 2023. So is it still a strong choice?While it sounds very promising on paper, there are plenty of other big, deluxe wagons to choose from. In this review we’ll be comparing the BMW 5 Series Touring with the Audi A6 Avant, the Mercedes E-Class Estate and the Volvo V90 – and we’ll also explain which engine and trim make the most sense in the range.",

         "Is the BMW 5 Series Touring a good car? The BMW 5 Series Touring is a posh estate car with a plug-in hybrid engine that makes it ideal as a practical family car, or for company car drivers looking for something comfortable to rack up miles in. It’s a bit like a Burberry backpack, because it’s posh and practical in equal measure. SUVs might be the on-trend choice, but there are plenty of estate alternatives to consider if you prefer to sit lower in the car. Other posh estates include the Audi A6 Avant and Mercedes E-Class Estate, or you could opt for a well-specced Volkswagen Passat. The 5 Series Touring isn’t the best-looking car, with odd angular lines in the bodywork that never feel quite as cohesive as more elegantly styled generations of old. Things get better inside, though, with a clean design for the most part. You get a smart piece of trim splitting the dashboard widthways and a pair of screens above this. BMW’s infotainment tech is some of the best in the business, with crisp displays and intuitive menu navigation. Aesthetically challenged on the outside, but the BMW 5 Series Touring should be a comfortable, practical estate car Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Boot space is up on the BMW 5 Series Saloon, increasing from that car’s 520 litres to 570 litres. Not a huge leap, but the more boxy shape should make it easier to load large items. It’s worth noting the Mercedes E-Class Estate has a roomier boot than this and the Audi A6 Avant, with the BMW’s boot the smallest of the trio. At launch, there’s just the one plug-in hybrid engine option. Called 530e, it combines a 2.0-litre petrol engine with an electric motor to make 184hp, while the battery provides a range of nearly 60 miles. This will be particularly appealing to company car drivers because of the favourable Benefit-in-Kind rate, though for the same reason the all-electric i5 Touring is also worth a look. Another plug-in hybrid, as well as a regular petrol engine, will join the line-up later. Although we’ve not been behind the wheel of this new model just yet, it’s likely to drive very much like the 5 Series Saloon. As such, you can expect a refined and comfortable car that’s at its best at motorway speeds, though perhaps not as much fun on a twisty road as its predecessors. If you’re interested in this car, find out how much you could save with Carwow’s BMW 5 Series Touring deals.

         "Is the BMW i4 a good car? The BMW i4 is like a 4 Series from a decade in the future. It shares a very similar outline, but uses all-electric power and has a slightly bolder design, as well as having a more advanced interior. It certainly won’t fade into the background, as BMW has fitted the huge kidney grille from the 4 Series Gran Coupe that the i4 is based on. In the cabin, the i4 has a plush finish to match other BMW models – it definitely feels more upmarket in here than a Tesla Model 3, and can match a Polestar 2. Entry-level models come with cloth seat trim as standard, but leather is also on offer for those wanting a high-end feel. Regardless, it’s a well-built and neatly designed cabin, but the infotainment is the star of the show and features the impressive curved display combining the 12.3-inch instrument and 14.9-inch infotainment screens in one sleek unit. Compared to the 4 Series Gran Coupe, it’s 6mm taller and sits 15mm closer to the road – but remains mostly the same. Taller passengers may struggle to fit in the rear due to the sloping roof line, but knee room is acceptable. As it’s based on a conventional fuel-powered car, there isn’t a flat floor in the footwell, so fitting three adults in will be a struggle. However, the door openings are a good size and it is more than comfortable enough. You’ll be happy to hear that it’s quite spacious in the boot, with the hatchback tailgate opening up to provide a roomy load space. The rear seats fold down to reveal a flat floor, too. The BMW i4 is the all-electric cousin of the 4 Series Gran Coupe. The M50 version is as fast as an M3 to 60mph, just not quite as fun to drive Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The i4 comes in three versions. The entry-level eDrive35 has 282hp and claims up to 299 miles of range, while the eDrive40 ups this to 366 miles courtesy of a larger battery. That version comes with a 340hp rear-mounted electric motor setup that also produces 430Nm. The top-spec i4 M50 version – which was developed by BMW's M division – is fitted with two electric motors. With one fitted on each axle, the M50 comes with four-wheel drive and has a stout 544hp and 795Nm on tap. With the same sized battery as the eDrive40, though, claimed range is reduced to up to 318 miles. Whichever i4 you want, performance isn’t an issue. Even the eDrive35 models can do the sprint to 62mph in 6.0 seconds. But if you want brutal electric acceleration, the M50 gets to 62mph in 3.9 seconds (we bettered that in our video, however). Top speed is 140mph, though, rather than the usual 155, because the range of an EV really suffers at high speed. In town, the i4 feels very comfortable over bumps and cracks in the surface thanks to air suspension at the rear, and it’s pretty nimble as well. M50 models come with adaptive suspension for further comfort, meaning that even the higher-performance model can deal nicely with poorer surfaces. As standard, the i4 features adaptive cruise control and a reversing camera – making driving on the motorway and parking much simpler respectively. Refinement is also excellent throughout the i4 line-up, with only tyre noise making an impression. If the i4 sounds like the model for you, check out our deals page to see what price you can get for this stylish electric four-door.

WhatCar: What Car? says...If you’re eyeing up an electric car but don’t fancy broadcasting it to the world, the BMW i4 could be for you. While BMW’s first proper stab at an all-electric model – the quirky i3 – was all about looking like it came from a sci-fi flick, the i4 is more understated.It's essentially an electric version of the BMW 4 Series Gran Coupé – and that’s no bad thing. The 4 Series and its close sibling, the BMW 3 Series, are pretty much the benchmarks for their respective classes, so the i4 has a solid foundation.BMW’s offering comes in three flavours. At the more modest end, you’ve got the i4 eDrive35, with a 67kWh battery and a rear motor.

So you can choose a traditional pilsner if you can live with an internal-combustion hangover, or pick the EV if you want to wake up feeling refreshed and virtuous in the morning. If you plan to stick with a conventionally powered BMW for a while longer, have a read of our review of the 5 Series. Here we’re focusing on the all-electric i5, and spoiler alert, it's good. The two models look broadly similar from the outside. With a smaller grille than some recent BMWs, the styling isn’t as divisive as other current Beemers. It’s a bit more understated, but it's certainly not a looker – though we have a feeling that the looks will grow on us as we become more used to the design. A slow-burner, maybe. There are two power outputs to choose from. The less powerful is the i5 eDrive40, which has one 340hp motor powering the rear wheels. Step up to the M60 for two electric motors, one for the front wheels and one for the rears. Being four-wheel drive has to be a good thing when the car has 601hp. The regular eDrive40 is quick, with a 0-62mph time of six seconds. The M60 reaches 62mph in a kidney-bruising 3.8 seconds. Both models have the same battery pack, with an 81.2 kWh usable capacity. In the less powerful, lighter model, that gives an official range of up to 357 miles, dropping to a maximum of 315 miles for the heavier range-topper. That compares with 376 miles for a Mercedes EQE 350, one of the alternatives that could be on your shortlist if you are looking for an upmarket electric saloon. Will you be able to travel that far in the real world? Well, the way you drive will make a big difference. When Mat drove the M60 in Portugal the range was closer to 200 miles, but car reviewers aren’t renowned for driving gently. Assume that’s a worst-case scenario, and the official numbers are a best case. The i5 has a lovely interior and incredible performance, it's just a shame it doesn't go a bit further on a charge Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Plenty of electric cars are fast in a straight line, but BMWs are supposed to be fun around corners as well. The i5 corners with poise, especially cars with adaptive sports suspension and active anti-roll bars. The trouble is, the i5 is heavier than the regular 5 Series saloon, weighing as much as a big 4x4. The M60 is especially heavy, which is a shame as the car doesn’t feel as light on its feet as we’d hope. Get carried away and the front tyres push wide surprisingly early. Drive more steadily and the i5 is remarkably comfortable and super-quiet, with only a murmur of wind and road noise. Inside, the cabin is a high-tech banquet for the eyes, with a huge twin-screen display and an exceptional standard of finish. Even lower down the dash and doors there’s no sign of penny-pinching. Only the brittle action of the indicator stalks feels less than premium. There’s plenty of space front and rear, too, although the big transmission tunnel that exists for the internal-combustion-engined 5 Series gets in the way if there are three passengers in the back. The car is packed with clever tech, although frustratingly perhaps the smartest technology of all isn’t available in the UK. The optional upgrade for the adaptive cruise control available in some markets will change lanes for you. All the driver needs to do is look in their mirrors to check that it’s safe, and the car’s sensors can tell that you’ve looked to the side and will swap lanes. Where legal, the driver can even take their hands off the wheel. The eye activation feature is launching initially in Germany, the USA and Canada. A UK launch date for the automated lane-changing function has not been confirmed. So, clever, quick, and very good to drive – if not quite great compared with BMW’s greatest hits of the past. Next to other electric saloons, though, the i5 is pretty much as good as it gets, and if you need a bit more practicality, a BMW i5 Touring is coming later this year.

WhatCar: What Car? says...While many people dream of being driven around in a luxury limo, few of us will ever be able to afford either the car or a chauffeur. The BMW i5 might be the answer: it promises first-class comfort at a more attainable business-class price.You see, the i5 is the all-electric version of the BMW 5 Series executive saloon. Indeed, the two look almost identical – the i5 wears a few \"i\" badges and has blanked-off front vents that help boost aerodynamics, but that’s about it.The line-up is simple, with a standard eDrive40 model and a sportier M60 xDrive to choose from. Whichever i5 you go for, you get an 81.2kWh (usable capacity) battery that should be good for around 250-300 miles in real-world driving.BMW i5 video reviewSo, what else might you be considering if you want an electric luxury car? Well, the Mercedes EQE is the i5's main rival, but if you can spend a bit more, you could also look at the Porsche Taycan – a sporty take on the electric saloon.",

         "Is the BMW i5 Touring a good car? The BMW i5 Touring is an electric estate car, which means it’s a very rare thing indeed. You get the same posh interior and silent running as the i5 saloon, but with a bit more practicality. It’s like a North Face duffle bag, because it’s big, practical and has designer appeal. It's also extremely good - so good, it picked up Highly Commended in the Comfortable Cruiser category of the 2025 Carwow Car of the Year Awards. As it stands, the only other electric estates in this price range are the Volkswagen ID7 Tourer and the Audi A6 Avant e-tron, so you might also cross-shop the i5 Touring with electric SUVs such as the BMW iX, Audi Q8 e-tron and Polestar 3. BMW’s modern styling is certainly an acquired taste, but with the i5 we’re either getting used to it or the styling department is finding its groove, because it’s a much more cohesive design than other recent models such as the iX. There are plenty of sharp angles and creases in the bodywork that give it a distinctive appearance, though base models get softer styling that looks a bit plain. There can be no complaints about the interior though, because it’s a lovely place to eat up miles. The seats are soft and there are quality materials throughout, and all trim levels get the same high quality twin-screen infotainment displays. They look great with clear graphics, though the menus can be really confusing to navigate around. BMW i5 Touring: electric range, battery and charging data Range: 279 - 343 milesEfficiency: 3.0 - 3.7 miles/kWhBattery size: 84kWhMax charge speed: 205kWCharge time AC: 12h 30mins, 0-100%, 7.4kWCharge time DC: 30mins, 10-80%, 205kWCharge port location: Right side rearPower outputs: 340hp / 601hp It’s spacious too, with plenty of adjustment to get yourself comfortable – you don’t get the same commanding view as an SUV, but the upside is that you feel more snug within the cockpit, rather than sat atop it. Storage is good in the front and there’s loads of room in the back seats, too. The main advantage of the estate body shape is that the BMW i5 Touring has a big boot – at 570 litres it should be enough space for the vast majority of people, and more space than any of the electric SUVs mentioned above, though the VW ID7 Tourer estate has more space still if you really need it. There are two motor options to choose between, with the eDrive40 being the more affordable car to buy and to run, with a top-of-the-range M60 also available with ludicrous performance at the expense of range. As such, the eDrive40 can go up to 348 miles between charges, compared with 314 miles for the M60, which puts it behind what alternatives such as the Audi A6 Avant e-tron (437 miles) and Polestar 3 (403 miles) are capable of. The BMW i5 Touring is an incredibly comfortable and refined car, and the practical boot is the icing on the cake Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Regardless, the way the BMW i5 Touring chews through those miles is incredibly impressive, because it’s one of the most comfortable, quiet and refined cars on sale today. You feel utterly cocooned from the outside world. That means it’s a great motorway cruiser, but also means pothole-riddled inner-city roads and bumpy B-roads do little to unsettle the car. It’s fairly composed going around corners, with little in the way of body roll, but you really do feel its weight, so it’s not a car that encourages you to drive it like a sports car. However, if you’re looking for a comfortable and refined car to cruise around in, the BMW i5 Touring has very few weak points, most of which are worthy sacrifices for something so comfortable and practical. If you’re interested, check out the latest BMW i5 Touring deals available on Carwow, or if you don’t need all that space we have i5 Saloon deals, too. You can also browse used BMW models from our network of trusted dealers, and when it’s time to sell your car, Carwow can help with that, too. WhatCar: What Car? says...Part of the appeal of luxury products has traditionally been their exclusivity, and yet prestige SUVs seem to be everywhere these days. So what do you buy if you want something big and upmarket that isn’t omnipresent? Well, the BMW i5 Touring might fit the bill.As an estate version of the fully electric BMW i5 executive car, this model’s closest rival is the Porsche Taycan Sport Turismo. But they’re far from direct competitors, with the i5 Touring having a less sporting focus and a much bigger boot.If the latter quality is important to you, you might also have the conventionally powered Mercedes E-Class Estate on your shortlist. Plus, it’s worth noting that the i5 will soon be joined in the BMW 5 Series Touring line-up by new 530e plug-in hybrid (PHEV) and 520i petrol variants.Here, though, it’s the i5 Touring we’re focusing on, as we compare it with the main rivals and look at everything from how good it is to drive to how practical it really is.OverviewThe BMW i5 Touring is a practical, hushed and luxurious choice. Plus, it’s surprisingly affordable to run as a company car, thanks to its low benefit-in-kind tax rating.

         "Is the BMW iX a good car? This big, striking SUV is the BMW iX, the German brand’s biggest electric model and an alternative to other luxury SUVs, such as the Polestar 4 and Mercedes EQE SUV. You might also consider it as a posher alternative to the Kia EV9 if you don’t need all that space. An electric family SUV isn’t a particularly wild concept these days, but it seems no one told BMW’s designers. Like so many of the brand’s other cars, the iX has a really striking exterior design. It’s a bit like Marmite – you might love it, you might hate it, but it’s hard not to have an opinion either way. From those sharp lines and creases on its bonnet and wheelarches; to its big alloys, massive, toothy grille and squinty headlights – it’s certainly a very busy-looking design. In white in particular, you could say that it looks like someone crashed the Space Shuttle Discovery into the back of some sort of giant robotic beaver. Someone should probably tell NASA… Its dimensions are more conventional, being roughly comparable to the current X5 SUV on the outside, but with an interior that’s closer to the bigger X7 in terms of the space. And while you won’t get the option of seven seats on this new electric SUV, its cabin doesn’t skimp on any sense of luxury, tech or eco appeal. BMW iX: electric range, battery and charging data Range: 259-377 milesEfficiency: 2.8-3.1 miles per kWhBattery size: 74kWh / 108kWhMax charge speed: 250kWCharge time AC: 11hrs, 0-100%, 7kW / 16hrs 15mins, 0-100%, 7kWCharge time DC: 31mins, 10-80%, 250kW / 35 mins, 10-80%, 250kWCharge port location: Right rearPower outputs: 322hp / 516hp / 610hp That tech appeal is emphasised by a pair of huge screens that dominate the cabin. The 12.3-inch instrument panel and 14.9-inch infotainment display combine almost seamlessly to look like one big, curved display – it's an impressive sight from behind the wheel. You get a wireless charge pad, multiple USB-C ports and a range of connected services too. Build quality is top notch, and it’s very practical too with lots of space for five adults to stretch out. Boot space could be a bit more generous, though. With a 500-litre capacity, there’s less room for bags than you’ll find in the Polestar 4. You can choose from three power outputs, depending on whether you are happy with a quick car or you feel the need to warp the fabric of space and time. All three have an electric motor at each axle for all-wheel drive and a battery pack housed low down beneath the floor. The entry-level 326hp xDrive40 model has an official range of up to 264 miles, while the 523hp xDrive50 has a bigger battery that will see it travel up to 383 miles on a charge. If that’s not quick enough for you, the iX M60 has 619hp, a range of up to 349 miles, and a 0-60mph time of under four seconds. The cars have slightly different maximum charge rates (150kW for the xDrive40 and 200kW for the xDrive50 and M60), but the long and short of it is that any iX will be able to use a DC rapid charger to go from 10-80% capacity in less than 40 minutes. Plug in at home with a 7kW charger, and a full recharge will take up to 16 hours. The BMW iX is one of the best electric SUVs to drive, and has one of the coolest interiors, too Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Whichever model you go for, the BMW iX is one of the best electric SUVs to drive. It might be big, but excellent visibility makes it pretty easy to navigate tight city streets, while the air suspension on xDrive50 models smooths out bumps in the road for a comfortable drive. Out on the motorway it's lovely and quiet, making long journeys relaxing, while each of the motor options will get you up to speed quickly. And when you take the iX down a twisty road it swaps serene comfort for surprising agility. This is still a big, heavy SUV, but it's one of the more capable electric SUVs in corners. All models have all-wheel drive, which helps offer reassuring grip as you accelerate out of bends. If this sounds like the car for you, head on over to our BMW iX deals page to see how much money Carwow can save you. You can also get a great deal on a used iX as well as other used BMWs. Want to sell your car online? Carwow can help with that, too. WhatCar: What Car? says...The BMW iX is unquestionably the most radical and technologically advanced BMW electric car since the i3 was revealed more than a decade ago.In fact, you can see the lessons learned from the groundbreaking i3 all over the iX. For starters, it’s constructed using a generous dose of aluminium, high-strength steel and plastic reinforced with carbon-fibre.The iX, though, is a luxury electric SUV and should prove far more usable because of its much longer electric range, bigger interior and boot, and extensive list of equipment. There’s even a super-fast and sporty M70 version for those wanting maximum performance.BMW iX video reviewDoes all that stand the BMW iX in good stead against electric rivals – including the Mercedes EQE SUV and Volvo EX90 – or traditional luxury SUVs such as the Audi Q7, the Mercedes G-Class and the Range Rover? Read on to find out…OverviewThe BMW iX combines attention-grabbing styling with a soothing and opulent interior. It’s also spacious, quick and extremely quiet.

         "Is the BMW iX1 a good car? The BMW iX1 is the German brand’s all-electric version of the ever-popular X1 SUV. The iX1 takes inspiration from the bulkier BMW iX flagship, while being the most compact family option of BMW's electric SUVs. It’s like getting the latest phone that’s one step down from the most advanced version but still on trend. Coming with the same exterior design as the latest X1, there are some blue tweaks alongside the kidney grille and angular headlights to mark out the electric version, but it's all very subtle. Sportier models also come with a more aggressive design. You get angular rear lights too with a 3D effect, plus a large rear window and sporty elements, such as the roof spoiler and low-end diffuser. Inside, there are few buttons cluttering the cabin – although that does mean you get fiddly infotainment and climate controls thanks to too many switches being removed. There’s also no iDrive control dial, which means you have to do all major functions through the touchscreen. The design is pleasing on the whole though, with soft materials used up high and on all the main touch points. In the back there’s a decent amount of space, with good head and knee room. Although quality on the whole is fine, it takes a step down from the front part of the cabin. That being said, it still feels like a top product. BMW iX1: Electric range, battery and charging data Range: 267-322 milesEfficiency: 3.5-4.0 miles per kWhBattery size: 67kWhMax charge speed: 130kWCharge time AC: 10hrs, 0-100% at 7kWCharge time DC: 29 mins, 10-80% at 130kWCharge port location: Right rearPower outputs: 201hp / 308hp Practicality-wise, the iX1 also holds its own, with an impressive 490-litre boot – only 10 litres less than the flagship iX. That being said, the boot is marginally smaller than that of the Audi Q4 e-tron, though larger than that of the Volvo XC40 Recharge. The iX1 comes with a pair of model options, both powered by the same 65kWh motor. The more powerful is the 313hp all-wheel drive xDrive30 complete with two electric motors, with one mounted on each axle for all-wheel drive. You get an official range of up to 270 miles, with the top M Sport having a slightly reduced max range of 267 miles. Then there's the front-wheel drive 204hp eDrive20 with a range of up to 294 miles. When you’re driving, it’s odd how much the iX1 feels like driving the much larger iX. The overall experience is refined and quiet, with little disruption from the outside world in terms of noise. It’s comfortable while cruising, but weighing over two tonnes contributes to the fact that you will feel some bumps through the cabin. With iX-style driving dynamics, the iX1 is well-balanced and has a premium feel. xLine has more than enough equipment for everything you need Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Around town is where the iX1 impresses most, as it is super quiet and with great visibility all round, you shouldn’t get caught out. The steering is light for easy manoeuvring, while it also doesn’t feel too big. The 'B' drive mode increases brake regen but doesn’t provide full one-pedal drive. Twistier roads do show up the weight again, as there's some lean through the bends if you’re going at higher speeds. But the steering, although lacking feel, is direct and you have plenty of grip. The iX1 feels remarkably composed and capable, and should be the benchmark if you’re in the market for an electric family SUV. It’s a shame that it’s rather expensive though. You'll want to check out the latest BMW iX1 deals on Carwow, then, to see how much you could save. There are also great deals on used iX1s, as well as other used BMWs. If you’re also interested in changing your car altogether, you can sell your car through Carwow, with dealers bidding on your car so you can get the best price. WhatCar: What Car? says...If you're a fan of simplicity, there's something pleasing about BMW's electric SUV naming strategy – just add an \"i\" to the petrol equivalent's name. So the BMW iX1 we're reviewing here is (you guessed it) an X1 with a battery instead of a fuel tank.The subtle electric makeover means the best way to tell that you're looking at an iX1 rather than a BMW X1 is to look for the closed-off grille and blue trim highlights.Or you could look under the bonnet. The iX1 gets the same underpinnings as its sibling but ditches the engine in favour of an electric motor driving the front wheels – or two motors driving all the wheels if you go for the four-wheel-drive model.BMW X1 vs BMW iX1 video reviewMost of BMW’s electric cars have been star performers in their classes so far, but does the iX1 continue that theme? Well, it's certainly powerful and can manage a reasonable distance between charges – but then so can many of its rivals.To name a few, there's the comfy and spacious Audi Q4 e-tron, the stylish Mini Countryman Electric, the sleeker looking Kia EV6 and the big-selling Tesla Model Y.

         "Is the BMW iX2 a good car? BMW has really made a mark in the electric car market, and the iX2 is the latest addition to its EV stable. As with the petrol-powered X2, it’s based on the same mechanical package as the iX1 electric SUV, but gets sharper exterior styling that comes a little at the expense of practicality. It’s a bit like sports fleece jackets — the iX1 is a roomy and comfy fleece, designed for practicality, while the iX2 is more sporty and form-fitting, with a tailored look to it. The iX2 is entering a pretty crowded marketplace when it comes to stylish electric SUVs and crossovers — there’s already the choice of the Audi Q4 e-tron Sportback, the Volvo EC40, and of course the big-selling Tesla Model Y. On the outside, the iX2 looks very much the same as the petrol X2 — if you’re trying to tell them apart, really aside from the badges the only way to do so is to look at the grille, which is blanked-off for the iX2. If you fancy an electric car but maybe don’t fancy making too big a visual statement about it, that could be a good thing for you. BMW iX2: electric range, battery and charging data Range: 266-282 milesEfficiency: 3.6-3.8 miles per kWhBattery size: 64.8kWhMax charge speed: 130kWCharge time AC: 10hrs 0mins, 0-100%, 7kWCharge time DC: 29mins, 10-80%, 130kWCharge port location: Right rearPower outputs: 204hp / 313hp That sharply-sloping rear roofline certainly marks the iX2 out as being one of the more stylish and dramatic-looking electric SUVs you can buy — it’s definitely more interesting to look at than the slightly blobby Audi or Tesla — but it won’t be to everyone’s taste. Inside, the cabin looks and feels very modern and high-tech, but some of the materials used are too cheap when you’re shopping at the more expensive end of the iX2’s price list. The big, wide, curved-screen layout for the infotainment screen and the driver’s instruments looks great though, and it’s hugely responsive. The layout is fairly easy to find your way around, too, and the on-screen icons are large and easy to press, but there are a few too many complicated sub-menus for some functions. Practicality takes a hit compared to the iX1, as despite the boot being large on paper compared to most alternatives the sloping roof limits the size of loads that you can take. And while the rear seats are really roomy for two adults, the centre seat is almost useless - making the iX2 a four-seater except for very occasional use. With 313hp and all-wheel drive, the BMW iX2 has the performance to back up the car's sporty looks Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer BMW sells two versions of the iX2. Although they use the same size of battery, the more powerful all-wheel drive version doesn’t go as far on a charge as the less powerful two-wheel drive version, which can go 282 miles. The iX2 is as quiet and refined as you’d hope from an electric car, but while it does drive well, and can corner hard, there’s maybe not the gap between it and rivals from Volvo and Audi that there used to be. The steering is satisfying, although a little odd at times, and performance is ample. Like the iX1 it’s up there as one of the benchmarks in the sector. If you’re interested, check out the latest BMW iX2 deals on Carwow. You can also check out used BMW iX2s for sale, or other used BMWs here. And remember that when the time comes for car-changing you can even sell your car online through Carwow’s network of trusted dealers. WhatCar: What Car? says...It's been suggested the human attention span is shortening, and if that's true (are you still with us...?) we reckon the BMW iX2 could help reverse the trend.We’re referring to the iX2's attention-grabbing styling. With its chunky SUV body, sleek coupé-like roof and a front grille that resembles a pair of neighbouring caves or huge nostrils, this electric SUV has looks that should make people stop to inspect the details.Whether, after inspection, they decide the iX2 is a beauty or a beast is another matter, but it’ll get owners noticed more than if they were in the closely related BMW iX1, which has a more traditional boxy shape.If you decide you want one, there's no need to choose a trim level or battery size because there's only one of each, but there are two power options, one with four-wheel drive. There's also a petrol version, which you can read about in our BMW X2 review.So is the BMW iX2 a worthy competitor to the best electric SUVs with coupé looks, ranging from the Audi Q4 Sportback e-tron and Skoda Enyaq Coupé to the Volvo EC40?

         "Is the BMW iX3 a good car? The BMW iX3 is the company’s electric SUVs and an alternative to the Audi e-tron, Mercedes EQC, Ford Mustang Mach-E and Skoda Enyaq. It’s the BMW equivalent of the Monsters Inc story. Until now, the company has used scary old petrol and diesel to generate power, but now they’ve found out that laugh-a-minute electricity actually works a whole lot better for everybody, and makes you smile, too. So the iX3 is new, but just doesn’t look it. Up front, there’s the usual BMW grille, but it’s all a clever ruse because it doesn’t have to cool an engine, so it has been sealed to help reduce drag and give the car’s range a small boost. A dimpled pattern breaks up what would otherwise be a big sheet of black plastic. The 20-inch wheels are unique to the BMW iX3, too. Their heavily sculpted design helps to smooth airflow along the side of the car, improving range, although they look exceptionally vulnerable to kerbing. Assorted blue highlights to designate the electric model dotted around the iX3 – most obviously on the rear bumper where you’d normally spot some exhaust pipes – finish off the styling changes. There are also blue highlights around the ‘grille’, the badges and the sills. EV Range Test: Audi Q4 e-tron v BMW iX3 v Hyundai Ioniq 5 v Kia EV6 v Skoda Enyaq Under the skin is a solitary 286hp electric motor that also generates 400Nm of torque and drives the rear wheels. There’s an 80kWh battery pack that should give a range of up to 285 miles – that’s according to the latest official testing procedure. That’s a bit more than key alternatives such as the Audi e-tron and Mercedes-Benz EQC, but a bit less than the Jaguar I-Pace. In the real world it will be a bit below that, especially in cold, wet conditions. The iX3 should be compatible with almost every kind of charging station or power outlet, including super-fast 150kW chargers, which can give an 80% recharge in just 34 minutes. This means you can add 60-ish miles of range in about 10 minutes. There aren’t many 150kW chargers in the UK, but the network is growing. BMW iX3: electric range, battery and charging data Range: 286 - 290 milesEfficiency: 3.4-3.5 miles per kWhBattery size: 74kWhMax charge speed: 150kW / 250kWCharge time AC: 7hrs 30mins, 0-100%, 11kWCharge time DC: 34mins, 0-80%, 150kWCharge port location: Right rearPower outputs: 282hp Charging from less powerful outlets (such as a home wall-box charger or three-pin plug) will take longer – BMW reckons a full charge from empty will take around 12 hours. While electricity prices have risen lately, they’re not rising as fast as the cost of petrol or diesel, so an electric iX3 will still be much cheaper to run than a conventional X3. All electric cars feature brake regeneration – a system that uses the electric motor as an extra brake that can feed energy back to the batteries that would otherwise be lost as the car slows down. This always happens when you press the brake pedal, but the iX3 joins many of the latest electric cars by giving the system the ability to bring you to a stop when you lift off the accelerator pedal, too. It allows for one-pedal driving, which (once you’re used to it) is an extremely relaxing way of dealing with urban traffic. It’s not the fastest version of the X3, but it’s still pretty quick with a 0-60mph time of 6.8 seconds. Top speed is limited to 112mph, which helps to preserve range. It’s more than enough for UK drivers, anyway. The first thing you notice when you get out and about in your iX3 is how quiet it is. There’s no noise from the engine and transmission, so you only notice a little wind and road noise as your speed rises. A 285-mile range puts BMW right in the ballpark. It's better than a Mercedes EQC but not as good as a Jaguar I-Pace Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Adaptive suspension is fitted to the iX3 as standard, so it’s pretty comfortable, although a Mercedes EQC still trumps it for out-and-out ride quality. However, the suspension stops the iX3’s body from rolling too much during cornering. The iX3 grips strongly, too, and its handling is doubtless helped by the fact that the batteries are stored in the floor, lowering the centre of gravity. Flicking the suspension into Sport model firm things up a lot, to the extent that it makes the ride too firm, but it certainly sharpens the handling and gives the iX3 a distinctly sporty feel. All iX3s are well equipped. The entry-level M Sport comes with a 12.3-inch digital driver’s display and 12.3-inch touchscreen infotainment system, wireless phone charging, electrically adjustable leather seats, adaptive suspension (which lets you choose between soft, comfortable settings and stiffer, sportier ones) and a panoramic glass roof. The top-spec M-Sport Pro car has a Harman Kardon audio system, a head-up display and an automatic parking system.

WhatCar: What Car? says...The BMW iX3 electric SUV marked a change of direction for the German brand – at least when it came to building cars that run on batteries.What do we mean by that? Well, when the iX3 first showed up, BMW’s only previous electric car was the much smaller BMW i3 hatchback, which was built from the ground up to run on electricity but looked a bit too futuristic for most to get on board with.The iX3 took a different approach: it's essentially an electric SUV version of the BMW X3 (a family SUV available with petrol and diesel engines). In fact the only features that mark it out visually from the X3 are the solid plastic grille, aerodynamic alloy wheels and a smattering of blue highlights.BMW iX3 video reviewIt’s been around for a long time now though, so is the BMW iX3 still good enough to compete with the best electric SUVs – from the Audi Q6 e-tron and the Mercedes EQE SUV to the Tesla Model Y. This review will tell you everything you need to know.OverviewThe BMW iX3 struggles to compete when it comes to charging speeds and range, but it makes up for that by being good to drive, practical and smart inside with a fab infotainment system.

         "Is the BMW X1 a good car? The BMW X1 is the baby of the Bavarian brand’s SUV range, headed by the enormous X7 seven-seater. It may still be the entry level SUV model, but the current model is far removed from the awkward-looking compact SUV-inspired hatchback the X1 once was. Think of it as the youngest sibling in a large family. It’ll always be seen as the little one, but now it’s grown out of puberty, graduated university and it should be taken seriously. And the X1 really has grown, not just in character but in size being larger in every direction than the model that came before it. It’s a much better looking car now, with a bluff front end sporting a pair of squared-off grilles and aggressive headlights. It’s a boxy car all round, looking even larger than it is with sharp angles and crisp lines all over - especially in M Sport trim, whereas xLine cars ditch the aggressive body kit in favour of tough looking black cladding. The interior of the X1 is sleeker than the exterior, with a pared-down dashboard featuring a prominent pair of screens in a single wide display. They’re crisp and easy to read, but the infotainment menus can be a little overwhelming to use. BMW has opted to get rid of physical climate control buttons and use touch controls on the 10.7-inch screen instead, but it’s rather fiddly to use on the move. Otherwise the cabin layout is easy to navigate and pleasant on the eye, with minimalistic shapes and contrasting trims across the width of the dashboard to break up the design. Gone is the traditional gear level, with a tiny gear selector switch in its place instead. Space is good in both the front and back of the X1, especially with the sliding reach bench set all the way back. Tall adults won’t struggle for headroom and legroom at any position, though boot space is maximised with the bench all the way forwards. The X1 beats its German alternatives for boot space, at 540 litres versus the Audi Q3’s 530 litres and the Mercedes GLA’s 495 litres - though the Volvo XC40 has the X1 licked with its 578-litre boot. The BMW X1 is a great looking car in every trim level, and it's practical too. You get a range of engines to choose from, but it’s an expensive choice of small SUV - especially in M35i spec Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer BMW has given its small SUV a wide range of engine options, with the cheapest being the entry-level petrol model. There are fuel efficient plug-in hybrid options and a range-topping M35i high-performance model. All X1 models are good fun on a twisty road, but being a BMW it’s hardly a surprise. There’s little in the way of body lean when attacking corners and the steering isn’t too light for decent grip feel. It’s definitely sportier than alternatives such as the VW T-Roc and Skoda Kamiq. The M35i model is a cut above, but that’s to be expected with its BMW M135i roots. Motorways are a little noisier than you might expect from a posh SUV with some noticeable wind and road noise - especially on the larger optional wheels. In town the X1 can get shaken up over broken roads, but good all-round visibility, automatic gearboxes and a small turning circle make city driving a breeze. The X1 should be at the top of your list for a premium small family SUV, and you can check out Carwow’s BMW X1 deals here. If you know you want a BMW but you're not sure on the X1, have a look at other new BMW deals instead. You could also browse used X1s or other used BMW deals too. Carwow can even help you sell your car when the time comes. WhatCar: What Car? says...It's said that history remembers only brilliant failures and brilliant successes – and the BMW X1 falls into the second camp. Since the first-generation version was launched, more than 100,000 have found homes in the UK alone.So why has this family SUV proved so popular? Well, with its premium badge, the original X1 was something of a trailblazer that cornered a new part of the market. It’s a success BMW hopes to build on with this third-generation model.It seems to be off to a good start on paper. The latest X1 is larger than its predecessor, with more engine choices and just as much standard kit. Plus there are two plug-in hybrids with impressive electric-only ranges, along with a fully electric version (to read about that see our BMW iX1 review).BMW X1 video reviewDoes the BMW X1 continue to deliver on its posh and practical promise?

         "Is the BMW X2 a good car? The BMW X2 marks a dramatic departure from the previous model. The old X2 looks relatively plain and almost hatchback-like, but this new X2 gets sharper styling with a fastback rear and chunky sides, plus a big grille which optionally lights up at night. It won’t be to everyone’s taste, but it’s certainly more striking. Underneath, it’s using the same mechanical bits and pieces as the taller, more practical X1, so swapping to an X2 is a bit like kicking off your wedges and strapping on some stilettos — you can walk in both, but one is much more stylish than the other. There are several other sharply-styled SUVs you could consider, too. There’s the Audi Q3 Sportback, the Volvo EC40, the Lexus LBX, and the incoming Renault Rafale. The X2’s cabin is, of course, largely shared with the X1 and that means you get the impressive-looking curved screens atop the dashboard, which includes a big central infotainment screen and a digital instrument panel. A head-up display is also optional. For the most part, the cabin looks and feels quality, but there are some unpleasantly cheaper materials if you go looking. You do have to get used to operating almost everything through the touchscreen - including the climate controls and even some of the headlight controls, which is really annoying. But that’s a criticism that can be laid at the door of many of the X2’s alternatives. The X2 isn’t a case of style over substance - it’s good to drive and high-quality inside, but the starting price makes alternatives look cheap Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Surprisingly, the X2 doesn’t compromise its practicality too much compared to the X1. Yes, the sloping roof does mean that you can’t pack in big boxes like you can in the X1, but the actual boot volume below the luggage cover is slightly better. Space in the back seats is also fine, although you will notice that there’s less headroom and less light coming in than in the X1. You can choose from two petrol-engined options for the X2. There’s an entry level X2 20i, which uses a 2.0-litre turbo four-cylinder engine driving the front wheels through a seven-speed automatic gearbox. There’s also the X2 M35i, which also gets a four-cylinder turbo 2.0-litre engine, but which is amped-up to 300hp and has four-wheel drive and lower, firmer suspension. There’s also the all-electric BMW iX2, with a choice of two power outputs - we’ve reviewed this separately here.

And I can also sell your car online through Carwow. WhatCar: What Car? says...Whether it’s for the Brit Awards or the Oscars, picking out a bold costume is a great way to get yourself noticed – and that seems to be the approach taken by the BMW X2.With its chunky SUV body mixed with a sleek coupé-like roof and large front grille, the X2 refuses to be lost in the sea of family SUVs. True, it doesn’t have the curious silhouette of Sam Smith’s inflatable latex suit, but it’s certainly striking enough to have people doing a double take.BMW’s first-generation X2 ended up looking more like a jacked-up hatchback and struggled to make a memorable impression. It was also shorter than the BMW X1 so practicality took a small hit.This time round, the second-generation X2 mimics the shape of the bigger BMW X4 and BMW X6 while growing in size (it’s 54mm longer than the X1) so the rest of the family can fit in without resenting the buyer’s purchase decision.Read on to find out whether the latest BMW X2 is good enough to beat other sleek-styled SUVs, such as the Audi Q3 Sportback, the Cupra Formentor and the Range Rover Evoque.",

         "Is the BMW X3 a good car? The BMW X3 is an incredibly popular family SUV - more than 3.5 million have been sold since it launched in 2003. The latest model aims to stand out with its striking exterior design, ultra-modern interior and new plug-in hybrid engine. Both upmarket and eco-conscious, then, it’s like eating at a Nobu restaurant and ordering the vegan option. It’s one of BMW’s core SUV models, being larger than the X1 but smaller than the X5 - a true family SUV, making it an alternative to cars such as the Audi Q5, Mercedes GLC, Volvo XC60 and Alfa Romeo Stelvio. At the same time, many growing families may be looking to increasingly posh offerings from less upmarket brands as a way to get more bang for their buck - think the Hyundai Santa Fe or Volkswagen Tiguan. The old X3 did look a bit like it had been designed by a committee, starting with a generic SUV shape and just pasting on BMW’s signature features such as the kidney grilles and quad headlights. The new model is much more distinctive, with a very clean look helped in no small part by ditching the black plastic cladding that used to adorn the wheel arches. There’s also an eye-catching new grille which has a mixture of diagonal and vertical lines - though racier models get a more conventional look - and which can even be illuminated by a thin LED strip around the outside. The sides are smooth, with faint sculpting giving the suggestion of a wheel arch, and recessed door handles mean there’s nothing to protrude. It’s a similar story at the rear, which has a smooth tailgate and big, angular LED taillights. Inside it’s an even bigger change. There’s a large twin-screen infotainment setup and an interesting knitted texture on the dashboard, though it’s great to see BMW’s retained some of the features we love such as the rotary controller for the infotainment system that makes it much easier to use on the move than a pure touchscreen. The new X3 looks good and drives well - shame it’s not as nice inside as its predecessor Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The most obvious feature, though, is that where BMWs of old may have used tons of chrome trim, in the new X3 it’s largely been replaced with huge hunks of translucent plastic through which sophisticated ambient lighting shines. It’s quite effective, particularly at night, but it’s definitely an acquired taste and does highlight that the interior doesn’t feel quite as luxuriously built as the old car, with some quite cheap and nasty materials around. It’s also not hugely spacious for family life. The front seats are roomy but the rears are only average, and there’s a big hump in the floor which makes the centre seat quite uncomfortable. The boot is a good size at 570 litres, marginally larger than an Audi Q5 or Alfa Romeo Stelvio, but it’s beaten easily by a Mercedes GLC or a VW Tiguan. Storage for smaller items is also a bit limited. There are four engines to choose from in the UK. There’s a 2.0-litre petrol or 2.0-litre diesel, both of which provide plenty of performance for everyday life. The most interesting is the 30e plug-in hybrid, which has up to 56 miles of all-electric range - meaning low company car tax bills and big potential fuel savings. All of these models are fairly pleasant to drive with comfortable suspension and refined engines, though they’re not quite as enjoyable as the old X3 was. At the top of the range there’s a rapid M50 model, which has a 3.0-litre six-cylinder engine and plenty of performance upgrades making it a totally different car to drive. This version of the X3 takes aim at the Audi SQ5 and Mercedes-AMG GLC 43 and does so pretty well, thanks to tidy driving dynamics and plenty of performance.

Remember Carwow can even help you to sell your old car when the time comes for car-changing. WhatCar: What Car? says...What do the BMW X3 and the film Deadpool & Wolverine have in common? If you said they both belong to families with an X in their name, congratulations – you win a gold star. But the real answer is that they’re both unstoppable blockbusters.By being bold and branching out alone, Deadpool & Wolverine sliced through box office records, earning well over a billion dollars. Meanwhile, BMW's family SUV superhero, the X3, has sold more than 3.5 million units and counting.Competition is hotting up though. The latest Mercedes GLC is a fierce competitor (especially in plug-in hybrid form) plus there's the new Audi Q5 spoiling for a fight. Hence the X3, like a Marvel hero, has been forced to mutate.BMW X3 video reviewSo while this fourth-generation X3 sits on the same car platform as its predecessor, it's now longer, wider and lower, with a refreshed range of engines.

         "Is the BMW X4 a good car? The BMW X4 is based on the old X3, and it’s a sleeker, sportier-looking SUV that tries to convince you that it’s a coupe. It sits between the X2 and the X6 in terms of size, and while it’s not as practical as the X3, it’s arguably the more stylish car. It’s like a chic tote bag instead of a big, roomy suitcase. Not as useful, but rather more fashionable. Inside, the X4 doesn’t have the high-tech, big-screen setup of the new X3, and nor does it have the latest tech boasted by the Mercedes GLC Coupe, but the quality levels are very high and it’s a well-designed cabin. While the X4 doesn’t get the new X3’s big, sweeping digital screen dashboard, it does stick with the old separate instrument panel and touchscreen, both 12.3 inches across. The big screen in the middle uses older iDrive software that’s still good to use, and it’s easier to control on the move than a touchscreen-only system thanks to the click-wheel controller down on the console. Up front, there’s plenty of space even if you’re tall, and the adjustable steering wheel and excellent sports seats mean that the driving position is both very good and very comfortable. In the back seats, legroom is fine but that sloping roofline means that tall rear seat passengers will find that their heads are brushing the ceiling, and it’s a bit dark and gloomy back there. The boot is actually pretty good — it holds just 45 litres less than the roomy new X3, at least when you measure up to the luggage cover — and the floor is flat, with no loading lip so it’s easy to heft heavy items up and into the boot. The rear seats fold flat, and they split 40:20:40 for maximum practicality, but you do lose a good bit of seats-down space compared to the X3 — a full 200 litres. If you’ve decided you like the looks and don’t mind the BMW X4’s reduced practicality, there’s plenty to like about the way it drives and presents itself inside Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The standard X4’s engine choice is limited to just two diesels now. If you go for a sporty M model, there’s a bit more choice, with a more powerful straight-six petrol and straight-six diesel, and even a full-on 510hp X4 M if you really want to go nuts. All models come with BMW’s xDrive four-wheel drive as standard, and all come with an eight-speed automatic gearbox. The X4 is actually quite frugal, at least in 2.0-litre xDrive20d diesel form. Thanks to that four-wheel drive system being able to disconnect the front wheels to save fuel, 49mpg is theoretically possible, with low-40s being a realistic goal. It’s still quick, hitting 62mph in 7.9 seconds, which is fine unless you truly crave the 3.8 seconds of the X4 M… For a big 4x4, the X4 is decent to drive, and keeps its composure when traversing a bumpy, twisty British B-road. The xDrive four-wheel drive sends a bit more power to the rear wheels than the fronts, allowing for a more enjoyable driving setup, but the steering isn’t as talkative as it ought to be, and so a Porsche Macan (the petrol one, not the electric one) makes a more engaging car on a challenging road. The X4 can be had with optional adaptive suspension, and this is a must. Not only does it sharpen up the handling for twisty roads, in Comfort mode it also makes the X4 noticeably more comfortable over bumps. Without the adaptive springs, it’s just not as comfy as a Mercedes GLC Coupe. The new BMW X3 is far more technologically advanced than this X4, and comes with the option of a plug-in hybrid engine, but if style is what matters, then the X4 is still worth considering. If you’re interested, check out the latest BMW X4 deals on Carwow, or browse used X4 models from our network of trusted dealers. You can also check out other used BMWs, and when the time comes to sell your current car, Carwow can help with that, too. WhatCar: What Car? says...Some people want a car that doesn’t attract too much attention, and if that sounds like you, steer clear of the BMW X4. This large SUV really stands out from the crowd thanks to its combination of bulky go-anywhere presence and a bit of coupé curviness.It's a formula that's proved pretty trendy. Indeed, the bigger BMW X6 set the ball rolling, offering luxury SUV devotees a more streamlined alternative to the BMW X5.Likewise, under the X4's sleek body you'll find the same platform as the BMW X3 has – and that's a highly accomplished large SUV in its own right.The X4 aims to be not only be the better looking version (we’ll leave that to you to decide), but also more entertaining to drive than it's stablemate, although those swoopy lines do make it a less practical choice.Other premium brands have gone down the same road as BMW by taking an existing SUV model and lowering sections of the roofline. For example, there's the Audi Q5 Sportback and the Mercedes GLC Coupé with similarly slinky styling. Then there's the Porsche Macan – a car that had sporty looks from the start.",

         "Is the BMW X5 a good car? There aren’t many cars that can do what the BMW X5 can do: it’s like a roomy, comfortable hot hatch on stilts. It’s genuinely enjoyable to drive, much more so than alternatives such as the Audi Q7 and Mercedes GLE. If you want to get something closer, you’ll need to head to a Porsche Cayenne, but that’s a bit like a 100-metre sprinter at a marathon – it isn’t quite as comfortable or practical for families over long distances - which helped the BMW X5 to win the Adventurer's Choice category of the 2025 Carwow Car of the Year Awards. The BMW X5 has most cars very much licked on the luxury front, though. Everywhere you prod there are luxurious materials and soft-touch plastic, from the top of the dashboard to the door tops. Sure, the overall design is slightly more conservative than that of a Mercedes GLE, but for some, that’ll be a good thing, and an update in 2023 brought a much more modern design to close the gap. You get BMW's excellent twin-screen setup on the dashboard. The curved displays look suitably modern, with the one on the right displaying all the relevant driving information and the one on the left for your infotainment. It's a touchscreen and really quick to respond to your inputs, but the menus are quite complicated to find your way around. Group test: Audi Q7 v BMW X5 v Mercedes GLE v Porsche Cayenne v VW Touareg Another important factor in a large luxury SUV is space and the BMW X5 offers plenty of it. Those in the front will have no complaints and the driver gets a supportive seat with full electric adjustment and a memory function. There’s plenty of space in the back seats, as well – two tall adults will sit comfortably behind those in the front, while a third won’t be sounding off on a long journey either. That spaciousness continues to the boot, with the X5 having 650 litres, which is a good chunk less than you get in an Audi Q7 and Porsche Cayenne, though the BMW is a bit more spacious than the Mercedes GLE. There are four engines to choose from. The plug-in hybrid will be the best option for those who can charge regularly, and it also has the lowest tax rate for company car buyers. There's a sporty petrol if running costs aren't a concern, but most people will find one of the diesels offers the best all-round experience. In town, the BMW X5, despite its size, isn’t daunting to manoeuvre thanks to good visibility for the driver through its tall wide windows and standard front and rear parking sensors. In fact, BMW includes its Parking Assistant, which will steer the car into a space for you and you can add rear-wheel steering as an option for better low-speed manoeuvrability. Porsche, Land Rover, Mercedes and Audi all make very good large SUVs, but the X5 is the best all-rounder for us Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer It’s a comfortable experience, too; the X5’s optional adaptive air suspension does a good job of soaking up ruts, potholes and broken Tarmac in its most comfortable setting. That said, the M Competition’s firmer suspension (in the name of going around corners more quickly) isn’t as comfy when the going gets rough. On twisty country roads, the BMW X5 steers with precision and on its standard suspension handles well – particularly in its firmer ‘sport’ setting. The M Competition’s still-firmer suspension props the X5 up even more effectively through bends and the range-topper is more agile to drive. But, calm things down to a cruise on the motorway, and all the engines are quiet, while wind and road noise are kept to a minimum. You do hear more road noise in the M50i and M Competition with their huge alloys and super-wide tyres, though.

WhatCar: What Car? says...When the BMW X5 burst on to the scene more than two decades ago, it kicked off the craze for sportier SUVs that felt more like saloons than off-roaders to drive.Indeed, with the X5, BMW changed the face of the luxury SUV landscape overnight. The model went on to dominate sales charts (as well as the Best SUV category at our annual Car of the Year awards and its category at our Tow Car Awards).Unsurprisingly, it didn’t take long for rival manufacturers to respond. The Volvo XC90 joined the crowd first, bringing with it seven seats as standard.Then the Range Rover Sport came along, offering a triple threat: sportiness, luxury and proper off-roading abilities. Later, the Audi Q7 impressed us with its blend of seven-seat versatility, remarkable comfort and a truly classy interior.So, how does this fourth-generation BMW X5 rank among the best luxury SUVs? Read on to find out...OverviewThe BMW X5 is a smooth, classy and luxurious SUV. It's not quite as practical as the most spacious rivals out there but it's good enough where it counts, and where it really impresses is the quality of its lavish interior and superb infotainment system.

         "Is the BMW X6 a good car? The BMW X6 is a bit like Snapchat. When it first appeared, people wondered what the point was. Does anybody need a car that’s part SUV, part coupe? But like Snapchat, the X6 has defied the naysayers to prove quite popular. This large coupe-style SUV has strong engines and seating for five. It’s a sleeker version of the BMW X5 and an alternative to the similarly-styled Mercedes GLE Coupe and Porsche Cayenne Coupe. The X6 has been updated for 2024 but you still get the classic, chunky proportions that you expect from an off-roader, with a rakishly angled roof that echoes the sleek lines of a sports car. As is the trend in recent BMWs, the trademark ‘kidney’ grille is now enormous. It’s also available with illumination, to make it even more, er, eye-catching. Inside the look and feel is very BMW X5, which is a good thing. It has an interesting design but functional button layout and everything feels extremely well put together. It also means you get BMW’s latest twin-screen infotainment system, which looks amazing although some functions are harder to use than before the latest update. There are good and bad points to the X6’s space and practicality. Okay, so you’ll seat four adults just fine inside, but the X6 loses some rear headroom in the name of style compared with the X5, plus its middle seat is quite uncomfortable. The boot is smaller than an X5’s (and the Mercedes’ or Porsche’s) and a more awkward shape thanks to its sloping roofline. You’re paying a premium over the X5 for this, remember. The BMW X6 was the coupe SUV that started the discussion – you either love or hate the way it looks. This one has a light-up grille, which I’ll leave you to make your mind up on… Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer There’s a choice of petrol and diesel engines, but the highlight of the range is the performance-focused M60i. This twin-turbo V8 petrol has 530hp and a 0-62mph time of 4.3 seconds. The X6M Competition gives you more power (625hp) for a 0-62mph time of 3.9 seconds. That’s staggering pace for a car of this size and weight, but it is even more expensive to run than the M60i and requires more compromise to comfort. Even the entry-level engines are extremely strong, and given the diesel is the cheapest and most fuel-efficient of the range it makes the most sense. Whichever engine you choose, the X6 feels bulky but comfortable in town and more agile than it has any right to be on a country road given its size. On the motorway, it’s supremely comfy and quiet with the latest driver assistance tech available. The BMW X6 is a mixed bag, then. It’s superb to drive, has a lovely cabin and an eye-candy infotainment system. You’re better off just spending less money on the more practical X5, though, unless you really prefer the X6’s styling and don’t need the space. If that’s the case, you should check out the latest BMW X6 deals on Carwow to see how much money you can save. You can also browse the latest used BMW X6 stock, as well as other used BMWs. When the time comes, you can sell your current car through Carwow, too. WhatCar: What Car? says...Finding a truly unique car is rare, but the BMW X6 used to be just that. When the original version was launched, we'd never seen a vehicle that combined a chunky SUV body with the kind of sleek, sloping roofline you’d usually see on a sporty coupé.The X6's coupé SUV concept divided opinion from the start, and while it's now in its third generation, it continues to do so today. To some people it's a car that simply makes no sense because it’s more expensive and less practical than the BMW X5 it’s based on. To others, its blend of function and form makes it very desirable.What’s clear, though, is that there are enough coupé SUV fans out there for the X6 to have become a trend-setter, with a host of manufacturers now selling rivals. The Audi Q8 and Mercedes GLE Coupé for example both owe their existence to it, as do the Porsche Cayenne Coupé and Range Rover Velar.Just how good is the latest BMW X6 though, and how does it compare with the best coupé SUVs?

         "Is the BMW X7 a good car? Let’s address the elephant in the room – oh, and this elephant also has a set of comedy gnashers on. Yes, the way the BMW X7 looks will not be to everybody’s taste, but if you like your large luxurious SUVs to be imposing, it doesn’t get much more so than the X7’s whopping great grille filling somebody’s rearview mirror. In fact, the BMW X7 is arguably more imposing than the upmarket SUVs it competes with, the Land Rover Discovery, Audi Q7 and Mercedes GLS. Even a full-fat Range Rover. Think of it as American sports announcer Michael Buffer at a headteacher’s conference. Watch: BMW X7 v Range Rover Inside, things are more restrained, but suitably high quality. You’ll find plenty of piano black, leather and metal surfaces, while adding a (pricey) full merino leather option brings leather lower down and a two-tone shade. Ultimately, you’ll struggle to find any scratchy plastics here and the X7 gives all its alternatives a run for their money inside. The dash is dominated by the curved twin-screen display that incorporates BMW’s latest iDrive infotainment system. It’s stunning to look at, but not quite as easy to use as the previous generation. There are a few functions that are now buried in menus rather than easily accessible with a single button press. It still has a rotary controller with menu shortcut buttons between the front seats, and you can choose to use that, the touchscreen or use voice commands. The second screen behind the steering wheel takes the place of conventional instruments. It’s clear, crisp and configurable, so you can have the information displayed that you want, including things like speed, fuel consumption, navigation info and your radio or media selection. Bluetooth, DAB radio and Apple CarPlay smartphone mirroring is all included, although not Android Auto. All-in-all, it’s better than anything from Audi or Land Rover, although the digital dash and infotainment in the Mercedes GLS is even better. The BMW X7 is a proper seven-seater as standard, which is to say, two adults will be able to sit in comfort in its rearmost seats on a long journey. A BMW X5’s optional third row is much tighter, for example. For not much extra you can swap the X7’s middle row from a three-seat bench to two more luxurious pews. If you can live with six seats rather than seven, it's worth considering Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The X7’s front two rows are even more spacious and the driver is treated to a wide range of electric seat and wheel adjustment. In fact, the middle row can be adjusted and folded electrically, while the third row folds into the boot floor electrically too. Handy buttons in the boot allow you to fold the rear two rows all at the same time for ease. Even with all seven seats up, the X7 still offers 320 litres of boot space, which is about the same as a VW Polo. Fold the rearmost seats down and that grows to a huge 750 litres – that’ll handle pretty much anything a family can throw at it. And you get a fancy split tailgate. You have a choice between one diesel and two petrol engines when buying a BMW X7. The pick of the bunch is the X7 xDrive40d diesel because, with 352hp and an official fuel economy of 32.8-36.2mpg, it has all the power you’ll need, but will keep the bills sensible. The 530hp M60i petrol is much quicker, but also much more expensive in every way, while the 381hp 40i petrol is strong and smooth, but thirstier than the diesel. The BMW X7 is vast, so driving and parking it in town can be a little daunting. Still, it comes with front and rear sensors, multiple cameras for a 3D view of the car and a system that’ll park and even reverse for you. So, no excuses then. Out of town and on meandering country roads the X7 is one of the tidiest SUVs of its type to drive despite its size, but you’ll probably be more interested in just how comfortable its air suspension is over bumps and how quiet it is at a cruise on the motorway. There’s very little wind and road noise at all, and adding BMW’s Driving Assistant Professional optional package brings a system that will accelerate, brake and keep you in your lane for an even more relaxing drive. So, make peace with its looks, don’t get carried away with BMW’s options list and the X7 is a fine luxury seven-seat SUV. Remember, though, that it’s more expensive to buy than a Discovery or Q7, and that if you don’t need seven roomy seats, BMW’s cheaper X5 makes much more sense.

         "Is the BYD Atto 3 a good car? Another day and another family-oriented electric SUV to bring you. This is the BYD Atto 3, fresh from China, and aiming to find a place on your shortlist if you’re looking at cars like the Peugeot e-2008, MG ZS EV or Kia Niro EV. Like discovering after a few years working together that you went to school with your colleague on the desk across from you, the BYD Atto 3 may be more familiar than you realise. BYD has been manufacturing everything from smartphone components to electric buses since its inception in 1995, and recently has been selling cars in its home market. Now, it wants a slice of the UK pie. At first glance though, it’s not doing too much to stand out. Though its design is inoffensive (‘Build Your Dreams’ badging aside), there’s little about the car that’ll turn your head away from the plethora of choices you have in this segment. Fortunately, the same can’t be said for the eccentric interior. Be it the muscle membrane-like trim inserts, eye-catching vegan leather colour combination or the (functional) guitar strings across the door bins, there’s no accusing the Atto 3 of lacking character inside. BYD Atto 3: electric range, battery and charging data Range: 261 milesEfficiency: 4.0 miles per kWhBattery size: 60kWhMax charge speed: 150kWCharge time AC: 9hrs 42mins, 0-100%, 7kWCharge time DC: 44mins, 10-80%, 150kWCharge port location: Right frontPower outputs: 204hp Better still, build quality is impressive, as you’ll be hard-pressed to find cheap-feeling materials (unless you look way under the dashboard) – a rarity nowadays on more affordable cars. A 12.8-inch infotainment system comes as standard, with a 15.6-inch screen fitted to top-spec Design models. There’s a bit of a party trick to it too, as it’s able to rotate from landscape to portrait at the press of a button. Amusing for a brief moment, though you’ll likely find a preference quickly and leave it untouched. The software on the system itself is pretty intuitive – it’s essentially just an Android tablet. There are some teething issues to solve, though. You do get Apple CarPlay, but there's no Android Auto yet – said to be coming as a no-cost update sometime in the future – and the ‘Hey BYD’ voice assistant adapting to some of the UK’s more regional accents would be welcome. Legroom in the rear of the BYD Atto 3 is decent, though you may be left wanting more headroom. Kids in car seats will be fine, but it’s something to consider if you’re ferrying teenagers or adults around often. It’s a similar story for boot space, too; 440 litres of storage isn’t woeful, but it’s beaten by the Kia Niro EV and MG ZS EV, although it is marginally better than the similarly-sized Peugeot e-2008. The BYD Atto 3 has a quirky interior design – it's smart, but the guitar strings on the doors are just odd Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer All versions of the BYD Atto 3 are powered by a single electric motor, drawing power from a 60.5kWh battery. Official testing has its range at 260 miles, though a cold March day of driving the car in mixed conditions returned 3.3mi/kWh, equating to less than 200 miles of real-world range. If you’re planning to use your Atto 3 as an urban runaround, you’ll be happy to know it’s pleasant to use around town. Visibility is good all-round, and a standard-fit 360-degree camera is a nice addition for parking. Supple suspension results in a comfy ride over bumps in the road, too. That translates nicely out on the motorway as well, though prepare yourself for a lot of wind noise at higher speeds. On a back road, the BYD Atto 3 will wobble around a bit and doesn’t offer much in the way of excitement, but that’s hardly a dealbreaker for cars like this. For a first foray into the UK market, the BYD Atto 3 is a respectable effort. It offers the value and quality to seriously consider compared with the established names, though it lacks some of the polish you find from more familiar brands and that lack of space may prove a sticking point. If you like the look of this good value electric SUV you can check out the latest BYD Atto 3 deals through carwow. You can also look for a great deal on used cars and even sell your car online through carwow, too. WhatCar: What Car? says...The BYD Atto 3 is from a brand you might not be familiar with but that worldwide sells more electric cars than anyone else.In fact, last year BYD sold a colossal 1.57 million electric cars – more than Hyundai, Volkswagen and, at times, even Tesla. So, how come BYD isn't that well known yet? Well, it is well known in its home market of China, and if you've ever been to London you might have travelled in a BYD electric bus. However, the Atto 3 was the first car BYD offered for sale in the UK (arriving before the BYD Dolphin and BYD Seal).BYD Atto 3 video reviewIt's an electric SUV that's about the same size as a Nissan Qashqai and has a similar price to the Hyundai Kona Electric, Kia Niro EV, Smart #1 and Volvo EX30. In other words, it's not as budget-focused as the slightly smaller MG ZS EV.So how does the BYD Atto 3 stack up against rival electric SUVs in all the important areas?

         "Is the BYD Dolphin a good car? The BYD Dolphin is a mid-sized electric car bringing good levels of equipment and decent practicality, as well as a low starting price – all attributes that make it highly attractive if you're in the market for an EV and you don't want an SUV. Chinese brand BYD launched in the UK with the Atto 3 SUV, and its second model, also all-electric, is the Dolphin. Think of it as a pocket telescope - not impressive in size, but its compact dimensions belie its abilities to show users more than they bargained for. For example, the entry car’s price undercuts potential alternatives such as the MG 4, and significantly undercuts the likes of the Cupra Born, VW ID3 and Smart #1, as well as the smaller Renault Zoe and Peugeot e-208. But equipment levels impress, with kit including electrically adjustable vegan leather seats, a 360-degree surround camera and 12.8-inch rotatable screen all standard on even the entry car. But only the cars over £30,000 get the longer-range battery. And yep, rotatable. At the touch of a button, as long as you’re not using the landscape-only Apple CarPlay/Android Auto, the big infotainment screen will switch from landscape to portrait or back again. Most people will pick a layout and stick with it, but a neat party trick nonetheless. BYD Dolphin: electric range, battery and charging data Range: 196-265 milesEfficiency: 3.9-4.1mi/kWhBattery size: 45kWh / 60kWhMax charge speed: 150kWCharge time AC: 5hrs, 0-100%, 11kW / 6hrs 12mins, 0-100%, 11kWCharge time DC: 40mins, 10-80%, 150kWCharge port location: Right side frontPower outputs: 95hp / 177hp / 204hp The Dolphin comes in four different trim levels, only two of which offer the same battery, power, range and charging stats. At the bottom is the Active which has 95hp and a 211-mile range, while the top-spec Design has 204hp and 265 miles of range. We’ll go into more detail on the different options later on, and the two lower-price cars aren't available until a couple of months after launch. Once past the slightly odd name, the Dolphin has a subtly inoffensive style to it; nothing likely to court car park controversy, but it’s neat enough. On the inside, there is plenty to catch the eye, from the rounded set of switches below the screen that also house the gear selector, to the sweeping air vent surrounds that form part of a dynamic line across the dashboard. Rear seat space is surprisingly good for a car that doesn’t have a big footprint, with taller adults easily able to get comfortable one behind the other. That’s helped by the flat floor – a result of clever battery packaging – and the fact that you can get your feet just about under the front seats. Three rear passengers will be a squeeze though, which isn’t a big surprise in a fairly compact hatchback. Be aware that the bigger battery is only available with the more expensive Dolphin models - the more affordable ones are comparatively down on range Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Boot space is reasonable, and there’s a handy removable rubber mat to keep wet dogs or muddy boots off the carpeted moveable boot floor. It’s a deep space when set in the lower position, and offers a little more room that a Smart #1, Renault Zoe or MG 4, although not quite as much as a Volkswagen ID3 or Cupra Born. To drive, the most powerful of the three power options is a little too powerful for the tyres, especially in the wet where they have a tendency to easily spin the wheels. BYD has acknowledged they’re not perfect, and will be changing the tyres it fits to the Dolphin for cars built from November 2023. Otherwise it’s a pleasant and relaxed experience, although the car doesn’t always smooth itself over urban bumps. But it’s grown-up enough to settle in fine on longer runs, and the light steering is welcome for low-speed manoeuvring, although at higher speeds the standard setting is too light for engaging or spirited driving. It can be altered in the menus though, which helps. Much like the Fiat 500e, the Dolphin’s smaller battery should be ignored by anyone venturing far from home. The lower range is fine for urban jaunts, but the extra capacity of the bigger battery provides significant peace of mind. The Dolphin looks neat and tidy without breaking any new ground styling-wise, and is a well-rounded, well-equipped and practical car that opens up the electric hatchback choices even further. See how much a BYD Dolphin costs to buy through Carwow, or check out the full range of BYD models. If you’ve got a vehicle you need to sell to help fund your new purchase, you can also sell your car online through Carwow. WhatCar: What Car? says...We'll say one thing about the BYD Dolphin – it'll give people playing I Spy a good way to baffle opponents. After all, who expects to spot a dolphin while they're passing the time on a long motorway journey?But there’s more to this fish-out-of-water story. The Dolphin is a small electric car that sits alongside the BYD Atto 3, the BYD Seal and the BYD Sealion 7 in the Chinese car maker's range of electric vehicles.And while its name is a little quirky, the Dolphin offers something the car industry is striving towards: an affordable way in to electrified motoring. Car brands from China have pretty much nailed it, and we've seen the same ethos applied to the MG4 EV and the GWM Ora 03 (formerly the Funky Cat).BYD Dolphin video reviewBYD gives you a choice of three power outputs and two battery sizes, with the biggest battery and motor giving you enough range to rival the MG4 Long Range and a hot hatch rivalling 0-62mph sprint time.It all sounds very promising, but the big question remains – is this a fitting addition to the electric car market, or will the name just be an anecdote to alleviate boredom on long trips? In other words, is the BYD Dolphin good enough to beat rivals including the Citroën ë-C3 and Hyundai Inster? Read on to find out...",

         "Is the BYD Seal a good car? The BYD Seal is a bit like the kid who joins the school halfway through Year 11 and yet finishes the year as rugby captain, prefect and top of the exam tables. You see, while BYD has only been selling cars in the UK since summer 2023, the Seal is an electric saloon car that displays maturity and ability that you’d expect from a highly established European manufacturer. In fact, in many ways it’s actually an improvement on the Tesla Model 3 and Hyundai Ioniq 6 which constitute its two closest alternatives. Other electric cars you might consider are the Polestar 2 and BMW i4. While BYD may have launched the Sealion 7 and Seal U in the years since, the Seal is still a better car than either. Ignore the slightly odd naming convention for a while, though, and focus for a second on the styling - which is great. The Seal is a similar shape to the Tesla Model 3, being a saloon car with a dropped snout and rounded roofline - but it has more intricate detailing around the headlights and a neat lightbar at the rear. It’s a bit less anonymous than the Tesla without being too glam. On the inside, though, it’s like BYD’s stylists took one look at Tesla’s minimalist approach and simply said ‘no, thank you’. The dashboard is very distinctive as a result, with air vents that seamlessly mould into full-width panels running across the cabin. There are posh quilted seats and a panel of switchgear in the centre. It all feels quite upmarket, if unconventional. BYD Seal: electric range, battery and charging data Range: 323-354 milesEfficiency: 3.4-3.7mi/kWhBattery size: 83kWh Max charge speed: 150kWCharge time DC: 37mins, 10-80%, 150kWCharge port location: Right side rearPower outputs: 313hp / 530hp Even more unconventional is the infotainment screen, which is a huge 15.6-inches across. BYD’s party piece is that the screen physically rotates from portrait to landscape at the touch of a button. The company says this is because things like the sat-nav are better in portrait mode, but as the standard-fit Apple CarPlay and Android Auto only works in landscape you’ll probably leave the rotating trick as a once-in-a-blue-moon showoff rather than a regular feature. The interface isn’t quite as good as you get in a Model 3 or Ioniq 6, either. The BYD Seal’s screen is bright, clear and responsive, but common functions are buried just a few menus too deep with buttons that are too hard to hit on the move. Drivers and front passengers of all sizes will be able to get comfy up front in those squashy, quilted leather seats, and there’s good stowage for smaller items too. The back seats are a bit more of a squeeze, with decent legroom but headroom that’s limited by the huge panoramic glass roof. There’s a lot to like about the Seal, but it’s a shame so many functions go through the touchscreen that’s too hard to use while driving Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Boot space of 402 litres matches the Ioniq 6 but trails the Model 3. There is a handy front boot for storing charge cables, though. Just note that, as a saloon car, the Seal isn’t as practical for large items as a Polestar 2. To drive, the Seal is deeply impressive. Even the standard rear-wheel drive model is quick, but performance from the all-wheel drive, 530hp Excellence version is mind-bending and, unlike a Tesla, totally repeatable. Responsive and accurate steering, plus suspension that strikes a great balance between comfort and cornering, means it’s even a good amount of fun on a twisty road. Competitive range figures of 323 - 354 miles are the icing on the cake, though it’s a shame there’s no super-long range version to challenge the best Tesla Model 3. Still, the BYD Seal is a car that should definitely be on your shortlist. Interested? Check out our best BYD Seal deals here, or get a great price on a BYD Seal lease.

And it has some impressive numbers to help its cause.BYD Seal video reviewFor example, the entry-level version has an official range of more than 350 miles, while the range-topper can accelerate from 0-62mph in less than four seconds.Beyond the Model 3, rivals include the BMW i4, Hyundai Ioniq 6, Polestar 2 and Volkswagen ID 7.

         "Is the BYD Seal U a good car? It’s not immediately obvious what sort of car the BYD Seal U is from the name alone - it sounds like it should be related to the all-electric BYD Seal saloon. However, it’s instead a plug-in hybrid family-sized SUV which majors on value - coming in comfortably cheaper than many much smaller hatchbacks and SUVs. It’s also quite a frustrating car, as it doesn’t do things by halves. In some aspects it’s good - very good, arguably near the top of its class. In others, however, it’s firmly near the bottom, making it difficult to recommend. It’s like buying products from Temu or Aliexpress - they can be very good or very bad, but rarely are they just average. The Seal U is a similar size to plug-in hybrid SUVs such as the Hyundai Tucson, Ford Kuga and Volkswagen Tiguan, but it’s closer in price to cars such as the Kia Niro or Jeep Renegade, both of which are a lot smaller. The closest alternative is the MG HS, which comes in at a similar size and a similar price for its plug-in hybrid variant. The BYD Seal U starts on the back foot because of its design. Whereas BYD’s other cars are at least distinctive if not particularly pretty, the Seal U looks like every other SUV was popped into a blender. It’s so anonymous that it would make the perfect getaway car, but the result is that you don’t feel particularly proud or excited to be climbing aboard. At least you’ll have plenty of room inside. Space in the front and rear seats is excellent, with space for a six-foot passenger to stretch out behind a driver of a similar size. The boot isn’t quite so impressive, at 425 litres in capacity - most alternatives offer more room. It’s still a useful space, though, as it’s deep and wide - just not very tall. The BYD Seal U really isn’t good to drive, but it’s so affordable and decently practical it’s difficult to complain too much Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Those sat up front enjoy loads of tech as standard, and a cabin design that’s rather more distinctive than the exterior styling. You get BYD’s trademark rotating touchscreen infotainment system - 15.6-inches across, it’s huge, clear and responsive, even if the interface doesn’t always make the most sense. Other luxurious features include things like full-cabin air purification, which senses when there are lots of pollutants outside (or even inside) the vehicle and can filter them out. It’s driving the Seal U which highlights its Marmite nature more than anything else. The hybrid powertrain is truly excellent, but the rest of the driving experience is very poor. The Seal U runs on its electric motors most of the time, with the petrol engine acting mostly as a generator and only kicking in fully if you put your foot all the way down. That means progress is smooth, if not hugely rapid, and makes the Seal U fantastic for driving around town. Good range on a charge and a generally quiet cabin free of too much wind and road noise further this aspect. But the Seal U’s suspension is so soft that it wallows over bumps like a ship in rough seas, and the steering is so light that it feels as if you’re driving a remote controlled-car. This is especially a shame given that the Seal saloon with which the Seal U (sort of) shares a name is really good to drive. You can check out the latest BYD Seal U deals through Carwow, or browse used BYD cars from our network of trusted dealers, and when it’s time to sell your current car, Carwow can help with that, too. WhatCar: What Car? says...Seals and petrol are not a great combination in the natural world, but when it comes to cars it can work – as the BYD Seal U shows.Let’s explain. While the BYD Seal is an electric saloon, the Seal U DM-i is a family SUV available exclusively as a petrol plug-in hybrid in the UK. China and some European countries will get a fully electric Seal U but it won't be available with right-hand drive.It’s the first of many PHEVs that BYD is planning to sell here and it looks like the Chinese car maker wants to make a statement.BYD Seal U video reviewIndeed, its electric-only range looks good on paper, its pricing is competitive and its standard equipment list is long. Even entry-level cars get ventilated seats, for example.So how does the BYD Seal U fare in practice against other rival family SUVs, including the Hyundai Tucson and Kia Sportage – not to mention our current favourite PHEV, the MG HS PHEV? Read on to find out…OverviewThe BYD Seal U DM-i has a well-equipped interior, smooth plug-in hybrid system and competitive pricing going for it.

         "Is the BYD Sealion 7 a good car? The BYD Sealion 7 is a roomy electric SUV with sporty looks, impressive specs and a very reasonable price tag - on paper, a brilliant alternative to electric vehicles such as the Tesla Model Y, Kia EV6 or Peugeot E-3008. BYD’s models can be a bit hit and miss, though. The Seal and Dolphin are really good electric cars, but the Seal U plug-in hybrid SUV is rather disappointing. The Sealion 7 is a mixed bag - it's not as outwardly brilliant as the Seal, but it's far better than the Seal U and a credible alternative to the aforementioned Tesla. The Sealion 7 gets off to a reasonable start because while it’s not exactly handsome, it’s a bit less anonymous than the Seal U. BYD’s signature headlight design features C-shape LEDs, sat above a chunky bumper design with big air intakes. A sleek, sloping roofline trails rearward to a tailgate spoiler and a full-width rear lightbar. Inside, things are a bit less lukewarm - it’s genuinely nice inside, with posh-feeling materials swaddling every surface and an interesting dashboard design covered in flowing lines. There’s a huge 15.6-inch infotainment screen with BYD’s trademark rotating party trick - this is cool the first few times, but is likely to be relegated to gimmick status after you’ve shown your mates. BYD Sealion 7: electric range, battery and charging data Range: 283-312 milesBattery size: 82.5kWh / 91.3kWhMax charge speed: 150kW / 230kWCharge time DC: 32mins, 10-80%, 150kW / 24mins, 10-80%, 230kWCharge port location: Right side rearPower outputs: 313hp / 530hp There are some materials that feel a little bit cheap considering that the Sealion 7 isn’t a budget machine, but overall it feels quite premium - even if it’s lacking the wow factor of a Peugeot E-3008. No such caveats when it comes to the space on offer, though. The front seats are big, squashy and comfortable, and the storage solutions for smaller items are useful - but the back seats are huge, so rear passengers will be able to stretch out as much as they’d like. You won’t have any issues fitting lanky teens or bulky child seats back here, though the middle seat backrest is quite uncomfortable so it’s certainly better for two people. At 520 litres in capacity, boot space can’t hold a candle to the Tesla Model Y but it’s pretty good compared with most other alternatives. There’s a deep underfloor storage compartment and even a useful ‘frunk’ where you’d find the engine on a combustion-powered car. If you’re looking for lots of space in the cabin, the BYD Sealion 7 could be appealing, but it’s far from best-in-class in most other areas… Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The Sealion 7 offers a choice of two large battery packs, with a claimed range of between 283-312 miles. That sounds good on paper, but during our testing we saw really poor efficiency which would suggest that even the larger battery will only return a figure in the 200s. Not so good. It is powerful, though, and the motors are smooth and silent, so getting up to speed on the motorway is easy. It’s a shame that the rest of the car isn’t quite as refined - there’s a lot of wind noise and tyre roar. Worse still, the Sealion 7’s suspension feels very unsettled. It bounces a lot over bumps, and you can feel the body moving long after you've passed a road imperfection. It’s like being in a rather unstable ship at sea. On top of this, twitchy and hyperactive steering means it’s not even much fun to drive down a twisting B-road, which is a shame. The Sealion 7 is an interesting left-field choice if you value technology and passenger space, but the alternatives all have more enticing driving dynamics and better range, for less cash.

WhatCar: What Car? says...The name of the BYD Sealion 7 we're reviewing here might seem a bit odd, but then it’s no weirder than an SUV called a Puma or a sports car called a Cayman. Lots of cars are named after animals, so why should pinnipeds be left out?Likewise, the number 7 in the Sealion's name doesn’t really mean anything at the moment. You can't buy it as a seven-seater but it suggests smaller Sealion models might arrive later on.Enough about the name – what exactly is the Sealion 7? Well, it’s an electric SUV and is probably best thought of as a taller, slightly longer take on the BYD Seal. That makes it a direct rival to the big-selling Tesla Model Y as well as the lower-riding and slightly smaller Hyundai Ioniq 5 and Kia EV6.BYD Sealion 7 video reviewSo is the BYD Sealion 7 good enough to take on the best electric SUVs and win?

         "Is the Fiat 500 a good car? The Fiat 500 is perfectly suited to short urban commutes or popping into town. In the same way you wouldn’t wear a miniskirt and heels for climbing Mount Snowdon, and you wouldn’t wear tweeds and brogues to the beach, you wouldn’t buy a 500 for long cross-country schleps. The compact city car is something of a dying breed, but if you’re shopping for a Fiat 500 then you could also consider the Toyota Aygo X, Kia Picanto or the Renault Clio. The little Fiat has all these cars beaten on the style front though, offering a unique splash of retro chic. Things get even funkier inside, where the body-coloured dashboard and optional white steering wheel help lift the ambience nicely. The seats themselves aren’t the comfiest, but there’s plenty of adjustment to help you get a good view out and all the controls are grouped sensibly together so they’re a doddle to use. That said, the Fiat 500’s 7.0-inch touchscreen infotainment system takes a bit of getting used to thanks to the fiddly menus, but you can always use the standard-fit Apple CarPlay or Android Auto instead. Sadly, there isn’t much you can do about the Fiat 500’s cramped seats. Two adults in the front will be fine, but anyone close to six-feet tall will struggle for knee- and headroom in the back, and there isn’t a great deal of space in the Fiat 500’s boot for everyone’s luggage. The Fiat 500 is one of the most fun small cars around – not just for how it looks but also for the sheer number of characterful options you can choose from to make it your own Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer You probably won’t be packing the Fiat 500 with loads of bulky baggage though, will you? More likely you’ll be doing the school run, heading to work or popping to the shops. In these respects, it does a great job. Kids will have no trouble jumping into the back and the Fiat 500’s small size makes it just the thing for nipping through traffic and squeezing into tight parking spaces. Its 1.0-litre mild hybrid petrol engine is best suited to town driving as well, and it’s pretty economical. The great all-round visibility and light steering also help to make light work of tight car parks. Sure, it isn’t the most comfortable small car out there and it’s a bit noisy at speed, but it’ll tackle a twisty country road without much body lean and all models come with cruise control to help make the occasional motorway journey a bit more bearable. It’s just a shame that you can’t get the Fiat 500 with automatic emergency braking. However, you shouldn’t let this put you off if you’re looking for a seriously stylish city car that’s cheap to run, easy to drive and comes with plenty of personalisation options.

         "Is the Fiat 500e a good car? This is the Fiat 500e, a city car with lovable retro-chic looks and an all-electric motor and battery – it's a bit like Greta Thunberg, because it's small and eco friendly. The 500e is a bit bigger and heavier than the petrol 500 that's also still on sale, but it still has diddy dimensions. If you're looking for a small EV there aren't many to choose from – but the Vauxhall Corsa Electric, BYD Dolphin and Peugeot e-208 are all great choices. Rather than add a bunch of fiddly details to the outside, Fiat’s gone back to basics and made the 500 look smoother, more rounded and even more minimalist than before. It’s like your grandad suddenly ditching the dyed comb-over and shaving his head instead. Smoother, simpler, cooler. For starters, the old car’s headlights have been ditched in favour of two semi-circular lamps with curved daytime-running lights that shine out through the bonnet. The flush door handles and hidden indicators are pretty much the only difference you’ll spot from the side, and the lack of an exhaust pipe is a dead giveaway that you’re looking at the new car from behind. OK, so the new Fiat 500e looks pretty similar to the old car on the outside, but it’s a totally different story inside. There’s a brand-new 7.0-inch digital dial display instead of traditional dials, and you get a big 10.25-inch touchscreen on the dashboard with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone mirroring. The physical controls for the heating and air conditioning are grouped together under the central touchscreen and there’s a storage tray where you’d find a gear lever in a petrol- or diesel-powered car. Space in the front is good for two adults and there are decent storage options, but the back seats cater for two only, and they’ll have to be quite small people at that. Fitting a child seat is pretty much impossible, too, while the 500’s boot is good for the weekly shop, but not much else. It is a city car, after all. With compact dimensions and an all-electric powertrain, the Fiat 500e is a superb city car option, even if the range won't take you too far out of it Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The Fiat 500e comes with two battery options – one that offers a 115-mile range and another with a 199-mile range, which isn't great when each of the other alternatives can go comfortably more than 200 miles in official tests. You can recharge your 500 using a three-pin socket, but that’ll take all night – literally. You’ll be better off getting a wallbox to take advantage of AC charging up to 11kW (or 7.4kW if that's the maximum you can get at your house), which will charge the battery in under three hours. The quickest way to charge is using a public fast charger, with the Fiat 500 capable of taking up to 85kW. At these speeds it can go from empty to 80% charged in 35 minutes, and add a useful 30 miles of charge in just five minutes. The Fiat 500 comes with either a 95hp motor that can hustle it from 0-62mph in 9.5 seconds, or a 118hp electric motor with enough poke to accelerate it from 0-62mph in nine seconds. That doesn’t sound particularly fast but the new 500 will do 0-30mph in three seconds, which is nippy in town and faster than most small city cars. Also handy in town is the new 500’s automatic emergency braking that’ll spot pedestrians and cyclists in your path and automatically apply the brakes if it thinks you’re about to hit them. That’s in addition to adaptive cruise control that’ll accelerate and brake for you on motorways to keep you a safe distance from the car ahead. There are three driving modes, Normal, Range and Sherpa. Range mode uses the motor to recharge the batteries when you brake to help boost the Fiat 500’s range, while Normal model tones down this ‘regenerative braking’ effect. The Sherpa function limits the 500’s top speed to 50mph (down from 93mph) and turns off the air conditioning. These extreme measures will be useful in an emergency when you really need to eke out every last mile to reach a charging point. So, the Fiat 500 is now an electric city car, but we think you’ll agree it’s a good one, provided you don’t need lots of space or expect the last word in interior quality.

WhatCar: What Car? says...If it’s retro charm you’re after, not many new cars come close to the chic Fiat 500e. With looks harking back to the Fifties classic of the same name, this all-electric reimagining of the Fiat 500 (Cinquecento in Italy) turns heads like few other cars in its price bracket.This electric 500 (there's also a petrol hybrid version) is available with an official range of up to 199 miles. Fiat also sells a more affordable version aimed at buyers who want to keep costs down and don't plan to travel too far from home. It has a smaller battery and offers up to 118 miles of range.If you go for the version with the bigger battery, you can choose between a regular hardtop roof or the 500e Cabrio convertible version, which has a retractable canvas roof.Fiat 500e video reviewSo, what are the Fiat 500e’s key rivals? Well, most electric cars are pricier and bigger, but they include the Honda e, the Mini Cooper Electric and the Peugeot e-208.

         "Is the Fiat 500C a good car? Inspired by ‘La Dolce Vita’ of warm days in Tuscany or Rome, the Fiat 500C is a convertible small car that has a sliding soft-top and wonderfully retro styling. With only the Mini Convertible and Toyota Aygo X (when it's fitted with a sliding roof) the only true alternatives, the 500C is part of a rare breed – but it’s not going the way of the dodo just yet, with the 500 Electric Convertible taking up the zero-emission mantle. Its style is classic Fiat, with plenty of chrome trim around the main badge and lights matching the throwback looks. The short overhangs, which make it great in town, are matched with more chrome around the back, which has rectangular lights and shows the full extent of the sliding roof. Inside, most of the dashboard features a body-coloured panel to match the outside. That hosts the 7.0-inch touchscreen, the climate controls and a high-mounted gear lever. The steering wheel sits in front of the speedometer, which has the rev counter inside it as well as a small driver information display, which isn’t easy to navigate. Top versions get a 7.0-inch screen behind the wheel, although that isn’t the simplest to use either. You won’t find a lot of cabin space in the 500C. Yes, the driver can get comfortable fairly easily, but if you’re tall you won’t find masses of headroom available. Trying to squeeze adults into the back is very tricky, as you have to fold the front seat forward, then clamber into a space where you’ll find little room. It’s worth splashing the cash and getting the Fiat 500C Top if you want this cute and stylish supermini – even if it’s not the best to live with Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The boot isn’t particularly large either. At 185 litres, it seriously lags behind the boot in the Mini Convertible and Toyota Aygo X, while multiple other small cars top that if you’re not desperate for the sliding roof. Folding the back seats down does open more space, but the boot opening itself is too narrow to fit larger items in. You only get one engine choice with the 500C – a 70hp 1.0-litre three-cylinder petrol engine with a small generator and battery applied to help with fuel economy. That comes with a six-speed manual transmission. The sprint from 0-60mph is more of a jog, taking 13.8 seconds. In town, the keenly revving engine helps you get up to urban speeds quickly enough, while the light steering can be made even lighter by pressing a button on the centre console to make the Fiat more manoeuvrable. The 500C is comfortable enough over bumps and you get a good view around you, but the rear view can be hindered with the roof rolled down. That tiny engine does start to run out of puff when you’re on the motorway though. As it takes so long to get up to speed, you have to make the most out of every gear by revving it close to the red line. It is also quite noisy at higher speeds, with wind and road noise glaringly obvious. If you’re in an Abarth 695C – a tricked-out Fiat 500 – twisty roads are a lot of fun. Not so much in the Fiat 500C. You feel like you might topple over if you take a corner too quickly, and the steering does not give you a great sense of how much grip your front tyres have. While the Fiat 500C offers a lot for those wanting to enjoy sunnier weather when driving around town, there are sacrifices that need to be made –. it’s not that practical for its size and isn’t refined when you need to go on a longer journey, with a Mini Convertible or Toyota Aygo X being more accomplished overall.

         "Is the Fiat 500X a good car? The Fiat 500X isn’t a bad choice if you’re looking for a small, stylish SUV and find yourself put off by the bland looks of the SEAT Arona or the stodgy drive offered by the Citroen C3 Aircross. The 500X was launched in 2014 and – to help it keep pace with the SEAT and Citroen – got a facelift in 2018. Changes included an updated interior, a new infotainment system, extra safety kit and a couple of new petrol engines. The diesels from the old model have been dropped. In terms of exterior styling, only the lights have changed – you now get new daytime running lights and rear LEDs – so you’ll struggle to tell the difference between the old car and this 2018 model. You can also choose from two exterior (rather optimistically coined) ‘body styles’ – Urban Look, which has conventional body coloured bumpers or Cross Look which has chunkier bumpers with mock skid plates. The interior gets the same retro look as the outside, the large swathe of body-coloured plastic that runs across the dashboard gives the 500X a playful feel that’s missing from the dingy SEAT Arona. But, while the 2018 500X gets a new instrument binnacle and a new steering wheel, its interior plastics look cheap in places, particularly in the back, and its switches and buttons are a little flimsy. The 500X looks like a cutesy Fiat 500 that's been blown up like a balloon and given a pair of extra doors Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The infotainment system has also been updated but doesn’t have the clear graphics or ease of use you get in the SEAT’s system. You do, however, get Apple CarPlay and Android Auto as standard in the Fiat, so it is easy to use your smartphone’s apps on the car’s 7.0-inch screen. Up front, there’s plenty of space to get comfy even if you’re tall and someone of a similar size should be able to squeeze behind you, too. The Fiat has a slightly smaller boot than its aforementioned alternatives, but it is easy to load and has space for a couple of large suitcases. Filled to the brim with people and stuff, the 500X’s otherwise nippy 120hp petrol engine isn’t going to feel quick, but it’s still the engine to go for because the quicker 150hp 1.3-litre model’s standard automatic gearbox is frustratingly slow to change which blunts acceleration. It’s a shame the more powerful engine is spoiled because there’s not much wrong with the way the 500X drives. In town, you can zip in and out of gaps in traffic, while at faster speeds there’s not too much body lean to worry about and the Fiat’s weighty steering makes it easy to place in bends. On the motorway, the suspension smooths out bumps better than it does at slower speeds, although the cabin does suffer from a fair amount of wind noise.

         "Is the Fiat 600 a good car? The Fiat 600 is a bit like a designer handbag you buy because of its stylish looks, but when you get it home you find you can barely fit anything inside. That’s because while the 600’s retro-inspired looks will certainly turn heads, alternatives are much more spacious. And there are alternatives aplenty, from the chic Renault Captur to the rugged Dacia Duster, smart Volkswagen T-Cross and ultra-efficient Toyota Yaris Cross. You could even consider the bigger, plug-in hybrid MG HS, which isn’t a great leap in price. Yet while most of those cars look good in their own way, none is quite as funky as the 600. Sure, it’s not as effortlessly cool as the smaller Fiat 500, but it’s not a bad effort and wears its curves well. That curvy theme continues inside, with a large oval dashboard that, on the base trim, is painted the same shade as the exterior, which works particularly well if you opt for one of the brighter colours. However, there are cheap materials aplenty, and the floppy cover for the central storage bin is just… odd. Space is pretty good for those in the front though, with plenty of places to store bits and bobs, but that’s where the practicality ends. The rear seats are tight and the boot, at 385 litres is smaller than most alternatives offer. The Captur offers up to a massive 616 litres if you slide the rear seats forward. Alternatives offer more space, but if you’re looking for a slightly roomier upgrade from the 500 then the 600 is an intriguing option Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The infotainment system has sharp enough graphics, but navigating its menus and finding various settings is unintuitive. You can at least bypass most of this with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, which come as standard – and you’ll need to in the base model, because there’s no built-in navigation. Although Fiat markets the 600 engine as a ‘hybrid’, neither of the two engine choices are a proper self-charging or plug-in unit, so you won’t be cruising around town on electric power watching your MPGs skyrocket. However, it’s very effective at engaging electricity at lower speeds or when decelerating, so it’s relatively efficient – 50mpg is achievable – and smooth to drive around town. If all-electric motoring appeals you might consider the Fiat 600e instead. The diminutive footprint might not be great for space but it does mean the 600 is a doddle to drive in the city, particularly if you’re stepping up from the smaller 500. The suspension handles bumps well even at higher speeds, meaning motorway trips are nothing to fear. It’s anything but exciting to drive, though.

         "Is the Fiat 600e a good car? The Fiat 500e is a great city car, but what if you need a bit more space? Step forward the Fiat 600e - the Italian firm’s small, fully-electric SUV. It captures some of the charm and style that’s made the 500 so popular, but stretches it across a bigger body with much more interior room and - importantly - five doors. Think of it like the 500’s older sibling. It’s not quite as cute to look at as the baby of the family, and might not get as much attention - but it’s a lot more useful when you need a helping hand. The 600e may be bigger than the 500 but it’s still pretty small by SUV standards. Compared with alternatives such as the Peugeot e-2008, MG ZS EV or Carwow Car of the Year-winning Volvo EX30, it’s quite a bit smaller. It’s more like a jacked-up hatchback, having a similar footprint but higher roofline than cars such as the Vauxhall Corsa Electric. Those tiny dimensions mean the 600e is fantastic for driving and parking in cramped towns and cities, and if you’re upgrading from a 500 it won’t feel intimidating or too bulky. Despite this, interior space is pretty good. The front seats have loads of room, and while the back seats are a bit too cramped for adults to get very comfortable they’re plenty spacious enough for a couple of child seats. Fiat 600e: electric range, battery and charging data Range: 254 milesEfficiency: 4.7mi/kWhBattery size: 54kWhMax charge speed: 100kWCharge time AC: 7hrs 45 mins, 7kWCharge time DC: 27 mins, 20-80%, 100kWCharge port location: Rear leftPower outputs: 154hp You do pay for that with the boot space, however, which at 360 litres is larger than most electric hatchbacks but smaller than just about every other comparable electric SUV. Inside, there’s quite a lot to like. The 600e shares many of its components with its close sibling, the Jeep Avenger Electric, but adds in a dose of Italian style familiar to those who’ve sat in a 500. There’s a swooping shape to the dashboard and some shiny trim, plus a pleasing round housing over the instrument cluster. It’s quite a trim-dependent interior, though, with posh La Prima cars getting light-coloured upholstery and trim that really lifts the cabin - while the darker trim of entry-level cars looks and feels a little cheap. There’s plenty of storage space with big door bins and adjustable cupholders, but the fabric flap that covers the central storage bin is just plain annoying. The infotainment system is Fiat’s latest, and it’s based on a very wide but quite shallow display. It can be a bit awkward to use, and a little jerky to flick between menus - but the screen itself is high-res and the wireless smartphone connectivity works perfectly well, allowing you to bypass Fiat’s own system if you want to. The Fiat 600e is a characterful electric SUV that's great to drive in the city – and it's good value, too Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer There’s also a nice set of physical climate controls, which is much easier to operate on the move than having to head into a display sub-menu just to adjust the temperature. On the road, the 600e is genuinely impressive especially considering its price. It soaks up bumps as well as any of its alternatives, and can make some much more expensive cars feel positively uncomfortable in comparison. Dealing effortlessly with speed bumps and bad roads, plus super-light steering and good visibility means the Fiat 600e is a fantastic EV to drive around town. It’s comfortable on longer trips, too, though it doesn’t feel quite as stable and tied down as some alternatives and there’s a bit more noise on the motorway. The 600e is available with just one motor and battery option at the moment. It officially offers 254 miles of range from a pretty modest battery capacity, and in our tests it proved impressively efficient - resulting in a real-world range of about 200 miles. Public charging from 20-80% takes less than half an hour, which is par for the course. If you’re not ready to make the switch to electric just yet, there's also a hybrid 600. So the Fiat 600e is a decent small electric SUV overall – it’s a bit cheap inside and not hugely practical, but it’s packed full of character and is comfortable to drive around town. It’s priced temptingly, too. Interested? Check out the latest Fiat 600e deals available through Carwow.

         "Is the Fiat Panda a good car? It might not have the retro looks of the Fiat 500, but the Panda is stylish. Its upright body means there’s plenty of room inside and all models come with five doors for great access. Interior quality might not be up to the standards of a Volkswagen Up, but it’s fair to say that Fiat has harnessed a decent amount of charm. The Panda feels at its best in the city, where its small dimensions make it perfect for weaving through congested streets and squeezing into tight parking spaces. Small engines mean the Panda is also cheap to run, but not best-suited to fast-moving motorway traffic, where it can feel a little out of breath. There are two body styles available. The first is the regular Panda, which is available on the base trim and looks like a typical city car. You also have the Cross, which can be found on the three other trims, called Red, Garmin and Top. This has some extra body cladding and other rugged-looking features that give it some baby off-roader style. The Fiat Panda is a quirky small car that's affordable but above all else fun Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Pandas are cheap cars, which means standard equipment is pretty basic and includes items such as central locking, six airbags, a CD player and power steering that can be lightened at the touch of a button. Overall, the Fiat Panda is a charming and well-sorted small car that has plenty of appealing traits. The space on offer is quite impressive for such tiny dimensions, it’s cheap to buy and run and is abundant in style and character. There are a few rough edges here and there, and rivals such as the Kia Picanto and Volkswagen Up are very tempting alternatives to the funky Fiat. However, the Panda has a lot going for it, and is a much more capable all-rounder than the alternatives. It’s definitely worth considering if you’re in the market for such a car, so why not check out our Fiat Panda deals to see how much you could save? Or you could find a great deal on a used Fiat Panda from our network of trusted dealers, as well as browsing other used Fiats. When the time comes to sell your car, carwow can help with that, too.",

         "Is the Fiat Panda 4x4 a good car? The Fiat Panda 4×4 is a compact city car that’ll take the odd off-road excursion in its stride. It’s just as easy to live with as the standard Panda but comes with a grippy four-wheel-drive system that makes it a worthy alternative to the likes of the Suzuki Jimny and Dacia Duster 4×4. Inside, however, the Fiat Panda 4×4 comes with a much more stylish cabin than the unapologetically basic Suzuki. The dials, heating controls and even the centre of the steering wheel come with a squared-off circular design (should that be squircular?) and you can choose from a selection of camouflage olive, beige and brown trims for the dashboard. Less worthy of praise, however, is the Fiat Panda 4×4’s infotainment system. Rather than a slick touchscreen like you get as standard in many other small SUVs (including the Suzuki Jimny) you’ll have to make do with a back-to-basics stereo and CD player with an old-fashioned orange and black display. Fiat’s UConnect app lets you use some of your smartphone’s features while you’re driving, but it’s nowhere near as intuitive as the more commonplace Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone mirroring systems you’ll find in many alternatives. So, the Fiat Panda 4×4 doesn’t have a particularly high-tech cabin, but at least it’s relatively spacious for such a small car. Its tall body means there’s enough headroom in both the front and rear seats for adults to get comfy, but those in the back will be left wishing there was slightly more leg room – especially on long journeys. It’s a similar story when you take a look at the Fiat Panda 4×4’s boot. Its 225-litre capacity is big enough for a weekly shop but significantly smaller than the space you get in the likes of the less off-road focussed SEAT Arona and Renault Captur. Unlike most so-called off-roaders, the Fiat Panda 4x4 is perfectly capable of hauling you and three friends over deeply rutted fields and up snowy hills without breaking a sweat Mat Watson Carwow expert Also smaller than in many alternatives is the Fiat Panda 4×4’s diminutive 0.9-litre petrol engine. It might only have two cylinders, but it packs a fairly decent 85hp punch so it doesn’t feel too sluggish. It’ll accelerate from 0-62mph in a reasonable 12.1sec, and Fiat claims it’ll return 57.6mpg – although you’ll probably see a figure closer to 45mpg in normal driving conditions. There’s also a 1.3-litre diesel you should consider if you do lots of motorway miles. It’s not as fast as the petrol, but it uses less fuel and it’s slightly quieter when you’re cruising along. Not that the Fiat Panda 4×4 feels particularly at home whizzing along at 70mph, that is. It’s much more adept nipping through town where its small size and relatively large windows make it a doddle to manoeuvre and easier to park than the larger Dacia Duster. The Fiat Panda 4×4 is pretty comfortable to drive over poorly maintained roads, too, and it doesn’t lean a great deal in tight corners – despite its jacked-up suspension that makes it taller than the standard Panda. Head off-road, and the Fiat Panda 4×4’s special tyres and four-wheel drive mean it’ll happily traipse through mud that’d leave most two-wheel-drive SUVs well and truly stuck. It doesn’t have quite the same boulder-traversing abilities as the Suzuki Jimny, but it’ll prove more than capable of dealing with a few inches of snow or a heavily rutted field. Unfortunately, the Fiat Panda 4×4 there is a fly in the ointment The Panda Cross – with which the 4×4 shares many components – earned a mediocre three-star safety rating when it was crash-tested by Euro NCAP in 2015. If, however, you’re looking for a cheap, cheerful 4×4 that won’t cost the earth to run you should still consider the Fiat Panda 4×4 – especially if you actually plan to use it off-road.",

         "Is the Fiat Panda Cross a good car? The Fiat Panda Cross is a chunky little hatchback that could be your ideal compact off-roader if you fancy something small and easy to drive but live somewhere prone to bouts of harsh winter weather. Unlike the Suzuki Jimny, the Fiat Panda Cross isn’t a thoroughbred 4×4 – as its name suggests, it’s based on the humble Panda hatchback. Peel away the Cross’ angrier bodywork, however, and you’ll find a neat four-wheel-drive system that means it’ll keep up with the Suzuki long after many more expensive SUVs have got themselves well and truly stuck. Its huge plastic bumpers and silver door protectors aren’t just for show, either – they’ll help make sure the Fiat Panda Cross’ bodywork springs back into shape should you have an altercation with a particularly solid piece of the countryside. It even comes with two tow hooks front and back so you can use the Panda’s off-road prowess to rescue other motorists caught in a sudden snowstorm – if you feel like it, that is. This rugged utilitarian theme continues in the Fiat Panda Cross’ cabin – only here it’s less appealing. Sure, the square instruments look pretty funky and the contrasting silver slab and copper-effect dashboard add a splash of colour, but the plastics all feel hard and scratchy and you don’t get a great deal of equipment as standard. The Fiat Panda Cross is fun little 4x4 that’ll plug its way through terrain that’d see many bigger SUVs stranded but, if you’ll just use it to potter around town, get a standard Panda Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer So, it might not feel all that plush inside, but at least the Fiat Panda Cross’ cabin is pretty roomy. There’s loads of headroom in the front (although a height-adjustable driver’s seat doesn’t come as standard on entry-level cars) and three kids will have plenty of space to stretch out in the back. A Dacia Duster as more space for tall adults, though, as well as a more practical boot than the diminutive Fiat Panda Cross. The Dacia’s engines aren’t quite as economical as the Fiat’s, though. You can get the Panda Cross with either a city-friendly 0.9-litre two-cylinder petrol or a more powerful 1.2-litre four-cylinder that’ll be better if you plan on doing long motorway journeys or any kind of serious off-roading. If you plan to stick to the asphalt, though, you’ll find the Fiat Panda Cross feels very similar to the standard Panda – that’s to say it’s a doddle to manoeuvre in town, easy to park and even reasonably comfortable. It’s not particularly spritely – whichever engine you pick – and it leans a fair amount in tight corners, though not enough to make passengers feel ill. What it lacks, though, is any kind of advanced safety kit, such as the automatic emergency braking feature you get in a Suzuki Jimny. That being said, the more affordable Fiat is still a charming compact off-roader that’s well worth a second look.

         "Is the Fiat Qubo a good car? The Fiat Qubo is a small MPV with a roomy interior and a very practical boot. If you’re searching for a bigger alternative to a small hatchback and don’t fancy an SUV, this funky-looking, boxy car could be the answer. If the Fiat Qubo will likely remind you of a small van with windows, that’ll be because it uses plenty of the same mechanical bits and bobs as the Italian firm’s smallest commercial vehicle. As a result, it doesn’t have quite the same street-cred as an equally tall and boxy SUV, but you won’t have any trouble finding it in a crowded supermarket car park. The Fiat Qubo’s interior carries on the theme set out by its boxy exterior. The dashboard is pretty plain, save for a few silver plastic panels, but at least the knobs for the heating and the buttons for the stereo are easy to reach. It doesn’t feel as plush or as solid as many similarly priced hatchbacks, however, and you can’t add any colour to the Qubo’s pretty drab interior with any posher trims or colourful inserts. Almost every surface feels hard and brittle too, but at least you get a rubber floor as standard which is a doddle to keep clean. This form-over-function approach runs right the way through the Fiat Qubo’s cabin. There are acres of headroom, the front doors open nice and wide and the back doors slide rather than swing open so it’s easy for passengers to climb in – even in tight parking spaces. If you’re looking for an unashamedly practical box on wheels, the budget-minded Fiat Qubo makes a good choice. Just don’t expect it to win any admiring glances… Mat Watson Carwow expert Once inside, they’ll find there’s loads of legroom to stretch out – even if they’re tall and sit behind a six-foot driver. The three back seats are all equally wide so you can carry three adults at once without anyone fighting over who has to sit in the middle seat. If no-one’s tagging along for the ride you can flip the back seats forward and use the Fiat Qubo to carry absolutely masses of luggage. The boot’s wide and square and comes without any kind of load lip so it’s dead easy to slide in some heavy furniture. You can even fold the front passenger seat forward to carry really long items. With the back seats in place, the Qubo can carry about the same amount as a small family hatchback such as the Skoda Fabia. Speaking of which, the Fiat Qubo feels remarkably like a conventional hatchback to drive – despite its boxy shape and tall body. Sure, you’d never call it fun, but it irons out bumps reasonably well around town and doesn’t lean excessively on twisty roads. You can get the Fiat Qubo with one petrol and one diesel engine. Neither are particularly gutsy, but the latter’s your best bet if you spend any length of time on the motorway while the petrol will suit inner-city drivers better. You can’t get the Qubo with any particularly clever safety feature like you can in most small hatchbacks or SUVs, but when it comes to outright load-carrying ability, this quirky van-based MPV offers decent value for money.

         "Is the Fiat Tipo a good car? The Fiat Tipo is available with a choice of two petrol and two diesel engines in five different power outputs. The entry-level 1.3-litre diesel model comes with a five-speed manual gearbox while larger engines benefit from a six-speed manual. A six-speed automatic gearbox is offered on 1.6-litre petrol and diesel cars and Fiat has announced a dual-clutch version will be available in the near future. Its interior is a departure from the retro-inspired Fiat 500 range and focuses instead on basic functionality and occupant comfort. The rear seats have an impressive amount of legroom and the tall rear roofline provides decent headroom. As a result, three six-foot tall passengers can sit in the back for shorter journeys. Standard equipment on entry-level cars might disappoint some customers although a seven-inch touchscreen infotainment system with Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and sat nav is available on higher-spec models. The 440-litre boot is more spacious than those in the Nissan Pulsar (350 litres) and Renault Megane (384 litres) but lags behind the Skoda Octavia's capacious 600-litre load bay. The rear seat bases can be flipped forward allowing the seat backs to be folded completely flat and the lack of discernible load lip makes loading heavy or bulky items easy, too. The Tipo is a reasonably priced car that needs more than that to be competitive in this end of the market Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The Fiat Tipo does a good job of blending cheap running costs with impressive practicality and a reasonably refined ride in a distinctive and sharply-styled package. The selection of engines on offer might be sparing, but two efficient diesels and a number of rev-happy petrols should mean there’s a Tipo to suit the needs of most potential customers.

         "Is the MG4 XPower a good car? This is the MG4 XPower, and it’s a bit like a supermarket's own-brand vindaloo – packing plenty of heat at a value price. It’s a car you’d consider if you’ve been waiting for the dawn of the electric hot hatch, but the higher-power variants of the Cupra Born or Volkswagen ID3 just don’t offer enough punch for you. Not that the looks of the XPower would suggest it’s the exciting version – not a great deal of change has been made over the base MG4. Orange brake callipers and new 18-inch wheels give the game away if you know what you’re looking for, as do a few polished trim pieces, but the bodywork is otherwise untouched. The stealthy vibe may appeal, but there’s a case to be made that MG could and should have done more to shout about the car’s performance. Similarly, there’s very little difference inside compared with the standard MG4. Aside from some Alcantara seat and door inserts, as well as a touch of red stitching, there’s nothing to scream XPower here. Material quality continues to impress for the price, but a dull selection of colours and a basic design does nothing to add to the excitement the car’s power promises. Drag race: Lamborghini Gallardo v MG4 XPower v Nissan GT-R Also retained for the XPower is the 10.25-inch infotainment system, packed with sat nav along with support for Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. A few welcome quality-of-life improvements have been made to the software, as well as a basic ‘Track Mode’ app that gives you real-time access to G-force and acceleration data. As with the base MG4, rear passenger space is impressive, with a decent amount of head and legroom even for taller adults. Boot space is also untouched at 363 litres, which is marginally behind the Volkswagen ID3’s 385 litres. The big changes for the MG4 XPower lie under the skin. As well as more power for the rear motor, a second motor has been added to the front axle too, combining to produce 435hp and 600Nm of torque. The result is 0-60mph in a mind-boggling 3.8 seconds (for context, that’s quicker than a Porsche 911 Carrera 4) and an increased top speed of 124mph. It’s not just the off-the-line performance that’s so impressive either, with a real gut-punching kick from 30-70mph too. To help cope with that extra power, MG has made some mechanical tweaks as well. An electronic locking differential has been added alongside a torque vectoring system, which combine to manage how power is distributed to the wheels through corners. The suspension is the same as the base MG4, though with new tuning for the springs and dampers. MG has made the 'Volkswagen ID3 R' that never was. This is a hauntingly fast EV, but it’s not one to excite you outside of a straight-line sprint Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Though the result is a car that’s certainly capable when you throw it through the bends, it’s not particularly involving. Dull steering makes it difficult to feel how much grip the front wheels have, and even the mechanical upgrades can’t hide the fact this is quite a heavy car. You may outrun a Honda Civic Type R or Hyundai i30 N, but you won’t have as much fun in the twisty stuff. On top of that, because of the suspension tweaks, the MG4 XPower crashes over bumps in the road more so than the regular car, though otherwise remains pretty comfortable around town. At motorway speeds though, you do really notice the wind noise as well as a slight whine from the new front motor. Official range figures from the 64kWh battery dip from 270 miles in the Long Range car to 239 miles for this sporty XPower model. A mixed driving route with the car for this test returned 2.9 miles/kWh, equating to around 185 miles of real-world range. For stomach-churning, sports-car troubling performance at a value price, the MG4 XPower delivers big. That said, traditional hot hatch buyers may struggle to be won over by quite a muted driving experience beyond the numbers. Looking to make this electric hot hatch your next car?

This is the MG5 EV, and it’s one of very few electric estate cars currently available in the UK – the others being the Porsche Taycan Sport Turismo, Vauxhall Astra Sports Tourer Electric and Peugeot e-308 SW. It’s a bit like doing your shopping at Lidl or Aldi. On the face of things, you may dismiss the MG5 as simply being a value option - but if you’re clued up, you’ll know there’s much more to it than that. The MG5 was given a design overhaul in 2022 and it was much-needed, though it also came with a small bump in price. The dowdy car of old has been replaced with a stylish new look, sporting sharp lines in the bumpers and wide, narrow headlights. It’s not quite as striking as the Carwow 2023 Car of the Year, the MG4 hatch, though. On the inside, the MG5 isn’t quite as smart either, but it’s a definite improvement over the pre-revision car. Build quality is really good and there’s a respectable amount of plush-feeling materials. Fabric seats come as standard, though range-topping models get a leatherette set. Sitting at the heart of the dashboard is an updated 10.25-inch infotainment system. It’s certainly a leap from the older, sluggish screen and, if you’d rather mirror your smartphone, it comes with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay as standard. It does retain a part-digital, part-analogue driver’s display, though this feels pretty clunky and would work better as a fully digital unit. Updates have made the MG5 EV much more attractive, but it’s a shame a little price rise came too Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer There’s lots of knee and headroom in the back seats of the MG5, however a raised footwell does leave your rear passengers angled rather awkwardly. As for boot space, you’ve got 580 litres to work with in the MG5. That’s only slightly down on the Toyota Corolla Touring Sports’ 598 litres, so it’s a useful space that will easily carry large suitcases. Choosing the motor and battery is easy, because, well, there is no choice. Whichever MG5 trim you choose you get a battery with a usable capacity of 57kWh and a 156hp motor. That said, driving range is 250 miles in the entry-level SE version or 235 miles in the higher-spec Trophy model, thanks largely to the bigger alloy wheels. The MG5 is comfortable in town and on the motorway, and you get the MG Pilot safety system as standard, which includes assistance kit such as adaptive cruise control and lane-keep assist.

Unfortunately, some of the MG’s penny-pinching is all too obvious, such as the brittle interior plastics and second-rate infotainment system. From the outside, the MG GS looks more like a jacked-up hatchback than most family SUVs. It sports all the black plastic bumper trims you’d expect of a chunky pseudo-off-roader, but the MG GS’ curvy bumpers, slim brake lights and raked roofline look sportier than the comparatively boxy Kia Sportage and Hyundai Tucson. Unfortunately, the MG GS’ interesting exterior only serves to show how dull and drab its interior is. It’s neatly laid out and all the buttons are grouped together so they’re easy to reach, but almost every surface comes with a hard plastic finish and the optional brushed-metal effect trims don’t feel anywhere near as robust as they look. You can have contrasting inserts fitted to the dashboard and doors, but these do little to spruce up the GS’ interior. Equally middling is the touchscreen infotainment system. It’s easy to read but nowhere near as intuitive as the systems you get in most alternatives. What it loses out in technology, the GS claws back (albeit only slightly) in terms of practicality. There’s just as much room in the front seats as you get in the likes of the Nissan Qashqai and there’s more space for carrying three adults at once in the back. The MG GS might appeal if you’re looking for something practical and likely to stand out, but it isn’t particularly good to drive and doesn’t feel as well built as most other family SUVs. Mat Watson Carwow expert It’s a similar story when you need to load the MG GS’ boot. It’s bigger than the Nissan’s and there’s no load lip which makes it easy to slide in heavy boxes. You can fold the back seats down if you need to carry seriously bulky stuff, such as a bike. It’s a shame you can’t get the MG GS with a diesel engine to help you carry very heavy luggage or tow a trailer, though. Instead, it comes with a 1.5-litre 166hp petrol unit. At least it feels fairly spritely and trundles along at motorway speeds relatively quietly – if not particularly economically. Head off the motorway and you’ll find the MG GS doesn’t feel particularly relaxing to drive. Its suspension is firmer than in the likes of the Nissan Qashqai so you’ll feel more of a thud each time you hit a pothole around town. At least you get a decent view out and the optional automatic gearbox you can get in top-spec models means you don’t have to make endless gear changes in heavy traffic. Unlike most SUVs, you can’t get the GS with automatic emergency braking, lane-keeping assistance or driver tiredness detection. As a result, you’ll be better off looking elsewhere if safety is your number one priority. But, if you’re after a sporty-looking yet practical SUV on a shoestring budget, it could be worth a look.

         "Is the MG HS a good car? The MG HS has at points been the best-selling car in the UK and it’s easy to see why. It’s a big, practical family SUV with a posh-looking interior, loads of standard equipment and a headline-grabbing plug-in hybrid engine option - but it costs about as much as most small hatchbacks. While the old HS was definitely in the ‘cheap but not very cheerful’ category, the new model actually feels like something you wouldn’t mind driving around - it has redeeming features other than its price tag. It’s a bit like a Harvester - nobody’s ever going to look at it as a high-end option, but if you’re looking to feed the whole family on a budget, it’s tasty enough that you don’t feel punished for your penny-pinching. The HS is a similar size to family SUVs such as the Ford Kuga, Kia Sportage and Nissan Qashqai - but with its low price tag, you might consider it on the same shortlist as much smaller SUVs such as the Volkswagen T-Cross or Ford Puma. Two more direct alternatives are the Citroen C5 Aircross or BYD Seal U - both big SUVs that put affordability first, and have plug-in hybrid engines available. If your main concern is space for the money, the MG HS is a great option. Despite a price tag close to something like a Volkswagen Polo hatchback, it has space in the back for a six-foot adult to stretch out, plus a 507-litre boot that’ll accommodate the whole family’s kit and clobber. Still remarkably cheap but now much more capable - the MG HS is now a car I could recommend for more than just its price tag Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer You also get a dashboard that looks pretty posh, with a dual-screen setup just like you get on a BMW X3. You don’t have to press very far to find out where MG’s saved money, though, and materials and build quality aren’t really up to the standards of more expensive cars. It’s also not the easiest to use, with very few physical switches, an awkward touchscreen interface and not much storage for smaller items. As far as engines go, there’s a choice of two. You can have a bog-standard petrol, available with manual or automatic gearboxes - these are the more affordable options, and though they’re not particularly offensive to drive they are a bit thirsty. The headline-grabber is the HS plug-in hybrid, which can do up to 75 miles on a charge. That figure is up there with the best PHEVs on sale, and it gives you tons of flexibility - it’s enough to do even the longest of commutes without troubling the petrol engine once. It also nudges the HS into the lowest-but-one band for Benefit-in-Kind tax, making it hundreds of pounds a month cheaper than the equivalent Kia Sportage or Ford Kuga for company car drivers. Both of those cars are better to drive, mind you - they steer more sweetly and handle bumps better, as well as being more responsive and reassuring in the corners. The gap is narrower if you’re just cruising round town or on the motorway, though, where the HS is impressively refined and difficult to dislike. If the new MG HS seems like the SUV for you, check out our best MG HS deals on Carwow. You can see our other MG deals here, or search for a used MG for sale here. And remember, Carwow can even help you sell your old car. WhatCar: What Car? says...The MG HS we're reviewing here is a world away from the two-seaters MG found fame with – but that's not been a bad thing for the car maker's bottom line.Since the original HS was launched, this family SUV has sold in big numbers, and MG has now launched a new version. You might remember that the HS was restyled not long ago, but as you can see from the photos, this time the changes are more radical.As well as a new look, the HS has been given an updated infotainment system, more standard equipment and the choice of either a regular petrol or a petrol plug-in hybrid (PHEV) engine. MG has also confirmed that a regular hybrid version is just around the corner, bringing a potentially happy medium between the two current engine options.MG HS video reviewSo can the latest MG HS match a Ford Kuga or Mazda CX-5 for sportiness, or the Citroën C5 Aircross and Kia Sportage for practicality?

         "Is the MG4 EV a good car? MG pulled an absolute blinder with the MG4, and much like the lovable underdog in a boxing movie it punches well above its weight division. It’s more affordable than alternatives such as the Renault Megane E-Tech and Cupra Born, costing around the same as the smaller Vauxhall Corsa Electric and Fiat 500e. You’d be forgiven for thinking that MG have taken a ‘cheap and cheerful’ approach to engineering the MG4, but that’s far from the truth. So far from it, in fact, that the MG4 received high commendations in the 2024 Carwow Car of the Year Awards’ Outstanding EV and Urban Living categories. Just look at it, a mix of pointy details, sharp creases and funky shapes such as the lower body cladding and split roof spoiler. It’s a refreshing looking thing; it still stands out against newer MGs such as the MG S5 and MG HS as much as it does its alternatives. MG4 EV: electric range, battery and charging data Range: 218-331 milesEfficiency: 3.6-3.8 miles per kWhBattery size: 51kWh / 62kWh / 74kWhMax charge speed: 150kWCharge time AC: 6hrs 12mins, 10-100%, 7kW / 7hrs 30mins, 10-100%, 7kW / 9hrs, 10-100%, 7kWCharge time DC: 39mins, 10-80%, 150kW / 35mins, 10-80%, 150kWCharge port location: Left rearPower outputs: 170hp / 204hp / 245hp It’s a shame the interior isn’t quite as novel, with a dashboard layout that’s so simple it verges on boring, but the material quality, fit and finish and standard kit is better than you might expect for the price. A 10.25-inch infotainment display comes as standard on all trim levels of the MG4, and though it comes with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, MG’s own software is rather basic. It’s frustrating to operate too, especially on the move, with too many menus to navigate. There’s plenty of room in the MG4 though; plenty of adjustability for you to get comfy behind the wheel and enough head and leg room for tall passengers in the rear - though it’s a bit of a squeeze when you’ve got three in the back. The 363-litre boot capacity trails the Volkswagen ID3 for space, and puts it well behind the Megane E-Tech. The MG4 comes with two battery options, offering 218 claimed miles of range in its most basic trim through to 323 miles for the Trophy Extended Range model. The top-rung MG4 XPower, which we’ve reviewed separately, offers a big power hike over the rest of the trim levels, but makes do with a 239-mile range. MG has fully injected its own personality into the MG4 EV, and it leaves you wanting to get to know it a lot more… Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Around town the MG4 is easy to potter about in thanks to its light steering, peppy electric motors and most importantly, its comfortable suspension. It takes potholes, speed bumps and cracked roads in its stride, and the same applies to motorways where the MG4 just soaks up the miles with ease. Yet even with its soft suspension the MG4 is rather fun to drive on a twisty road, feeling agile and grippy with little in the way of body lean. The X-Power is particularly rapid, but it’s different enough that we've reviewed it separately here. For a stonking value for money proposition, have a look at our new MG4 deals as well as our MG4 lease deals. You can also check out used MG4s from our network of trusted dealers as well as other used MGs. When it’s time for a change, you can even sell your current car through Carwow. WhatCar: What Car? says...Think electric cars are too expensive? Well, the MG4 EV is actually cheaper than many petrol or hybrid equivalents.In fact, it's cheaper even than the other electric car offerings from MG – the MG5 EV and the MG ZS EV – both of which are famously value-focused in their own right.Surely, then, the bargain-basement pricing (in electric car terms, at least) must mean the MG4 has a tiny range between charges, a cramped interior and not much equipment on offer? Well, that's what we'll be finding out in this review.MG4 video reviewRivals range from the Citroën ë-C3 and Cupra Born to the Fiat 500e and Renault Megane E-Tech. Plus, you might consider some less-familiar models, including the BYD Dolphin, the Ora 03 (previously the Ora Funky Cat) and the Hyundai Inster.Read on to find out how the MG4 EV compares with the best electric cars...OverviewDespite an influx of cheaper rivals, the MG4 EV remains excellent value – especially if you choose the entry-level SE trim with the smallest battery.

         "Is the MG3 a good car? The MG3 used to be a bit of a joke - the old one was the lowest-ranked car on Carwow - but the new model aims to change all that. Now, instead of being antiquated, it’s right up there with the best small cars for performance, efficiency and equipment. Like an air fryer from the middle of Lidl, the MG3’s feature set is as good as any of its alternatives and it’s not immediately clear where the money’s been saved to bring it in at such a low price. Now that it’s a full self-charging hybrid car, the MG3 no longer targets the very cheapest on the market like the Dacia Sandero or Citroen C3 Origin. Instead, it’s more like a cut-price alternative to the Renault Clio E-Tech or Toyota Yaris - a halfway house for people who want the most efficient small car possible, but either don’t want or can’t have a fully electric model. The MG3 won’t win awards for its practicality - it’s not cramped, but it’s no better than average in this regard with a boot that’s about halfway between the Yaris and the Clio in capacity. Rear seat space is moderate, too, though annoyingly the rear seats don’t split when they fold which does limit overall versatility. The front of the cabin looks great, and very modern - in stark contrast to the car it replaces. Poke around and you can find a few places where MG’s saved money - there’s a sliding cover for one of the storage compartments that feels comically flimsy, and the top of the dash and the door cards are made of hard plastic - but the Clio and the Yaris have areas that feel equally cheap. The new MG3 is a transformation from the old model, and instantly becomes one of the best small cars you can buy Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer More importantly, MG’s given the 3 its best touchscreen infotainment system yet, and it’s loaded with equipment - climate control, a digital dashboard, sat-nav and a full suite of assisted driving features are standard on every model. The MG’s hybrid system is brand-new, and puts out an impressive 191hp - versus 140hp for the Clio and up to 130hp for the Yaris. That means it’s easily got any of them beat in a drag race, and makes mincemeat of overtakes or motorway sliproads. It’s not quite as efficient as the alternatives, but you might decide that the additional performance makes the small drop in mpg worthwhile. The real surprise is what happens when you reach a twisty road. The old MG3 was always shockingly good fun in the corners, but unexpectedly MG has managed to repeat the trick. The new MG3 handles brilliantly for a small car, and that makes it one of the most enjoyable small cars to drive. Sound interesting? Check here for our best MG3 deals, or look for a used MG3 on Carwow here. You could also check out other used MGs here, and remember that Carwow can even help you sell your car online too. WhatCar: What Car? says...At a time when many manufacturers are removing their small car offerings from the market, MG decided to give the MG3 a whole new lease of life.Now, that might seem a bit strange but there's actually good logic behind it. You see, with the Ford Fiesta going off sale, it’s the perfect time for a new version of the well-priced MG3 to swoop in and take a piece of the action.Better still, while the MG3 has always been one of the cheapest small cars you can buy and come with plenty of standard equipment, it's now available with hybrid technology to help improve performance and efficiency.MG3 video reviewIn theory, that should in turn help it compete against rivals, including the similarly affordable Dacia Sandero and Suzuki Swift, plus big names of the small-car market, such as the Renault Clio, Seat Ibiza, Skoda Fabia and VW Polo.So, is the MG3 now a worthy alternative to the best small cars?OverviewThe hybrid MG3's low pricing gives it a certain appeal, but a Suzuki Swift is cheaper on PCP finance and more efficient in the real world. Add in disappointing practicality, a poor driving position and the fact that most rivals are better to drive, and you've got a small car that's hard to recommend. We suspect the regular petrol car will make more sense, but we're yet to try this.Attractively pricedInterior looks fairly smartWell equippedDisappointing to driveNot very practical, even by small car standardsMG has a poor reliability recordNew car deals Best price from £13,860Estimated from £223pmAvailable nowFrom £13,860Leasing dealsFrom £223pm Our Pick Mg-motor-uk Mg3 1.5 Hybrid SE 5dr Auto review Read our version reviewRRP £16,995See the full rangePerformance & driveWhat it’s like to drive, and how quiet it isStrengths+Quick in a straight line+Refined when running on electric powerWeaknesses-Noisy at higher speeds-Rivals are more fun to drive-Not especially comfortableIn its cheapest form, the MG3 uses a conventional 1.5-litre petrol engine that produces 113bhp, but we've tested the Hybrid+ model, which combines that engine with an electric motor for a total of 191bhp.",

         "Is the MG S5 EV a good car? The MG S5 is the sequel to the MG ZS EV - it’s a compact, all-electric SUV, and like the rest of MG’s range majors on value-for-money - putting it right in the firing line of really excellent electric cars such as the Volvo EX30, Kia EV3 and Skoda Elroq. It’s also the first MG we’ve reviewed that doesn’t really have any caveats - no ‘it’s great for this, but…’ modifiers need to be added. While that does mean it’s not quite as standout as MG’s other cars, like the cheap-as-chips MG 4 or the BIK champion MG HS, it also means that it’s easier to recommend for more people. It’s like a chef who starts their career out with wild and divisive combinations like salmon teacakes with a candyfloss mousse, but matures into making a really solid sea bass with risotto. Like some of the most reliable dishes, the new S5 EV doesn’t exactly shout about its prowess. The styling is the first thing to get past - or the lack of styling, you could say. The S5 EV looks as though MG’s design team started with a normal SUV and then Photoshopped out any of its distinguishing features. While this definitely means it blends into the crowd, you’ll have to be a really magnolia kind of person to be excited by its featureless front end or lower grille ‘inspired’ by the Cyberster sports car. MG S5 EV: electric range, battery and charging data Range: 211 - 298 milesEfficiency: 4.3 - 4.7 mi/kWhBattery size: 49kWh/64kWhMax charge speed: 120kW/139kWCharge time AC: 7hrs / 9hrs 15m @ 7kWCharge time DC: 24min / 28min 10-80%Charge port location: Left rearPower outputs: 170hp / 228hp Things start to look up when you get inside, though. The S5 EV has MG’s best interior to date. Just about everything you touch is covered in soft-touch material, and you really have to look quite hard to find any cheap, nasty plastics - that’s not something you could say about the MG 4, which shares its underpinnings with the S5 EV. Better yet, MG’s listened to feedback from reviewers and journalists, and implemented a few features to make life just that little bit easier. There are physical climate controls underneath the screen so you don’t have to go rootling round in touchscreen menus just to change the temperature, and there’s an easy shortcut to switch off the more annoying driver assistance features too. The MG S5 EV isn't exactly eye-catching, but it offers a really impressive combination of space and equipment for the money Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The S5 EV is great for families as well, as it has bags of rear legroom and a 453-litre boot - nearly matching the roomy Kia EV3. There are two models available - a Standard Range car that can do up to 211 miles on a charge and a Long Range variant which claims up to 298 miles of range. It’s a shame MG has no plans to introduce an Extended Range model, as that could really take the fight to the Kia EV3 which has up to 375 miles of range. So behind the dull looks, the MG S5 EV is really quite a good electric car indeed. If you’re interested, you could check out our best MG S5 EV deals here, or find a great MG S5 leasing offer. You can browse used MGs for sale here, and remember that Carwow can even help you to sell your old car when the time comes. WhatCar: What Car? says...How do you make a popular car even more popular? Simple: you turn it into an SUV. And that's exactly what MG has done with its new MG S5 EV.The S5 EV is the direct replacement for the capable but not particularly inspiring MG ZS EV and it’s built using the same underpinnings as the impressive MG 4 electric hatchback. You know, the one that outsold almost everything else in the UK last year when it came to private electric car buyers.Those underpinnings are crucial. Because not only is the rear-wheel-drive MG 4 a decent handling car (unlike the front-wheel-drive ZS EV) but it also allows MG to use the batteries and motors from its dominant hatchback. And thanks to that you can expect a decent range, punchy performance and great value. MG S5 EV video reviewHowever, the S5 EV faces stronger competition than the model it replaces. At the affordable end, you’ve got fresh-faced small electric SUV rivals like the Jeep Avenger Electric, Kia EV3 and Smart #1. Go up in size (and price) and it’s rubbing shoulders with the Skoda Elroq and Renault Scenic – seriously polished family SUV contenders.",

         "Is the MG ZS a good car? The previous-generation MG ZS was a small SUV that you’d buy because it was cheap - and then spend the rest of your time apologising for it. It was unattractive, thirsty, poor to drive and had a really cheap-feeling interior. However, the second-generation model has had a true Cinderella-style glow-up, and should push the old car right to the back of everybody’s minds - it’s a huge improvement in every way. Based on the same mechanical underpinnings as the excellent MG3 hatchback, the new ZS gets an up-to-date hybrid engine, techy interior and a smart - if not stunning - new look. It’s like trading in your old Nokia for a new smartphone. Probably not the latest Apple iPhone, as MG is still firmly a budget brand - more like one of those off-brand Android phones that gives you lots and lots of bang for your buck. As a small hybrid SUV, there are alternatives to the MG ZS coming from every corner. Some of the best include the Renault Captur, the Hyundai Kona Hybrid, the Peugeot 2008 or the Carwow award-winning Toyota Yaris Cross. MG does things a bit differently to those cars, though. First of all, there’s the way the hybrid system works. It’s far more powerful than any of those alternatives - with 191hp beating out 140hp in the Captur or a measly 115hp in the Yaris Cross. MG’s done this by fitting a more powerful electric motor and a bigger battery, which means that most of the time it drives like an electric car with a petrol generator. However, if you put your foot down both power sources will give their all, making this quite a rapid little SUV. The ZS undercuts almost every alternative on price while offering loads of space and a powerful engine - but you may want to pay a little extra for a more polished ownership experience Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The comparison is also pretty favourable when it comes to interior space. The ZS has enough room for a six-foot adult to sit behind a driver of the same size in comfort, which means it’s also great for child seats or lanky teenagers. The 443-litre boot is also bigger than the hybrid Renault Captur or the Toyota Yaris Cross, and only marginally smaller than the Hyundai Kona hybrid. It’s in the cabin where you notice evidence of MG’s cost-cutting, though - there are plenty of low-rent material choices, and infotainment software that despite being a huge improvement on the old ZS isn’t as easy to use or as intuitive as the best systems out there. You do get loads of equipment, though. The top-spec Trophy model is still inexpensive but comes with climate control, sat-nav, smartphone connectivity, leather upholstery and a full suite of driver assistance tech including the semi-autonomous MG Pilot system. To drive, it’s another huge leap from the old car, which was pretty dire on the road. The ZS isn’t as satisfying to drive as a Renault Captur or Toyota Yaris Cross, despite its superior power output - but it has light controls and good visibility, making it great around town. Only poor refinement on the motorway and quite crashy suspension let the side down. If lots of power and equipment for a low price capture your imagination, check out our best MG ZS deals right here. You can find a used MG ZS for sale here, or search other used MGs for sale. And remember that Carwow can even help you sell your old car when the time comes. WhatCar: What Car? says...The trouble with SUVs is that they're more expensive than regular hatchback equivalents. At least most of them are, but the new MG ZS is actually cheaper than a Vauxhall Astra.And before you go thinking: \"Yes, but I bet it's a box on wheels with an engine from a lawnmower\", well the latest ZS is actually a fuel-sipping hybrid car and even the cheapest version comes loaded with creature comforts.The MG ZS is surprisingly big too. Even though it undercuts small SUVs like the Ford Puma and Peugeot 2008 on price, it's actually slightly longer than a Nissan Qashqai.

         "Is the MG ZS EV a good car? The MG ZS EV is an electric SUV that goes up against the likes of the Hyundai Kona Electric and Kia Niro EV – both of which are now well-established options at the affordable end of the electric car market. It’s a bit like going for a pair of cheap Bluetooth headphones. It might not be from the obvious choice of brands, but it promises to do a similar job at a lower cost. Since its revival as a mass-production manufacturer, MG’s models haven’t been the most exciting to look at. The new ZS EV is in a similar vein, but this updated version now comes with a blanked-out grille and LED headlights as part of a tweaked front end. There is also a new rear bumper with altered lights. MG has also improved the interior design, with the main addition being a new 10.1-inch infotainment touchscreen that has updated software to make it much smoother than before. A 7.0-inch driver display has also been added that offers efficiency and safety information. But where alternatives may offer slightly more comfort and refinement, you’ll find a lot of scratchy plastics alongside the new carbon fibre-effect upholstery finish on the dashboard and leather trim on the seats. In the back, you have decent legroom behind even the tallest of drivers. But as the batteries are mounted under the floor, your knees end up quite high. Headroom is also not the best, with the panoramic sunroof on Trophy models eating into the space even more. Taller passengers may struggle to get comfortable in the back. With an adjustable boot floor as standard, you get 470 litres. This is on par with the Kia Niro EV's 475 litres, but is 140 litres more than the Hyundai Kona Electric's offering. Folding the seats down creates a 1,100-litre space, but the seats don’t quite fold flat. Although refinement and overall quality aren’t the best, the ZS EV is more than capable of being a practical option Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The ZS EV comes with two battery options. The 51kWh Standard Range and 72kWh Long Range options offer up to 198 and 273 miles respectively. When driving in the real world across multiple conditions and in all three driving modes – Eco, Normal and Sport – you get closer to 240 miles. But leave it in Normal mode and you’ll get nearer to the claimed figure. Around town, the steering feels light and accurate. It also doesn’t allow many bumps into the cabin at slow speeds, with the suspension setup in normal mode helping it out. On the motorway, you’ll notice a lot of tyre noise and, if you go for the top-spec Trophy version, the roof rails do make a slight whistling noise. It feels comfortable on the whole, but the seats don’t have as much cushioning or support as you might like. When applying Sport mode and tackling a country road, the ZS feels pretty stable. It isn’t the most engaging car in the world and it can scrabble for grip in damper conditions – but for most that won’t be much of an issue. With its competitive pricing and practicality, the ZS EV is a model you should consider. It may not be as refined as alternatives, but it can certainly be a useful option if you’re in the market for an efficient SUV.

The Peugeot 2008 is a small SUV with a bold look, comprising strong colour schemes and a variety of slashes and creases that make alternatives such as the Volkswagen T-Cross look more than a little tedious. If small SUVs are more rugged versions of small cars, then the Peugeot 2008 is a 208 that’s kitted out for a paintballing trip. It has the same great tech you get in the hatchback, but is better prepared for some countryside pursuits thanks to its raised ride height. And the French flair loses no momentum when you get inside, helped by a 2023 update that saw a 10.0-inch infotainment display fitted as standard. The digital driver's display (standard on all but the base model) that sits above the teeny tiny steering wheel looks great, and has a cool 3D-effect on top-spec models that works with the fancy dashboard design to offer a neat appearance that's tough to match at this price point. Not many do better than the Peugeot for front-seat room, either. It will easily accommodate two tall adults and there’s plenty of scope to move the seat and steering wheel, though lumbar adjustment – which helps keep you comfy on long drives – is only optional on top-spec versions. Back seat space is less impressive, though. Tall passengers will have their knees brushing the front seats if they’re sitting behind someone else who’s tall. On the upside, there is plenty of head and foot room. We think the best version of the Peugeot 2008 is the 130hp 1.2-litre petrol in GT trim, as it's stylish and the engine is well-suited to the family SUV Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer In the boot, the 2008 has 434 litres to work with, which is better than the Skoda Kamiq and Seat Arona, but falls short of the Volkswagen T-Cross and Ford Puma. Hit the road and you’ll find the 2008 is a great all-rounder. Its steering is light in town, but weights up to give you more confidence at faster speeds. The slick six-speed manual gearbox (top-spec models get an eight-speed automatic) is the perfect match for the Peugeot’s sporty small steering wheel, though that's where the sportiness ends. It's relatively fun on a winding road, but it's happier taking things easy. The most powerful engine helps make it a bit more enjoyable, though. It has 130hp and is both sprightly and cheap to run. The manual Allure version is a bit more economical than the automatic GT, but official figures make the entry level 100hp engine the cheapest to run. But what makes the 2008 stand out from alternatives is its eye-catching styling that proves cheap-to-run and practical family cars can still be desirable. For that reason alone, it’s worth shortlisting against cars like the Seat Arona and VW T-Cross. And, of course, the 2008 is available in fully electric E-2008 form.

WhatCar: What Car? says...Fortune favours the brave, and setting your sights high is never a bad thing – just imagine if NASA had decided that going to the Moon was too much of a lofty goal. That’s why we like that the Peugeot 2008 has high ambitions.How so? Well, for decades Peugeot has been duking it out with the so-called mainstream brands (and is still doing so today), but the upper end of the 2008's engine and trim range gives this small SUV a price tag that strays into the territory of the more premium Audi Q2 and Lexus LBX.Peugeot 2008 video reviewDoes it justify setting its sights on those types of rivals? That's a question we'll be answering in this review. We'll also tell you how we rate the 2008 against rivals from fellow Stellantis brands, as well as models such as the Ford Puma, Renault Captur, Skoda Kamiq and VW T-Roc.So, read on to find out everything you need to know about the petrol-powered Peugeot 2008.

         "Is the Peugeot 208 a good car? The latest Peugeot 208 is an extensive facelift of the second-generation car, first launched in 2019. The newest model brings the car’s styling right up to date and adds an in-vogue hybrid engine as a sort of halfway house between a pure petrol model and the all-electric E-208. What it doesn’t change is what’s great about the 208 - its sense of style, lovely interior and chuckable chassis which make it a pleasure to drive. In many ways the 208 is like the designer handbag of the small hatchback world - it’s not as practical as some of the alternatives, but it’s handsome, glamorous and feels good to own. There are some really strong options available as alternatives, though. The Renault Clio is just as good-looking and offers a huge boot, nice interior and super-efficient engines. The Toyota Yaris offers a ten-year-warranty and proven hybrid engine, and the Volkswagen Polo is solid, posh and with an unmatched image. The 208’s style stands out from the crowd. It’s small, with a squat stance and intricate detailing that makes it look really glitzy even as a low-spec model. The front is dominated by Peugeot’s distinctive ‘three-claw’ LED daytime running lights, the line of which continues up into the headlights - you get a similar effect at the rear. The new Peugeot badge sits on a grille with body-coloured flashes, and round the side you even get a shortened rear window line which is a call back to the iconic 205. Inside, the 208 is the equal of any premium car in terms of its quality and design. There’s a new 10.0-inch touchscreen sat high up, with a clear display, responsive interface and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto included as standard. Material quality is high throughout, and you can feel that on the soft-touch dashboard with a woven finish or the row of piano key-style switches above the gear lever. The Peugeot 208 is the first small car to offer petrol, diesel and electric options. If you have access to charging at home or work, the EV is a superb choice Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer It’s not particularly roomy, though. A Renault Clio has a much bigger boot than the 208’s 311 litres, and a Skoda Fabia is far better for accommodating rear passengers. Even the 208’s front seats aren’t the best for very tall drivers, which is a shame. You also get Peugeot’s unique i-Cockpit layout, which means the shrunken steering wheel sits low and you view the dials over the top of it, rather than through the rim. Though this is divisive, it can be very comfortable - and the tiny wheel makes the 208 feel darty and responsive to drive. There are three engine options available for the 208. The entry-level car comes with a 1.2-litre petrol engine with a six-speed manual gearbox, or you can have a 1.2-litre hybrid automatic in two power outputs. Whichever you choose, you can expect good efficiency and a really nice refined drive. The 208 is comfortable on the motorway, feels darty and nimble around town and can even be quite fun on a twisting back road. The challenge is that a Renault Clio is arguably the more fun car and has a wider breadth of talents, while a Toyota Yaris will be even cheaper to run. But the 208 doesn’t remotely embarrass itself out on the road. If the 208 catches your eye, then you can nab yourself one for a great price by looking at our best Peugeot 208 deals. You can also browse deals on other Peugeot models here, or click here to find a used Peugeot for sale. And remember, Carwow’s the place to be if you need to sell your car. WhatCar: What Car? says...You can always rely on a French car maker to build a stylish small car. Whether it’s any good or not is another question entirely, but the current Peugeot 208 is one of the good ones.Let's be clear: this is a completely different model to the first-generation 208. That's marvellous news, because the original wasn't very good, and struggled to compete with rivals such as the Seat Ibiza and VW Polo. This second-generation car presents much more of a challenge to them.Better still, the current 208 doesn’t just stack up well against those mainstream rivals. The more expensive versions in the range are genuine alternatives to the premium badge-wearing Audi A1 with its impressive interior and comfortable ride.It all sounds pretty good so far, but how do we rate the Peugeot 208 against the best small cars and, more importantly, should you buy one?

         "Is the Peugeot 3008 a good car? Peugeot’s 3008 has shot up the ranks since the first one was launched more than a decade ago. It may have started as a tall (and somewhat ugly) crossover, but now it’s a fully-fledged SUV-coupe, with really stylish looks and much more high-tech kit. It’s like someone who used to be a bit podgy, but has hit the gym and overhauled their wardrobe. While the all-electric version, the E-3008, might get all the headlines, a big chunk of the 3008’s sales in the UK will be taken by this, the hybrid model — not least because, in spite of all the new on-board technology, it’s a fairly handy £10,000 less expensive than the E-3008… That being said, there are plenty of compelling alternatives to the Peugeot 3008, many of which are a bit more affordable. Some of the best all-rounders include the Nissan Qashqai, Kia Sportage and Hyundai Tucson. Then there's the practical, great value Citroen C5 Aircross and stylish but impractical Toyota C-HR to consider, too. Power for the 3008 Hybrid comes from a 134bhp 1.2-litre three-cylinder petrol engine — that’s the same one that Peugeot has been making for donkey’s years, but it’s been upgraded for life as a hybrid. The system sort of sits between a ‘traditional’ Toyota-style full hybrid and a mild-hybrid. So, the 3008 Hybrid can drive itself on electric power alone, but only for very short bursts at very low speeds. It’s good for around town, but less useful on long motorway hauls. Peugeot reckons you’ll get 51mpg out of it, and CO2 emissions are kept to a trim 124g/km. Inside, there’s a huge, sweeping all-digital 21.0-inch screen that dominates the cabin. It sits up and away from the driver, almost resting against the windscreen. As is Peugeot’s recent tradition, the steering wheel is small, hexagonal, and sits more or less in your lap. We've tried it in the E-3008 and it's much easier to find a comfortable driving position where the wheel doesn't block the instrument display than ever before, but it's probably still worth trying before you buy. The 3008 is now a fully-fledged SUV-coupe, with really stylish looks and much more high-tech kit Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer To the right of the steering wheel is a slim touchpad which has configurable shortcut buttons for the big screen so that you can access the menus you need more easily, but sadly Peugeot insists on putting all of the climate control functions on the screen, which makes it more fiddly than it needs to be. The gear lever is now a chunky toggle switch behind the steering wheel, so that leaves the centre console free for cupholders and storage spaces, of which there are loads, and the 3008’s mixture of back-lighting and soft fabric surfaces on the dashboard make for a cabin that’s almost good enough to challenge the mighty Germans on quality, and surpass them on design. In spite of that rakish roof, there’s good space in the back seats, even for grown-ups, although those with longer legs will find that their feet and knees sit up a bit too high, as the floor has been raised up to make space for the electric version’s battery pack. The boot is a useful 520 litres, but that sloping roofline makes loading in really bulky items a bit of a challenge, and alternatives such as the Hyundai Tucson have a larger capacity. Speaking of that roofline, the Peugeot 3008 is a really good-looking thing. It manages to be imposingly chunky while also sporting sleek lines and cool details such as Peugeot's signature three-claw light designs. Stick with Carwow if you want the best Peugeot 3008 deals. You can also get a great price on a used 3008, or browse the latest used Peugeot deals from our network of trusted dealers. When it's time to sell your car, Carwow can help with that, too. WhatCar: What Car? says...The mimic octopus is one of few animals known to morph into different shapes, either to survive or make itself more attractive. And the Peugeot 3008 we're reviewing here has done the same – by shapeshifting to become more desirable.When the 3008 made its debut nearly two decades ago it looked like a swollen hatchback or mini MPV, then for the second generation it morphed into a more familiar SUV shape. Now this third-generation 3008 combines elements of a family SUV with a sleeker coupé SUV roofline for a more eye-catching \"fastback\" look.Initially, the new 3008 is available with a hybrid petrol engine and a choice of two well-equipped trim levels. There’s also an all-electric version for the first time (to read about that see our Peugeot e-3008 review).Of course, the 3008 isn't the only fastback-style SUV on sale so this all-new model will face competition from quite a few well-established rivals. They range from the Audi Q3 Sportback and BMW X2 to the Renault Arkana and Renault Rafale. There’s also the Cupra Formentor and Peugeot 408 to consider.",

       "[\"bmw, 1-series, Is the BMW 1 Series a good car? The BMW 1 Series is a posh family hatchback with a high-quality cabin and loads of cutting-edge tech. You may also be considering the Audi A3 or Mercedes A-Class if you’re shopping for a premium hatchback, and the 1 Series was updated in 2024 with a new look and an updated cabin. The 1 Series has always been the go-to if you want a premium hatchback with a sporty edge. It’s a bit like choosing a pair of Yeezys over some Dr. Marten loafers. There are very few small cars which feel as posh inside as the BMW 1 Series, and this was only improved during the 2024 update. All the materials feel soft and yielding and everything is really solid. Quality in here is much better than it is in a Mercedes A-Class. The tech you get inside is also really impressive. All cars get a huge curved display atop the dashboard comprising a 10.7-inch touchscreen and a 10.3-inch digital driver’s display, and it’s all very responsive and easy to use. Watch: BMW M135 review As is the case in most BMWs the driving position is spot on. There’s loads of adjustment in the seats and steering wheel for all drivers big and small to get comfortable. Once you’re ready to go, there are also plenty of cubby holes for you to empty your pockets into. Moving to the rear seats, the space on offer is best described as adequate. If you’re only carrying two people back there then they’ll have enough legroom, however headroom could be a struggle for taller adults. Getting three people back there is also a tight squeeze, and a Volkswagen Golf is more adept at carrying rear passengers. Boot space is also down on some of this car's key competitors. In the basic petrol model you get significantly less space than an Audi A3 or Honda Civic have to offer, however the BMW’s load area is a nice square shape and there isn’t much of a lip to haul items over. As for engines, there are just three on offer and they’re all petrol-powered. Entry-level models get a 1.5-litre three-cylinder with 170hp, then there’s a 2.0-litre with 218hp or the range-topping M135 hot hatchback with 300hp and all-wheel drive. The 1 Series really is a good, premium-feeling small car, it’s just a little bit expensive Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Once you’ve loaded the car up and hit the road, the first thing you’ll notice is that even the entry-level petrol model has a hot hatch feel to it. The steering is responsive and it’s great fun to thread down a country road, though the performance-focused M135 isn't as exciting as the Volkswagen Golf R, even if there's no denying it's fast in a straight line. The sportiness does come at the expense of comfort though, because even the normal 1 Series is a bit firmer than an Audi A3. This is especially apparent around town, where the car jitters around over potholes and broken surfaces. Still, at least the steering is nice and light and you get decent all-round visibility. Things settle down on the motorway, where the cabin feels nice and hushed. There’s just a hint of tyre roar disturbing the peace, but the 1 Series is a relaxing car for covering long distances. So the BMW 1 Series is great to drive, packed with tech and really well-made. Some alternatives are more comfortable though, and quite a lot of features are pricey options. Check out the latest BMW 1 Series deals if you fancy this as your next car and want to save some cash, or browse offers on other BMW models. You can also take a look at used 1 Series’ available now, and don’t forget that you can also sell your current car through Carwow for a great price. WhatCar: What Car? says...The design team behind the latest BMW 1 Series seem to have adopted a Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS) philosophy – and with good reason.When the first-generation 1 Series debuted, it was a proudly unconventional family car with a sporty rear-wheel-drive lay-out, bold styling and a wide range of engines, including a punchy six-cylinder petrol.While those features thrilled driving enthusiasts, they didn’t always appeal to the car’s primary target: families. So with the third-generation 1 Series BMW shifted to a more practical front-wheel-drive layout (with the option of four-wheel drive for certain variants).BMW 1 Series video reviewNow, as part of the 1 Series' latest facelift, BMW decided to simplify the 1 Series package further. In the UK you can get two versions – the BMW 120 and 123. They run on petrol and have mild-hybrid tech.The front end was given a sharper look, while the interior received a fairly thorough makeover – pretty much the whole dashboard has changed. So is the latest BMW 1 Series still competitive against its key rivals, the Audi A3, Mercedes A-Class and Volkswagen Golf? Let's find out…, Carwow \\\\\\\\ Whatcar\",\n",
       " 'bmw, 2-series-active-tourer, Is the BMW 2 Series Active Tourer a good car? Crossovers and SUVs dominate the family car market these days, however BMW is keen to prove that the humble MPV is still deserving of a place on the driveway with the 2 Series Active Tourer. You can think of the 2 Series Active Tourer as a more sensible alternative to cars like the Audi Q2 and Mercedes GLA, and BMW’s own X1. If those cars were a pair of trendy Nike Air Max trainers, the 2 Series Active Tourer is a sensible pair of Hush Puppies. In terms of premium people carriers, only Mercedes offers something similar, with the B-Class very much in the same mould as the Active Tourer - practical rather than fashionable for the size. It may not be as stylish as a modern SUV, but you can lift the 2 Series Active Tourer by going for the M Sport pack. This gives the car some sporty-looking bumpers, as well as 18-inch alloy wheels, making it look a bit less dowdy and a bit more aggressive. This may not hide the car’s boxy shape, but the plus side is a practical cabin. Up-front there’s plenty of headroom, as well as loads of adjustment in the seats to find your ideal driving position. You get plenty of storage, with a small cubby under the armrest as well as a big space under the centre console where you could keep a bag. The glovebox is an average size, as are the door bins. You can get a wireless charging pad in front of the cupholders, which has a helpful clip to keep your phone in place. The spacious theme continues in the rear. Headroom is still generous, and there’s plenty of knee room as well. There’s also a handy armrest with cupholders in the rear, and fitting a child seat is easy thanks to the exposed ISOFIX anchor points. As for the boot, you get 470 litres of space in the 218d models, or 415 litres in the 220i and 223i versions. Plug-in hybrid versions drop to 406 litres of cargo room thanks to a battery pack under the floor, although that’s still around the same as the 405 litres offered by the Audi Q2. The 2 Series Active Tourer may not be as stylish as an SUV, but it offers plenty of practicality and a really nice interior Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The Mercedes B-Class gets 420 litres of boot space, so slightly more than the petrol and plug-in hybrid Active Tourer, but less than you get in the 218d version. It’s worth bearing in mind however that the diesel’s additional storage space is situated under the boot floor., rather than within the main luggage area The exterior design may not be as exciting as an SUV, however the interior can easily match something like a Mercedes GLA. Everything feels really well screwed together, and the materials used are all high-quality. The overall cabin layout is very similar to the BMW X1 SUV, meaning you get the same floating armrest and wide central air vent, as well as the same 10.25-inch digital driver’s display and 10.7-inch infotainment system. Engine-wise, there are plenty to choose from. Only one of them is diesel though, the 218d with 150hp. Then there’s a couple of petrol models, the 220i and the 223i with 170hp and 218hp respectively. If you’re a company car driver, you’ll probably be looking at the tax-efficient 225e plug-in hybrid. This gets a 1.5-litre petrol engine paired with an electric motor, producing 245hp and capable of an official 56 miles on electric power alone. The plug-in hybrid makes the most sense around town, where the instant acceleration of the electric motor makes pulling out at busy junctions easy. Whichever engine you go for though, the 2 Series Active Tourer is easy to drive in the urban jungle. The BMW 2 Series Active Tourer may not be the most exciting offering in the family car segment, however if you’re looking for a well-made, premium-feeling car to haul the family around, and you’re not too bothered about looking flash while doing it, this car is certainly worth a look-in. If you’re looking to make the BMW 2 Series Active Tourer your next car, check out the latest offers available on carwow. Alternatively, you can browse used BMW models, and you can sell your car for what it’s really worth. WhatCar: What Car? says...The BMW 2 Series Active Tourer and other MPVs have been suffering at the hands of SUVs in recent years. In fact, while people carriers used to be the high-rise wagon of choice for families, most now go for something that looks a bit more like an off-roader. To that end, car manufacturers have been focusing on creating SUVs that fit all niches and have taken their eyes off the MPV ball. BMW hasn’t. Instead, it’s looking to tempt families out of small SUVs with its own sporty-looking MPV, the 2 Series Active Tourer. That won’t be easy though, and it’ll take more than just good aesthetics and a premium badge on the nose. So what’s on offer? Well, BMW has equipped it with a class-leading interior and loads of standard equipment.The 2 Series Active Tourer also comes with the choice of a petrol engine with two different power outputs and mild-hybrid assistance or a diesel option. There are also two plug-in hybrid (PHEV) variants – perfect for company car drivers and those wanting to keep running costs low., Carwow \\\\\\\\ Whatcar',\n",
       " \"bmw, 3-series, Is the BMW 3 Series a good car? The BMW 3 Series is like Alan Shearer. No, it’s not from Newcastle, but like Shearer it has for generations been a reliable and impressive performer, able to out-shine European and world opposition at the highest level, and is still going strong even in its advancing years. While Audi might be re-inventing the A4 as the new A5 (rather confusingly) and Mercedes has brought out a new C-Class while BMW was just updating the 3 Series, this is still a car that looks and feels totally cutting edge, especially in how it drives. Though if you would also consider an electric car, the Tesla Model 3 feels more futuristic still. In terms of styling, the most recent round of updates for the 3 Series haven’t changed that much. There’s been some small nipping and tucking around the lights and grille, some new wheels and paint options, but the overall shape and style remains the same. That’s both good and bad — good in that, overall, the 3 Series is still a handsome thing. Bad in that it hasn’t addressed some design mis-steps, such as the way the 3 looks overly bulky around the rear wheelarches. Basic Sport models get chrome trim around the radiator grille, while M-Sport models look a little more glowering with blacked-out trim. Watch: Audi A4 v BMW 3 Series v Genesis G70 v Mercedes C-Class It’s in the cabin that you’ll find the bigger changes. BMW has binned the (rather attractive) separate digital instruments and infotainment screen in favour of the big, curved, combined screen setup taken from other models such as the 4 Series and 5 Series. This means that the 3 Series now has the latest and most up to date infotainment software — which can update itself via over-the-air links — but even though the old iDrive click-wheel has been retained, there are some fiddly bits to find your way around on the screens, and the graphics don’t look quite as nice as they used to. Space in the cabin remains unchanged, which means you get just enough for four adults to sit in reasonable comfort, but there’s not the stretch-out space you’d find elsewhere. The boot is practical, especially in the Touring estate, but remember that the plug-in hybrid 330e — a hugely popular model with business user-choosers — loses quite a lot of that space to the battery, to the point where a basic VW Golf hatchback has a bigger boot. Not that you’ll care about boot space much when you’re sitting up in the driver’s seat. The BMW 3 Series has long been considered the best of its breed to drive, and that hasn’t changed, despite the fact it’s bigger and heavier now than it has ever been. While we have to wait to see what Audi has cooked up with the new A5 saloon, the 3 Series most definitely has the beating of the otherwise-impressive Mercedes C-Class when it comes to the driving experience. This is still a car that looks and feels totally cutting edge, especially in the way it drives Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The engine range has shrunk somewhat in the past few years — your choice at the base of the BMW 3 Series lineup is now restricted to the petrol 320i or the plug-in hybrid 330e. Bye-bye diesel 320d — we shall miss your combo of easy-going performance and exceptional economy, though there are plenty of excellent used examples to be found. In fact, there are now no diesel 3 Series models at all, something of a shock when you remember how wildly successful they have been over the years. Mind you, the 330e looks like it might be settling into the 320d’s economy shoes, not least because a big battery upgrade now means that it can do as much as 62 miles on electric power alone, if you remember to charge up the battery (which can’t, alas, be fast-charged from public DC chargers). Of course, if it’s serious performance you want — but you don’t fancy the expense and insurance cost of stepping up to a full-on M3 — there’s the brilliant M340i with its 374hp, straight-six, 3.0-litre turbo engine. Whisper it, but that’s actually a more enjoyable car to drive even than the mighty M3 itself. If you want to bag yourself a great deal, check out Carwow’s BMW 3 Series deals. You can also get a great price on a used 3 Series as well as other used BMWs from our network of trusted dealers. Carwow’s Sell My Car service takes the pain out of moving your old motor on, too. WhatCar: What Car? says...The BMW 3 Series has always done the business for business people – and this latest version is no exception. It's a sporty rear-wheel-drive executive car that's available as a tax-efficient plug-in hybrid and comes with all the latest tech.The 3 Series has moved with the times in other ways too. As part of its recent mid-life facelift, the seventh-generation model we're reviewing here has gained some subtle styling updates – but lost its diesel engines. You can still choose from a range of strong petrol engines to suit most tastes, one with four-wheel drive (BMW calls it xDrive).Once you've factored in all the infotainment goodies and safety equipment you get as standard, the 3 Series looks like it's in with a shot at topping our best executive cars list.BMW 3 Series video reviewLet's not be too hasty though – there are a few other models that give it a run for its money, starting with the 3 Series' long-standing rival, the Mercedes C-Class.

       " \"bmw, 4-series, Is the BMW 4 Series a good car? The BMW 4 Series is an upmarket coupe that seats four and is designed to be more stylish and fun to drive than the BMW 3 Series saloon on which it’s based. It’s also more fun than its main alternatives, the Audi A5 and Mercedes C-Class Coupe. The two-door 4 Series Coupe sits in a family of 4 Series models, along with the convertible and five-door Gran Coupe models, while the BMW i4 is the electric version of the regular 4 Series Coupe, with the coupe and convertible getting updates in 2024. But in terms of styling, if the German coupes were in an orchestra, the Audi and Mercedes would be tickling the triangle while the BMW tries its best on the tuba – that grille makes the most noise. Some will like it and some really won’t. Still, beyond that, the 4 Series is a good looking car. Its aggressive creases, sporty body kit and sloping roofline make it a sort of half-price BMW 8 Series. Inside, it’s not as in-your-face as a C-Class in terms of design, but it’s classier and the levels of quality are better than in both Mercedes and Audi. In Mercedes’ larger cars its infotainment system narrowly beats BMW’s for visual drama and the way it works, but in the 4 Series and C-Class (where Mercedes fits its older systems), it’s the BMW that takes the win. The BMW’s looks better, works better and comes with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Praise be. Audi’s system comes a close third on all fronts. The range-topping M440i is brilliant, but most people will love the 420i M Sport. Head to our deals page for the very best prices! Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The 4 Series has seating for four people and those in the front seats will have all the space they need. The driver gets a good amount of adjustment, but it’s disappointing that lumbar adjustment – good for staying comfortable on long drives – isn’t standard and only comes as part of a very expensive pack. Grrr. The rear seats are fine for legroom, even for adults, but they’ll struggle with head room if they are anywhere close to six foot. Getting in and out of the back is a struggle too, because there are no rear doors – but hey, it’s a coupe. Still, the 4 Series’ boot is a generous 440 litres, which is only slightly smaller than an A5’s and some way bigger than the C-Class Coupe’s. There’s lots of engine choice, and there isn’t a bad one. There are 2.0-litre and 3.0-litre petrol and diesels, ranging from 184hp to 374hp, but the majority of people will find the 184hp 420i 2.0-litre petrol a great choice. Do more motorway miles? The 190hp 420d 2.0-litre diesel will cruise more efficiently. If you want maximum punch, the M440d diesel and M440i petrol both have powerful six-cylinder engines with startling performance. Then there’s the high-performance BMW M4, which we have reviewed separately. Handily, all 4 Series models are huge fun to drive. They’re lower and stiffer than a BMW 3 Series, and turn into corners with more agility than an A5 or C-Class Coupe. The xDrive all-wheel drive system is available with the 420d and standard on the M440 models for added security in slippery conditions, plus BMW offers things like upgraded brakes, a sports differential and adaptive suspension to really spice things up. The M models get this as standard. That agility does mean the 4 Series feels harder over bumps in town, even in its most comfortable driving mode, but otherwise, its standard parking sensors and rear camera make light work of parking. On the motorway, the suspension feels less abrupt and the 4 Series cruises quietly, but like the lumbar support, BMW’s clever adaptive cruise control with lane-keep steering assist costs a fortune to add as part of a pack. More grrr. Despite these minor setbacks, we think the 4 Series is the best of its breed. See how much you could save on a new BMW 4 Series with carwow, or check out our latest used BMWs. And if you need to sell your car, we can help with that too! WhatCar: What Car? says...Historically, BMW coupés have simply been swoopier, less practical versions of their saloon car counterparts. Not any more – the BMW 4 Series is a rakish model in its own right.Sure, the 4 Series is based on the same underpinnings as the more sensibly shaped BMW 3 Series but the differences go well beyond losing the back doors. BMW has widened the car's rear, lowered the centre of gravity, retuned the suspension and stiffened the chassis.All that should help make the 4 Series even more agile and capable than its saloon equivalent through corners. In other words, BMW has worked hard to make sure this is a car with the performance to match its sleek looks.Coupés like the 4 Series are quite niche these days, but has BMW done enough to keep you away from its main rival, the Mercedes CLE? Read on to find...OverviewThe BMW 4 Series is great to drive, smart inside and roomier than you might imagine.

       " \"bmw, 5-series, Is the BMW 5 Series a good car? Think of an all-rounder, and two things are likely to spring to mind. First will be a Swiss army knife – the global icon for ‘a thing that does everything’ – and the next could well be the BMW 5 Series. Since debuting five decades ago, this posh German saloon has proven time and again that it can offer comfort, bags of practicality, the latest technology and serious performance. It’s a similar story with its two key alternatives – if you’re considering a 5 Series you should also take a look at the Mercedes E-Class and Audi A6. Or perhaps the Lexus ES if you want a left-field option. The latest 5 Series clearly takes hints from BMW’s recent bold design direction as seen on the likes of the 2 Series Coupe and XM, albeit a little more subdued. That said, its styling is rather challenging, lacking the elegance of its predecessors. There are odd, incohesive lines around the headlights and front bumper, a front grille that seemingly mimics beaver teeth and the rear end looks like the designers couldn’t agree on what to do so gave up halfway through the process. Watch: All-electric BMW i5 review It’s a different story inside, with BMW’s latest infotainment system present and correct, combining a 12.3-inch digital drivers’ display with a 14.9-inch central screen. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are included as standard, and operate wirelessly. The overall design is pretty good and although some of the physical buttons have disappeared, forcing you to use the touchscreen more, there are high quality materials and solid build quality to make up for it. Artificial leather upholstery comes as standard, though you can opt for the real stuff, as well as a part-Alcantara choice if you’d prefer. So you get all the good tech, but if practicality is key, you might be a touch disappointed. Petrol-powered versions of the new 5 Series promise 520 litres of boot capacity, which is less than the Mercedes E-Class and Audi A6, though not by much. On the plus side, unlike those two cars the BMW’s boot doesn’t lose capacity in the plug-in hybrid version. A Touring estate version will arrive later if you need the extra room. The BMW 5 Series is available with one petrol engine, offering 208hp, and a pair of plug-in hybrid versions with up to 489hp. Notably, there’s no diesel version, which is a sign of the times given that this model is typically popular with those who rack up serious motorway mileage. The BMW 5 Series is comfortable to drive and has a lovely interior – shame the outside just looks so… bleugh Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer It’s goodbye to diesel, but hello to electric for the first time in a 5 Series. The i5 – reviewed separately here – will do up to 361 miles on a charge, but is quite a bit more expensive than the petrol-powered model. As you might expect, the BMW 5 Series is a comfortable and refined motorway cruiser. There’s a little bit of wind and road noise but overall it’s a relaxing way to rack up miles. However, BMWs usually excel at also being great fun on a twisty road, but the latest 5 Series is a bit disappointing in this regard. The steering is numb and doesn’t give much feedback about how much grip the tyres have, while the car just generally lacks the eagerness to turn into a corner that made old versions so much fun to drive. An Audi A6 is, surprisingly, more fun here… Regardless, this is a great all-rounder and just a fraction better overall than the Mercedes E-Class and Audi A6. Want one?

WhatCar: What Car? says...Lionel Messi has won football’s Ballon d'Or a record eight times, but he’s still got nothing on the BMW 5 Series, which has won 27 What Car? Awards over the years – more than any other model.Part of the reason for the 5 Series' sustained success is that BMW has done a great job of keeping it up to date. The latest version is even available as an electric car – the BMW i5 – which you can read about in our separate review. However, here we’re focusing on the other variants.The cheapest option is the 520i, which uses a 205bhp 2.0-litre mild-hybrid petrol engine, and there are also two plug-in hybrids: the 530e, which produces 295bhp, and the 550e, with a whopping 482bhp.

      "[Ollama] Processing textbmw, 1-series, Is the BMW 1 Series a good car? The BMW 1 Series is a posh family hatchback with a high-quality cabin and loads of cutting-edge tech. You may also be considering the Audi A3 or Mercedes A-Class if you’re shopping for a premium hatchback, and the 1 Series was updated in 2024 with a new look and an updated cabin. The 1 Series has always been the go-to if you want a premium hatchback with a sporty edge. It’s a bit like choosing a pair of Yeezys over some Dr. Marten loafers. There are very few small cars which feel as posh inside as the BMW 1 Series, and this was only improved during the 2024 update. All the materials feel soft and yielding and everything is really solid. Quality in here is much better than it is in a Mercedes A-Class. The tech you get inside is also really impressive. All cars get a huge curved display atop the dashboard comprising a 10.7-inch touchscreen and a 10.3-inch digital driver’s display, and it’s all very responsive and easy to use. Watch: BMW M135 review As is the case in most BMWs the driving position is spot on. There’s loads of adjustment in the seats and steering wheel for all drivers big and small to get comfortable. Once you’re ready to go, there are also plenty of cubby holes for you to empty your pockets into. Moving to the rear seats, the space on offer is best described as adequate. If you’re only carrying two people back there then they’ll have enough legroom, however headroom could be a struggle for taller adults. Getting three people back there is also a tight squeeze, and a Volkswagen Golf is more adept at carrying rear passengers. Boot space is also down on some of this car's key competitors. In the basic petrol model you get significantly less space than an Audi A3 or Honda Civic have to offer, however the BMW’s load area is a nice square shape and there isn’t much of a lip to haul items over. As for engines, there are just three on offer and they’re all petrol-powered. Entry-level models get a 1.5-litre three-cylinder with 170hp, then there’s a 2.0-litre with 218hp or the range-topping M135 hot hatchback with 300hp and all-wheel drive. The 1 Series really is a good, premium-feeling small car, it’s just a little bit expensive Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Once you’ve loaded the car up and hit the road, the first thing you’ll notice is that even the entry-level petrol model has a hot hatch feel to it. The steering is responsive and it’s great fun to thread down a country road, though the performance-focused M135 isn't as exciting as the Volkswagen Golf R, even if there's no denying it's fast in a straight line. The sportiness does come at the expense of comfort though, because even the normal 1 Series is a bit firmer than an Audi A3. This is especially apparent around town, where the car jitters around over potholes and broken surfaces. Still, at least the steering is nice and light and you get decent all-round visibility. Things settle down on the motorway, where the cabin feels nice and hushed. There’s just a hint of tyre roar disturbing the peace, but the 1 Series is a relaxing car for covering long distances. So the BMW 1 Series is great to drive, packed with tech and really well-made. Some alternatives are more comfortable though, and quite a lot of features are pricey options. Check out the latest BMW 1 Series deals if you fancy this as your next car and want to save some cash, or browse offers on other BMW models. You can also take a look at used 1 Series’ available now, and don’t forget that you can also sell your current car through Carwow for a great price.

So with the third-generation 1 Series BMW shifted to a more practical front-wheel-drive layout (with the option of four-wheel drive for certain variants).BMW 1 Series video reviewNow, as part of the 1 Series' latest facelift, BMW decided to simplify the 1 Series package further.

      "[Ollama] Processing textbmw, 2-series-active-tourer, Is the BMW 2 Series Active Tourer a good car? Crossovers and SUVs dominate the family car market these days, however BMW is keen to prove that the humble MPV is still deserving of a place on the driveway with the 2 Series Active Tourer. You can think of the 2 Series Active Tourer as a more sensible alternative to cars like the Audi Q2 and Mercedes GLA, and BMW’s own X1. If those cars were a pair of trendy Nike Air Max trainers, the 2 Series Active Tourer is a sensible pair of Hush Puppies. In terms of premium people carriers, only Mercedes offers something similar, with the B-Class very much in the same mould as the Active Tourer - practical rather than fashionable for the size. It may not be as stylish as a modern SUV, but you can lift the 2 Series Active Tourer by going for the M Sport pack. This gives the car some sporty-looking bumpers, as well as 18-inch alloy wheels, making it look a bit less dowdy and a bit more aggressive. This may not hide the car’s boxy shape, but the plus side is a practical cabin. Up-front there’s plenty of headroom, as well as loads of adjustment in the seats to find your ideal driving position. You get plenty of storage, with a small cubby under the armrest as well as a big space under the centre console where you could keep a bag. The glovebox is an average size, as are the door bins. You can get a wireless charging pad in front of the cupholders, which has a helpful clip to keep your phone in place. The spacious theme continues in the rear. Headroom is still generous, and there’s plenty of knee room as well. There’s also a handy armrest with cupholders in the rear, and fitting a child seat is easy thanks to the exposed ISOFIX anchor points. As for the boot, you get 470 litres of space in the 218d models, or 415 litres in the 220i and 223i versions. Plug-in hybrid versions drop to 406 litres of cargo room thanks to a battery pack under the floor, although that’s still around the same as the 405 litres offered by the Audi Q2. The 2 Series Active Tourer may not be as stylish as an SUV, but it offers plenty of practicality and a really nice interior Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The Mercedes B-Class gets 420 litres of boot space, so slightly more than the petrol and plug-in hybrid Active Tourer, but less than you get in the 218d version. It’s worth bearing in mind however that the diesel’s additional storage space is situated under the boot floor., rather than within the main luggage area The exterior design may not be as exciting as an SUV, however the interior can easily match something like a Mercedes GLA. Everything feels really well screwed together, and the materials used are all high-quality. The overall cabin layout is very similar to the BMW X1 SUV, meaning you get the same floating armrest and wide central air vent, as well as the same 10.25-inch digital driver’s display and 10.7-inch infotainment system. Engine-wise, there are plenty to choose from. Only one of them is diesel though, the 218d with 150hp. Then there’s a couple of petrol models, the 220i and the 223i with 170hp and 218hp respectively. If you’re a company car driver, you’ll probably be looking at the tax-efficient 225e plug-in hybrid. This gets a 1.5-litre petrol engine paired with an electric motor, producing 245hp and capable of an official 56 miles on electric power alone. The plug-in hybrid makes the most sense around town, where the instant acceleration of the electric motor makes pulling out at busy junctions easy. Whichever engine you go for though, the 2 Series Active Tourer is easy to drive in the urban jungle. The BMW 2 Series Active Tourer may not be the most exciting offering in the family car segment, however if you’re looking for a well-made, premium-feeling car to haul the family around, and you’re not too bothered about looking flash while doing it, this car is certainly worth a look-in.

Alternatively, you can browse used BMW models, and you can sell your car for what it’s really worth. WhatCar: What Car? says...The BMW 2 Series Active Tourer and other MPVs have been suffering at the hands of SUVs in recent years.

      "[Ollama] Processing textbmw, 3-series, Is the BMW 3 Series a good car? The BMW 3 Series is like Alan Shearer. No, it’s not from Newcastle, but like Shearer it has for generations been a reliable and impressive performer, able to out-shine European and world opposition at the highest level, and is still going strong even in its advancing years. While Audi might be re-inventing the A4 as the new A5 (rather confusingly) and Mercedes has brought out a new C-Class while BMW was just updating the 3 Series, this is still a car that looks and feels totally cutting edge, especially in how it drives. Though if you would also consider an electric car, the Tesla Model 3 feels more futuristic still. In terms of styling, the most recent round of updates for the 3 Series haven’t changed that much. There’s been some small nipping and tucking around the lights and grille, some new wheels and paint options, but the overall shape and style remains the same. That’s both good and bad — good in that, overall, the 3 Series is still a handsome thing. Bad in that it hasn’t addressed some design mis-steps, such as the way the 3 looks overly bulky around the rear wheelarches. Basic Sport models get chrome trim around the radiator grille, while M-Sport models look a little more glowering with blacked-out trim. Watch: Audi A4 v BMW 3 Series v Genesis G70 v Mercedes C-Class It’s in the cabin that you’ll find the bigger changes. BMW has binned the (rather attractive) separate digital instruments and infotainment screen in favour of the big, curved, combined screen setup taken from other models such as the 4 Series and 5 Series. This means that the 3 Series now has the latest and most up to date infotainment software — which can update itself via over-the-air links — but even though the old iDrive click-wheel has been retained, there are some fiddly bits to find your way around on the screens, and the graphics don’t look quite as nice as they used to. Space in the cabin remains unchanged, which means you get just enough for four adults to sit in reasonable comfort, but there’s not the stretch-out space you’d find elsewhere. The boot is practical, especially in the Touring estate, but remember that the plug-in hybrid 330e — a hugely popular model with business user-choosers — loses quite a lot of that space to the battery, to the point where a basic VW Golf hatchback has a bigger boot. Not that you’ll care about boot space much when you’re sitting up in the driver’s seat. The BMW 3 Series has long been considered the best of its breed to drive, and that hasn’t changed, despite the fact it’s bigger and heavier now than it has ever been. While we have to wait to see what Audi has cooked up with the new A5 saloon, the 3 Series most definitely has the beating of the otherwise-impressive Mercedes C-Class when it comes to the driving experience. This is still a car that looks and feels totally cutting edge, especially in the way it drives Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The engine range has shrunk somewhat in the past few years — your choice at the base of the BMW 3 Series lineup is now restricted to the petrol 320i or the plug-in hybrid 330e. Bye-bye diesel 320d — we shall miss your combo of easy-going performance and exceptional economy, though there are plenty of excellent used examples to be found. In fact, there are now no diesel 3 Series models at all, something of a shock when you remember how wildly successful they have been over the years. Mind you, the 330e looks like it might be settling into the 320d’s economy shoes, not least because a big battery upgrade now means that it can do as much as 62 miles on electric power alone, if you remember to charge up the battery (which can’t, alas, be fast-charged from public DC chargers). Of course, if it’s serious performance you want — but you don’t fancy the expense and insurance cost of stepping up to a full-on M3 — there’s the brilliant M340i with its 374hp, straight-six, 3.0-litre turbo engine.

      "[Ollama] Processing textbmw, 3-series, Is the BMW 3 Series a good car? The BMW 3 Series is like Alan Shearer. No, it’s not from Newcastle, but like Shearer it has for generations been a reliable and impressive performer, able to out-shine European and world opposition at the highest level, and is still going strong even in its advancing years. While Audi might be re-inventing the A4 as the new A5 (rather confusingly) and Mercedes has brought out a new C-Class while BMW was just updating the 3 Series, this is still a car that looks and feels totally cutting edge, especially in how it drives. Though if you would also consider an electric car, the Tesla Model 3 feels more futuristic still. In terms of styling, the most recent round of updates for the 3 Series haven’t changed that much. There’s been some small nipping and tucking around the lights and grille, some new wheels and paint options, but the overall shape and style remains the same. That’s both good and bad — good in that, overall, the 3 Series is still a handsome thing. Bad in that it hasn’t addressed some design mis-steps, such as the way the 3 looks overly bulky around the rear wheelarches. Basic Sport models get chrome trim around the radiator grille, while M-Sport models look a little more glowering with blacked-out trim. Watch: Audi A4 v BMW 3 Series v Genesis G70 v Mercedes C-Class It’s in the cabin that you’ll find the bigger changes. BMW has binned the (rather attractive) separate digital instruments and infotainment screen in favour of the big, curved, combined screen setup taken from other models such as the 4 Series and 5 Series. This means that the 3 Series now has the latest and most up to date infotainment software — which can update itself via over-the-air links — but even though the old iDrive click-wheel has been retained, there are some fiddly bits to find your way around on the screens, and the graphics don’t look quite as nice as they used to. Space in the cabin remains unchanged, which means you get just enough for four adults to sit in reasonable comfort, but there’s not the stretch-out space you’d find elsewhere. The boot is practical, especially in the Touring estate, but remember that the plug-in hybrid 330e — a hugely popular model with business user-choosers — loses quite a lot of that space to the battery, to the point where a basic VW Golf hatchback has a bigger boot. Not that you’ll care about boot space much when you’re sitting up in the driver’s seat. The BMW 3 Series has long been considered the best of its breed to drive, and that hasn’t changed, despite the fact it’s bigger and heavier now than it has ever been. While we have to wait to see what Audi has cooked up with the new A5 saloon, the 3 Series most definitely has the beating of the otherwise-impressive Mercedes C-Class when it comes to the driving experience. This is still a car that looks and feels totally cutting edge, especially in the way it drives Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The engine range has shrunk somewhat in the past few years — your choice at the base of the BMW 3 Series lineup is now restricted to the petrol 320i or the plug-in hybrid 330e. Bye-bye diesel 320d — we shall miss your combo of easy-going performance and exceptional economy, though there are plenty of excellent used examples to be found. In fact, there are now no diesel 3 Series models at all, something of a shock when you remember how wildly successful they have been over the years. Mind you, the 330e looks like it might be settling into the 320d’s economy shoes, not least because a big battery upgrade now means that it can do as much as 62 miles on electric power alone, if you remember to charge up the battery (which can’t, alas, be fast-charged from public DC chargers). Of course, if it’s serious performance you want — but you don’t fancy the expense and insurance cost of stepping up to a full-on M3 — there’s the brilliant M340i with its 374hp, straight-six, 3.0-litre turbo engine. Whisper it, but that’s actually a more enjoyable car to drive even than the mighty M3 itself. If you want to bag yourself a great deal, check out Carwow’s BMW 3 Series deals.

      "[Ollama] Processing textbmw, 4-series, Is the BMW 4 Series a good car? The BMW 4 Series is an upmarket coupe that seats four and is designed to be more stylish and fun to drive than the BMW 3 Series saloon on which it’s based. It’s also more fun than its main alternatives, the Audi A5 and Mercedes C-Class Coupe. The two-door 4 Series Coupe sits in a family of 4 Series models, along with the convertible and five-door Gran Coupe models, while the BMW i4 is the electric version of the regular 4 Series Coupe, with the coupe and convertible getting updates in 2024. But in terms of styling, if the German coupes were in an orchestra, the Audi and Mercedes would be tickling the triangle while the BMW tries its best on the tuba – that grille makes the most noise. Some will like it and some really won’t. Still, beyond that, the 4 Series is a good looking car. Its aggressive creases, sporty body kit and sloping roofline make it a sort of half-price BMW 8 Series. Inside, it’s not as in-your-face as a C-Class in terms of design, but it’s classier and the levels of quality are better than in both Mercedes and Audi. In Mercedes’ larger cars its infotainment system narrowly beats BMW’s for visual drama and the way it works, but in the 4 Series and C-Class (where Mercedes fits its older systems), it’s the BMW that takes the win. The BMW’s looks better, works better and comes with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Praise be. Audi’s system comes a close third on all fronts. The range-topping M440i is brilliant, but most people will love the 420i M Sport. Head to our deals page for the very best prices! Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The 4 Series has seating for four people and those in the front seats will have all the space they need. The driver gets a good amount of adjustment, but it’s disappointing that lumbar adjustment – good for staying comfortable on long drives – isn’t standard and only comes as part of a very expensive pack. Grrr. The rear seats are fine for legroom, even for adults, but they’ll struggle with head room if they are anywhere close to six foot. Getting in and out of the back is a struggle too, because there are no rear doors – but hey, it’s a coupe. Still, the 4 Series’ boot is a generous 440 litres, which is only slightly smaller than an A5’s and some way bigger than the C-Class Coupe’s. There’s lots of engine choice, and there isn’t a bad one. There are 2.0-litre and 3.0-litre petrol and diesels, ranging from 184hp to 374hp, but the majority of people will find the 184hp 420i 2.0-litre petrol a great choice. Do more motorway miles? The 190hp 420d 2.0-litre diesel will cruise more efficiently. If you want maximum punch, the M440d diesel and M440i petrol both have powerful six-cylinder engines with startling performance. Then there’s the high-performance BMW M4, which we have reviewed separately. Handily, all 4 Series models are huge fun to drive. They’re lower and stiffer than a BMW 3 Series, and turn into corners with more agility than an A5 or C-Class Coupe. The xDrive all-wheel drive system is available with the 420d and standard on the M440 models for added security in slippery conditions, plus BMW offers things like upgraded brakes, a sports differential and adaptive suspension to really spice things up. The M models get this as standard. That agility does mean the 4 Series feels harder over bumps in town, even in its most comfortable driving mode, but otherwise, its standard parking sensors and rear camera make light work of parking. On the motorway, the suspension feels less abrupt and the 4 Series cruises quietly, but like the lumbar support, BMW’s clever adaptive cruise control with lane-keep steering assist costs a fortune to add as part of a pack. More grrr. Despite these minor setbacks, we think the 4 Series is the best of its breed. See how much you could save on a new BMW 4 Series with carwow, or check out our latest used BMWs.

      "[Ollama] Processing textbmw, 5-series, Is the BMW 5 Series a good car? Think of an all-rounder, and two things are likely to spring to mind. First will be a Swiss army knife – the global icon for ‘a thing that does everything’ – and the next could well be the BMW 5 Series. Since debuting five decades ago, this posh German saloon has proven time and again that it can offer comfort, bags of practicality, the latest technology and serious performance. It’s a similar story with its two key alternatives – if you’re considering a 5 Series you should also take a look at the Mercedes E-Class and Audi A6. Or perhaps the Lexus ES if you want a left-field option. The latest 5 Series clearly takes hints from BMW’s recent bold design direction as seen on the likes of the 2 Series Coupe and XM, albeit a little more subdued. That said, its styling is rather challenging, lacking the elegance of its predecessors. There are odd, incohesive lines around the headlights and front bumper, a front grille that seemingly mimics beaver teeth and the rear end looks like the designers couldn’t agree on what to do so gave up halfway through the process. Watch: All-electric BMW i5 review It’s a different story inside, with BMW’s latest infotainment system present and correct, combining a 12.3-inch digital drivers’ display with a 14.9-inch central screen. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are included as standard, and operate wirelessly. The overall design is pretty good and although some of the physical buttons have disappeared, forcing you to use the touchscreen more, there are high quality materials and solid build quality to make up for it. Artificial leather upholstery comes as standard, though you can opt for the real stuff, as well as a part-Alcantara choice if you’d prefer. So you get all the good tech, but if practicality is key, you might be a touch disappointed. Petrol-powered versions of the new 5 Series promise 520 litres of boot capacity, which is less than the Mercedes E-Class and Audi A6, though not by much. On the plus side, unlike those two cars the BMW’s boot doesn’t lose capacity in the plug-in hybrid version. A Touring estate version will arrive later if you need the extra room. The BMW 5 Series is available with one petrol engine, offering 208hp, and a pair of plug-in hybrid versions with up to 489hp. Notably, there’s no diesel version, which is a sign of the times given that this model is typically popular with those who rack up serious motorway mileage. The BMW 5 Series is comfortable to drive and has a lovely interior – shame the outside just looks so… bleugh Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer It’s goodbye to diesel, but hello to electric for the first time in a 5 Series. The i5 – reviewed separately here – will do up to 361 miles on a charge, but is quite a bit more expensive than the petrol-powered model. As you might expect, the BMW 5 Series is a comfortable and refined motorway cruiser. There’s a little bit of wind and road noise but overall it’s a relaxing way to rack up miles. However, BMWs usually excel at also being great fun on a twisty road, but the latest 5 Series is a bit disappointing in this regard. The steering is numb and doesn’t give much feedback about how much grip the tyres have, while the car just generally lacks the eagerness to turn into a corner that made old versions so much fun to drive.

      "[Ollama] Processing textbmw, 5-series-touring, Is the BMW 5 Series Touring a good car? The BMW 5 Series Touring is a posh estate car with a plug-in hybrid engine that makes it ideal as a practical family car, or for company car drivers looking for something comfortable to rack up miles in. It’s a bit like a Burberry backpack, because it’s posh and practical in equal measure. SUVs might be the on-trend choice, but there are plenty of estate alternatives to consider if you prefer to sit lower in the car. Other posh estates include the Audi A6 Avant and Mercedes E-Class Estate, or you could opt for a well-specced Volkswagen Passat. The 5 Series Touring isn’t the best-looking car, with odd angular lines in the bodywork that never feel quite as cohesive as more elegantly styled generations of old. Things get better inside, though, with a clean design for the most part. You get a smart piece of trim splitting the dashboard widthways and a pair of screens above this. BMW’s infotainment tech is some of the best in the business, with crisp displays and intuitive menu navigation. Aesthetically challenged on the outside, but the BMW 5 Series Touring should be a comfortable, practical estate car Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Boot space is up on the BMW 5 Series Saloon, increasing from that car’s 520 litres to 570 litres. Not a huge leap, but the more boxy shape should make it easier to load large items. It’s worth noting the Mercedes E-Class Estate has a roomier boot than this and the Audi A6 Avant, with the BMW’s boot the smallest of the trio. At launch, there’s just the one plug-in hybrid engine option. Called 530e, it combines a 2.0-litre petrol engine with an electric motor to make 184hp, while the battery provides a range of nearly 60 miles. This will be particularly appealing to company car drivers because of the favourable Benefit-in-Kind rate, though for the same reason the all-electric i5 Touring is also worth a look. Another plug-in hybrid, as well as a regular petrol engine, will join the line-up later. Although we’ve not been behind the wheel of this new model just yet, it’s likely to drive very much like the 5 Series Saloon. As such, you can expect a refined and comfortable car that’s at its best at motorway speeds, though perhaps not as much fun on a twisty road as its predecessors. If you’re interested in this car, find out how much you could save with Carwow’s BMW 5 Series Touring deals.

      "[Ollama] Processing textbmw, i4, Is the BMW i4 a good car? The BMW i4 is like a 4 Series from a decade in the future. It shares a very similar outline, but uses all-electric power and has a slightly bolder design, as well as having a more advanced interior. It certainly won’t fade into the background, as BMW has fitted the huge kidney grille from the 4 Series Gran Coupe that the i4 is based on. In the cabin, the i4 has a plush finish to match other BMW models – it definitely feels more upmarket in here than a Tesla Model 3, and can match a Polestar 2. Entry-level models come with cloth seat trim as standard, but leather is also on offer for those wanting a high-end feel. Regardless, it’s a well-built and neatly designed cabin, but the infotainment is the star of the show and features the impressive curved display combining the 12.3-inch instrument and 14.9-inch infotainment screens in one sleek unit. Compared to the 4 Series Gran Coupe, it’s 6mm taller and sits 15mm closer to the road – but remains mostly the same. Taller passengers may struggle to fit in the rear due to the sloping roof line, but knee room is acceptable. As it’s based on a conventional fuel-powered car, there isn’t a flat floor in the footwell, so fitting three adults in will be a struggle. However, the door openings are a good size and it is more than comfortable enough. You’ll be happy to hear that it’s quite spacious in the boot, with the hatchback tailgate opening up to provide a roomy load space. The rear seats fold down to reveal a flat floor, too. The BMW i4 is the all-electric cousin of the 4 Series Gran Coupe. The M50 version is as fast as an M3 to 60mph, just not quite as fun to drive Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The i4 comes in three versions. The entry-level eDrive35 has 282hp and claims up to 299 miles of range, while the eDrive40 ups this to 366 miles courtesy of a larger battery. That version comes with a 340hp rear-mounted electric motor setup that also produces 430Nm. The top-spec i4 M50 version – which was developed by BMW's M division – is fitted with two electric motors. With one fitted on each axle, the M50 comes with four-wheel drive and has a stout 544hp and 795Nm on tap. With the same sized battery as the eDrive40, though, claimed range is reduced to up to 318 miles. Whichever i4 you want, performance isn’t an issue. Even the eDrive35 models can do the sprint to 62mph in 6.0 seconds. But if you want brutal electric acceleration, the M50 gets to 62mph in 3.9 seconds (we bettered that in our video, however). Top speed is 140mph, though, rather than the usual 155, because the range of an EV really suffers at high speed. In town, the i4 feels very comfortable over bumps and cracks in the surface thanks to air suspension at the rear, and it’s pretty nimble as well. M50 models come with adaptive suspension for further comfort, meaning that even the higher-performance model can deal nicely with poorer surfaces. As standard, the i4 features adaptive cruise control and a reversing camera – making driving on the motorway and parking much simpler respectively. Refinement is also excellent throughout the i4 line-up, with only tyre noise making an impression. If the i4 sounds like the model for you, check out our deals page to see what price you can get for this stylish electric four-door. If you're interested in waiting to see some used examples of the BMW i4 then head over to our used BMW i4 page. WhatCar: What Car? says...If you’re eyeing up an electric car but don’t fancy broadcasting it to the world, the BMW i4 could be for you.

      "[Ollama] Processing textbmw, i5, Is the BMW i5 a good car? The BMW i5 is a bit like an alcohol-free pilsner. You still enjoy the refreshing taste of German lager, but it’s better for you – or in this case the planet. You see, the new i5 is the all-electric version of the latest BMW 5 Series. So you can choose a traditional pilsner if you can live with an internal-combustion hangover, or pick the EV if you want to wake up feeling refreshed and virtuous in the morning. If you plan to stick with a conventionally powered BMW for a while longer, have a read of our review of the 5 Series. Here we’re focusing on the all-electric i5, and spoiler alert, it's good. The two models look broadly similar from the outside. With a smaller grille than some recent BMWs, the styling isn’t as divisive as other current Beemers. It’s a bit more understated, but it's certainly not a looker – though we have a feeling that the looks will grow on us as we become more used to the design. A slow-burner, maybe. There are two power outputs to choose from. The less powerful is the i5 eDrive40, which has one 340hp motor powering the rear wheels. Step up to the M60 for two electric motors, one for the front wheels and one for the rears. Being four-wheel drive has to be a good thing when the car has 601hp. The regular eDrive40 is quick, with a 0-62mph time of six seconds. The M60 reaches 62mph in a kidney-bruising 3.8 seconds. Both models have the same battery pack, with an 81.2 kWh usable capacity. In the less powerful, lighter model, that gives an official range of up to 357 miles, dropping to a maximum of 315 miles for the heavier range-topper. That compares with 376 miles for a Mercedes EQE 350, one of the alternatives that could be on your shortlist if you are looking for an upmarket electric saloon. Will you be able to travel that far in the real world? Well, the way you drive will make a big difference. When Mat drove the M60 in Portugal the range was closer to 200 miles, but car reviewers aren’t renowned for driving gently. Assume that’s a worst-case scenario, and the official numbers are a best case. The i5 has a lovely interior and incredible performance, it's just a shame it doesn't go a bit further on a charge Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Plenty of electric cars are fast in a straight line, but BMWs are supposed to be fun around corners as well. The i5 corners with poise, especially cars with adaptive sports suspension and active anti-roll bars. The trouble is, the i5 is heavier than the regular 5 Series saloon, weighing as much as a big 4x4. The M60 is especially heavy, which is a shame as the car doesn’t feel as light on its feet as we’d hope. Get carried away and the front tyres push wide surprisingly early. Drive more steadily and the i5 is remarkably comfortable and super-quiet, with only a murmur of wind and road noise. Inside, the cabin is a high-tech banquet for the eyes, with a huge twin-screen display and an exceptional standard of finish. Even lower down the dash and doors there’s no sign of penny-pinching. Only the brittle action of the indicator stalks feels less than premium. There’s plenty of space front and rear, too, although the big transmission tunnel that exists for the internal-combustion-engined 5 Series gets in the way if there are three passengers in the back. The car is packed with clever tech, although frustratingly perhaps the smartest technology of all isn’t available in the UK. The optional upgrade for the adaptive cruise control available in some markets will change lanes for you. All the driver needs to do is look in their mirrors to check that it’s safe, and the car’s sensors can tell that you’ve looked to the side and will swap lanes. Where legal, the driver can even take their hands off the wheel. The eye activation feature is launching initially in Germany, the USA and Canada. A UK launch date for the automated lane-changing function has not been confirmed. So, clever, quick, and very good to drive – if not quite great compared with BMW’s greatest hits of the past. Next to other electric saloons, though, the i5 is pretty much as good as it gets, and if you need a bit more practicality, a BMW i5 Touring is coming later this year.

WhatCar: What Car? says...While many people dream of being driven around in a luxury limo, few of us will ever be able to afford either the car or a chauffeur. The BMW i5 might be the answer: it promises first-class comfort at a more attainable business-class price.You see, the i5 is the all-electric version of the BMW 5 Series executive saloon. Indeed, the two look almost identical – the i5 wears a few \"i\" badges and has blanked-off front vents that help boost aerodynamics, but that’s about it.The line-up is simple, with a standard eDrive40 model and a sportier M60 xDrive to choose from. Whichever i5 you go for, you get an 81.2kWh (usable capacity) battery that should be good for around 250-300 miles in real-world driving.BMW i5 video reviewSo, what else might you be considering if you want an electric luxury car? Well, the Mercedes EQE is the i5's main rival, but if you can spend a bit more, you could also look at the Porsche Taycan – a sporty take on the electric saloon., Carwow \\\\ Whatcar...\n",

Where legal, the driver can even take their hands off the wheel. The eye activation feature is launching initially in Germany, the USA and Canada. A UK launch date for the automated lane-changing function has not been confirmed. So, clever, quick, and very good to drive – if not quite great compared with BMW’s greatest hits of the past. Next to other electric saloons, though, the i5 is pretty much as good as it gets, and if you need a bit more practicality, a BMW i5 Touring is coming later this year. Click the link to see how much a BMW i5 will cost you through Carwow, or have a look at the latest savings on BMW’s entire model range. We’ve also got plenty of used BMWs for sale via our trusted dealers, and when you’ve found your new car, you can sell your car online through Carwow too. WhatCar: What Car? says...While many people dream of being driven around in a luxury limo, few of us will ever be able to afford either the car or a chauffeur. The BMW i5 might be the answer: it promises first-class comfort at a more attainable business-class price.You see, the i5 is the all-electric version of the BMW 5 Series executive saloon. Indeed, the two look almost identical – the i5 wears a few \"i\" badges and has blanked-off front vents that help boost aerodynamics, but that’s about it.The line-up is simple, with a standard eDrive40 model and a sportier M60 xDrive to choose from. Whichever i5 you go for, you get an 81.2kWh (usable capacity) battery that should be good for around 250-300 miles in real-world driving.BMW i5 video reviewSo, what else might you be considering if you want an electric luxury car? Well, the Mercedes EQE is the i5's main rival, but if you can spend a bit more, you could also look at the Porsche Taycan – a sporty take on the electric saloon., Carwow \\\\ Whatcar...\n",

      "[Ollama] Processing textbmw, i5-touring, Is the BMW i5 Touring a good car? The BMW i5 Touring is an electric estate car, which means it’s a very rare thing indeed. You get the same posh interior and silent running as the i5 saloon, but with a bit more practicality. It’s like a North Face duffle bag, because it’s big, practical and has designer appeal. It's also extremely good - so good, it picked up Highly Commended in the Comfortable Cruiser category of the 2025 Carwow Car of the Year Awards. As it stands, the only other electric estates in this price range are the Volkswagen ID7 Tourer and the Audi A6 Avant e-tron, so you might also cross-shop the i5 Touring with electric SUVs such as the BMW iX, Audi Q8 e-tron and Polestar 3. BMW’s modern styling is certainly an acquired taste, but with the i5 we’re either getting used to it or the styling department is finding its groove, because it’s a much more cohesive design than other recent models such as the iX. There are plenty of sharp angles and creases in the bodywork that give it a distinctive appearance, though base models get softer styling that looks a bit plain. There can be no complaints about the interior though, because it’s a lovely place to eat up miles. The seats are soft and there are quality materials throughout, and all trim levels get the same high quality twin-screen infotainment displays. They look great with clear graphics, though the menus can be really confusing to navigate around. BMW i5 Touring: electric range, battery and charging data Range: 279 - 343 milesEfficiency: 3.0 - 3.7 miles/kWhBattery size: 84kWhMax charge speed: 205kWCharge time AC: 12h 30mins, 0-100%, 7.4kWCharge time DC: 30mins, 10-80%, 205kWCharge port location: Right side rearPower outputs: 340hp / 601hp It’s spacious too, with plenty of adjustment to get yourself comfortable – you don’t get the same commanding view as an SUV, but the upside is that you feel more snug within the cockpit, rather than sat atop it. Storage is good in the front and there’s loads of room in the back seats, too. The main advantage of the estate body shape is that the BMW i5 Touring has a big boot – at 570 litres it should be enough space for the vast majority of people, and more space than any of the electric SUVs mentioned above, though the VW ID7 Tourer estate has more space still if you really need it. There are two motor options to choose between, with the eDrive40 being the more affordable car to buy and to run, with a top-of-the-range M60 also available with ludicrous performance at the expense of range. As such, the eDrive40 can go up to 348 miles between charges, compared with 314 miles for the M60, which puts it behind what alternatives such as the Audi A6 Avant e-tron (437 miles) and Polestar 3 (403 miles) are capable of. The BMW i5 Touring is an incredibly comfortable and refined car, and the practical boot is the icing on the cake Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Regardless, the way the BMW i5 Touring chews through those miles is incredibly impressive, because it’s one of the most comfortable, quiet and refined cars on sale today. You feel utterly cocooned from the outside world. That means it’s a great motorway cruiser, but also means pothole-riddled inner-city roads and bumpy B-roads do little to unsettle the car. It’s fairly composed going around corners, with little in the way of body roll, but you really do feel its weight, so it’s not a car that encourages you to drive it like a sports car. However, if you’re looking for a comfortable and refined car to cruise around in, the BMW i5 Touring has very few weak points, most of which are worthy sacrifices for something so comfortable and practical. If you’re interested, check out the latest BMW i5 Touring deals available on Carwow, or if you don’t need all that space we have i5 Saloon deals, too.

      "[Ollama] Processing textbmw, ix, Is the BMW iX a good car? This big, striking SUV is the BMW iX, the German brand’s biggest electric model and an alternative to other luxury SUVs, such as the Polestar 4 and Mercedes EQE SUV. You might also consider it as a posher alternative to the Kia EV9 if you don’t need all that space. An electric family SUV isn’t a particularly wild concept these days, but it seems no one told BMW’s designers. Like so many of the brand’s other cars, the iX has a really striking exterior design. It’s a bit like Marmite – you might love it, you might hate it, but it’s hard not to have an opinion either way. From those sharp lines and creases on its bonnet and wheelarches; to its big alloys, massive, toothy grille and squinty headlights – it’s certainly a very busy-looking design. In white in particular, you could say that it looks like someone crashed the Space Shuttle Discovery into the back of some sort of giant robotic beaver. Someone should probably tell NASA… Its dimensions are more conventional, being roughly comparable to the current X5 SUV on the outside, but with an interior that’s closer to the bigger X7 in terms of the space. And while you won’t get the option of seven seats on this new electric SUV, its cabin doesn’t skimp on any sense of luxury, tech or eco appeal. BMW iX: electric range, battery and charging data Range: 259-377 milesEfficiency: 2.8-3.1 miles per kWhBattery size: 74kWh / 108kWhMax charge speed: 250kWCharge time AC: 11hrs, 0-100%, 7kW / 16hrs 15mins, 0-100%, 7kWCharge time DC: 31mins, 10-80%, 250kW / 35 mins, 10-80%, 250kWCharge port location: Right rearPower outputs: 322hp / 516hp / 610hp That tech appeal is emphasised by a pair of huge screens that dominate the cabin. The 12.3-inch instrument panel and 14.9-inch infotainment display combine almost seamlessly to look like one big, curved display – it's an impressive sight from behind the wheel. You get a wireless charge pad, multiple USB-C ports and a range of connected services too. Build quality is top notch, and it’s very practical too with lots of space for five adults to stretch out. Boot space could be a bit more generous, though. With a 500-litre capacity, there’s less room for bags than you’ll find in the Polestar 4. You can choose from three power outputs, depending on whether you are happy with a quick car or you feel the need to warp the fabric of space and time. All three have an electric motor at each axle for all-wheel drive and a battery pack housed low down beneath the floor. The entry-level 326hp xDrive40 model has an official range of up to 264 miles, while the 523hp xDrive50 has a bigger battery that will see it travel up to 383 miles on a charge. If that’s not quick enough for you, the iX M60 has 619hp, a range of up to 349 miles, and a 0-60mph time of under four seconds. The cars have slightly different maximum charge rates (150kW for the xDrive40 and 200kW for the xDrive50 and M60), but the long and short of it is that any iX will be able to use a DC rapid charger to go from 10-80% capacity in less than 40 minutes. Plug in at home with a 7kW charger, and a full recharge will take up to 16 hours. The BMW iX is one of the best electric SUVs to drive, and has one of the coolest interiors, too Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Whichever model you go for, the BMW iX is one of the best electric SUVs to drive. It might be big, but excellent visibility makes it pretty easy to navigate tight city streets, while the air suspension on xDrive50 models smooths out bumps in the road for a comfortable drive. Out on the motorway it's lovely and quiet, making long journeys relaxing, while each of the motor options will get you up to speed quickly. And when you take the iX down a twisty road it swaps serene comfort for surprising agility. This is still a big, heavy SUV, but it's one of the more capable electric SUVs in corners. All models have all-wheel drive, which helps offer reassuring grip as you accelerate out of bends.

      "[Ollama] Processing textbmw, ix1, Is the BMW iX1 a good car? The BMW iX1 is the German brand’s all-electric version of the ever-popular X1 SUV. The iX1 takes inspiration from the bulkier BMW iX flagship, while being the most compact family option of BMW's electric SUVs. It’s like getting the latest phone that’s one step down from the most advanced version but still on trend. Coming with the same exterior design as the latest X1, there are some blue tweaks alongside the kidney grille and angular headlights to mark out the electric version, but it's all very subtle. Sportier models also come with a more aggressive design. You get angular rear lights too with a 3D effect, plus a large rear window and sporty elements, such as the roof spoiler and low-end diffuser. Inside, there are few buttons cluttering the cabin – although that does mean you get fiddly infotainment and climate controls thanks to too many switches being removed. There’s also no iDrive control dial, which means you have to do all major functions through the touchscreen.

      "[Ollama] Processing textbmw, ix1, Is the BMW iX1 a good car? The BMW iX1 is the German brand’s all-electric version of the ever-popular X1 SUV. The iX1 takes inspiration from the bulkier BMW iX flagship, while being the most compact family option of BMW's electric SUVs. It’s like getting the latest phone that’s one step down from the most advanced version but still on trend. Coming with the same exterior design as the latest X1, there are some blue tweaks alongside the kidney grille and angular headlights to mark out the electric version, but it's all very subtle. Sportier models also come with a more aggressive design. You get angular rear lights too with a 3D effect, plus a large rear window and sporty elements, such as the roof spoiler and low-end diffuser. Inside, there are few buttons cluttering the cabin – although that does mean you get fiddly infotainment and climate controls thanks to too many switches being removed. There’s also no iDrive control dial, which means you have to do all major functions through the touchscreen. The design is pleasing on the whole though, with soft materials used up high and on all the main touch points. In the back there’s a decent amount of space, with good head and knee room. Although quality on the whole is fine, it takes a step down from the front part of the cabin. That being said, it still feels like a top product.

As with the petrol-powered X2, it’s based on the same mechanical package as the iX1 electric SUV, but gets sharper exterior styling that comes a little at the expense of practicality. It’s a bit like sports fleece jackets — the iX1 is a roomy and comfy fleece, designed for practicality, while the iX2 is more sporty and form-fitting, with a tailored look to it. The iX2 is entering a pretty crowded marketplace when it comes to stylish electric SUVs and crossovers — there’s already the choice of the Audi Q4 e-tron Sportback, the Volvo EC40, and of course the big-selling Tesla Model Y. On the outside, the iX2 looks very much the same as the petrol X2 — if you’re trying to tell them apart, really aside from the badges the only way to do so is to look at the grille, which is blanked-off for the iX2. If you fancy an electric car but maybe don’t fancy making too big a visual statement about it, that could be a good thing for you. BMW iX2: electric range, battery and charging data Range: 266-282 milesEfficiency: 3.6-3.8 miles per kWhBattery size: 64.8kWhMax charge speed: 130kWCharge time AC: 10hrs 0mins, 0-100%, 7kWCharge time DC: 29mins, 10-80%, 130kWCharge port location: Right rearPower outputs: 204hp / 313hp That sharply-sloping rear roofline certainly marks the iX2 out as being one of the more stylish and dramatic-looking electric SUVs you can buy — it’s definitely more interesting to look at than the slightly blobby Audi or Tesla — but it won’t be to everyone’s taste. Inside, the cabin looks and feels very modern and high-tech, but some of the materials used are too cheap when you’re shopping at the more expensive end of the iX2’s price list. The big, wide, curved-screen layout for the infotainment screen and the driver’s instruments looks great though, and it’s hugely responsive. The layout is fairly easy to find your way around, too, and the on-screen icons are large and easy to press, but there are a few too many complicated sub-menus for some functions. Practicality takes a hit compared to the iX1, as despite the boot being large on paper compared to most alternatives the sloping roof limits the size of loads that you can take. And while the rear seats are really roomy for two adults, the centre seat is almost useless - making the iX2 a four-seater except for very occasional use. With 313hp and all-wheel drive, the BMW iX2 has the performance to back up the car's sporty looks Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer BMW sells two versions of the iX2. Although they use the same size of battery, the more powerful all-wheel drive version doesn’t go as far on a charge as the less powerful two-wheel drive version, which can go 282 miles. The iX2 is as quiet and refined as you’d hope from an electric car, but while it does drive well, and can corner hard, there’s maybe not the gap between it and rivals from Volvo and Audi that there used to be. The steering is satisfying, although a little odd at times, and performance is ample. Like the iX1 it’s up there as one of the benchmarks in the sector. If you’re interested, check out the latest BMW iX2 deals on Carwow. You can also check out used BMW iX2s for sale, or other used BMWs here. And remember that when the time comes for car-changing you can even sell your car online through Carwow’s network of trusted dealers. WhatCar: What Car? says...It's been suggested the human attention span is shortening, and if that's true (are you still with us...?) we reckon the BMW iX2 could help reverse the trend.We’re referring to the iX2's attention-grabbing styling. With its chunky SUV body, sleek coupé-like roof and a front grille that resembles a pair of neighbouring caves or huge nostrils, this electric SUV has looks that should make people stop to inspect the details.Whether, after inspection, they decide the iX2 is a beauty or a beast is another matter, but it’ll get owners noticed more than if they were in the closely related BMW iX1, which has a more traditional boxy shape.If you decide you want one, there's no need to choose a trim level or battery size because there's only one of each, but there are two power options, one with four-wheel drive. There's also a petrol version, which you can read about in our BMW X2 review.So is the BMW iX2 a worthy competitor to the best electric SUVs with coupé looks, ranging from the Audi Q4 Sportback e-tron and Skoda Enyaq Coupé to the Volvo EC40?

      "[Ollama] Processing textbmw, ix3, Is the BMW iX3 a good car? The BMW iX3 is the company’s electric SUVs and an alternative to the Audi e-tron, Mercedes EQC, Ford Mustang Mach-E and Skoda Enyaq. It’s the BMW equivalent of the Monsters Inc story. Until now, the company has used scary old petrol and diesel to generate power, but now they’ve found out that laugh-a-minute electricity actually works a whole lot better for everybody, and makes you smile, too. So the iX3 is new, but just doesn’t look it. Up front, there’s the usual BMW grille, but it’s all a clever ruse because it doesn’t have to cool an engine, so it has been sealed to help reduce drag and give the car’s range a small boost. A dimpled pattern breaks up what would otherwise be a big sheet of black plastic. The 20-inch wheels are unique to the BMW iX3, too. Their heavily sculpted design helps to smooth airflow along the side of the car, improving range, although they look exceptionally vulnerable to kerbing. Assorted blue highlights to designate the electric model dotted around the iX3 – most obviously on the rear bumper where you’d normally spot some exhaust pipes – finish off the styling changes. There are also blue highlights around the ‘grille’, the badges and the sills. EV Range Test: Audi Q4 e-tron v BMW iX3 v Hyundai Ioniq 5 v Kia EV6 v Skoda Enyaq Under the skin is a solitary 286hp electric motor that also generates 400Nm of torque and drives the rear wheels. There’s an 80kWh battery pack that should give a range of up to 285 miles – that’s according to the latest official testing procedure. That’s a bit more than key alternatives such as the Audi e-tron and Mercedes-Benz EQC, but a bit less than the Jaguar I-Pace. In the real world it will be a bit below that, especially in cold, wet conditions. The iX3 should be compatible with almost every kind of charging station or power outlet, including super-fast 150kW chargers, which can give an 80% recharge in just 34 minutes. This means you can add 60-ish miles of range in about 10 minutes. There aren’t many 150kW chargers in the UK, but the network is growing. BMW iX3: electric range, battery and charging data Range: 286 - 290 milesEfficiency: 3.4-3.5 miles per kWhBattery size: 74kWhMax charge speed: 150kW / 250kWCharge time AC: 7hrs 30mins, 0-100%, 11kWCharge time DC: 34mins, 0-80%, 150kWCharge port location: Right rearPower outputs: 282hp Charging from less powerful outlets (such as a home wall-box charger or three-pin plug) will take longer – BMW reckons a full charge from empty will take around 12 hours. While electricity prices have risen lately, they’re not rising as fast as the cost of petrol or diesel, so an electric iX3 will still be much cheaper to run than a conventional X3. All electric cars feature brake regeneration – a system that uses the electric motor as an extra brake that can feed energy back to the batteries that would otherwise be lost as the car slows down. This always happens when you press the brake pedal, but the iX3 joins many of the latest electric cars by giving the system the ability to bring you to a stop when you lift off the accelerator pedal, too. It allows for one-pedal driving, which (once you’re used to it) is an extremely relaxing way of dealing with urban traffic. It’s not the fastest version of the X3, but it’s still pretty quick with a 0-60mph time of 6.8 seconds. Top speed is limited to 112mph, which helps to preserve range. It’s more than enough for UK drivers, anyway. The first thing you notice when you get out and about in your iX3 is how quiet it is. There’s no noise from the engine and transmission, so you only notice a little wind and road noise as your speed rises. A 285-mile range puts BMW right in the ballpark. It's better than a Mercedes EQC but not as good as a Jaguar I-Pace Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Adaptive suspension is fitted to the iX3 as standard, so it’s pretty comfortable, although a Mercedes EQC still trumps it for out-and-out ride quality. However, the suspension stops the iX3’s body from rolling too much during cornering. The iX3 grips strongly, too, and its handling is doubtless helped by the fact that the batteries are stored in the floor, lowering the centre of gravity. Flicking the suspension into Sport model firm things up a lot, to the extent that it makes the ride too firm, but it certainly sharpens the handling and gives the iX3 a distinctly sporty feel. All iX3s are well equipped. The entry-level M Sport comes with a 12.3-inch digital driver’s display and 12.3-inch touchscreen infotainment system, wireless phone charging, electrically adjustable leather seats, adaptive suspension (which lets you choose between soft, comfortable settings and stiffer, sportier ones) and a panoramic glass roof. The top-spec M-Sport Pro car has a Harman Kardon audio system, a head-up display and an automatic parking system. If the BMW iX3 is an upmarket electric SUV that ticks all the right boxes for you, make sure you check out our BMW iX3 deals page to find out how much you could save when buying through carwow. WhatCar: What Car? says...The BMW iX3 electric SUV marked a change of direction for the German brand – at least when it came to building cars that run on batteries.What do we mean by that? Well, when the iX3 first showed up, BMW’s only previous electric car was the much smaller BMW i3 hatchback, which was built from the ground up to run on electricity but looked a bit too futuristic for most to get on board with.The iX3 took a different approach: it's essentially an electric SUV version of the BMW X3 (a family SUV available with petrol and diesel engines). In fact the only features that mark it out visually from the X3 are the solid plastic grille, aerodynamic alloy wheels and a smattering of blue highlights.BMW iX3 video reviewIt’s been around for a long time now though, so is the BMW iX3 still good enough to compete with the best electric SUVs – from the Audi Q6 e-tron and the Mercedes EQE SUV to the Tesla Model Y. This review will tell you everything you need to know.OverviewThe BMW iX3 struggles to compete when it comes to charging speeds and range, but it makes up for that by being good to drive, practical and smart inside with a fab infotainment system. It’s still a fine buy if you’re looking for a big electric SUV.Good to driveGreat infotainment systemComparatively well pricedNot as fast as rivalsAudi Q6 e-tron is quieterShorter range than rivals Performance & driveWhat it’s like to drive, and how quiet it isStrengths+Good to drive+Comfortable ride+Quite refinedWeaknesses-Shorter range than rivalsIf you’re expecting the BMW iX3 to deliver Tesla-like performance, you’ll be mildly disappointed.

While electricity prices have risen lately, they’re not rising as fast as the cost of petrol or diesel, so an electric iX3 will still be much cheaper to run than a conventional X3. All electric cars feature brake regeneration – a system that uses the electric motor as an extra brake that can feed energy back to the batteries that would otherwise be lost as the car slows down. This always happens when you press the brake pedal, but the iX3 joins many of the latest electric cars by giving the system the ability to bring you to a stop when you lift off the accelerator pedal, too. It allows for one-pedal driving, which (once you’re used to it) is an extremely relaxing way of dealing with urban traffic. It’s not the fastest version of the X3, but it’s still pretty quick with a 0-60mph time of 6.8 seconds. Top speed is limited to 112mph, which helps to preserve range. It’s more than enough for UK drivers, anyway. The first thing you notice when you get out and about in your iX3 is how quiet it is. There’s no noise from the engine and transmission, so you only notice a little wind and road noise as your speed rises. A 285-mile range puts BMW right in the ballpark. It's better than a Mercedes EQC but not as good as a Jaguar I-Pace Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Adaptive suspension is fitted to the iX3 as standard, so it’s pretty comfortable, although a Mercedes EQC still trumps it for out-and-out ride quality. However, the suspension stops the iX3’s body from rolling too much during cornering. The iX3 grips strongly, too, and its handling is doubtless helped by the fact that the batteries are stored in the floor, lowering the centre of gravity. Flicking the suspension into Sport model firm things up a lot, to the extent that it makes the ride too firm, but it certainly sharpens the handling and gives the iX3 a distinctly sporty feel. All iX3s are well equipped. The entry-level M Sport comes with a 12.3-inch digital driver’s display and 12.3-inch touchscreen infotainment system, wireless phone charging, electrically adjustable leather seats, adaptive suspension (which lets you choose between soft, comfortable settings and stiffer, sportier ones) and a panoramic glass roof. The top-spec M-Sport Pro car has a Harman Kardon audio system, a head-up display and an automatic parking system.

WhatCar: What Car? says...The BMW iX3 electric SUV marked a change of direction for the German brand – at least when it came to building cars that run on batteries.What do we mean by that? Well, when the iX3 first showed up, BMW’s only previous electric car was the much smaller BMW i3 hatchback, which was built from the ground up to run on electricity but looked a bit too futuristic for most to get on board with.The iX3 took a different approach: it's essentially an electric SUV version of the BMW X3 (a family SUV available with petrol and diesel engines). In fact the only features that mark it out visually from the X3 are the solid plastic grille, aerodynamic alloy wheels and a smattering of blue highlights.BMW iX3 video reviewIt’s been around for a long time now though, so is the BMW iX3 still good enough to compete with the best electric SUVs – from the Audi Q6 e-tron and the Mercedes EQE SUV to the Tesla Model Y. This review will tell you everything you need to know.OverviewThe BMW iX3 struggles to compete when it comes to charging speeds and range, but it makes up for that by being good to drive, practical and smart inside with a fab infotainment system. It’s still a fine buy if you’re looking for a big electric SUV.Good to driveGreat infotainment systemComparatively well pricedNot as fast as rivalsAudi Q6 e-tron is quieterShorter range than rivals Performance & driveWhat it’s like to drive, and how quiet it isStrengths+Good to drive+Comfortable ride+Quite refinedWeaknesses-Shorter range than rivalsIf you’re expecting the BMW iX3 to deliver Tesla-like performance, you’ll be mildly disappointed.

      "[Ollama] Processing textbmw, x1, Is the BMW X1 a good car? The BMW X1 is the baby of the Bavarian brand’s SUV range, headed by the enormous X7 seven-seater. It may still be the entry level SUV model, but the current model is far removed from the awkward-looking compact SUV-inspired hatchback the X1 once was. Think of it as the youngest sibling in a large family. It’ll always be seen as the little one, but now it’s grown out of puberty, graduated university and it should be taken seriously. And the X1 really has grown, not just in character but in size being larger in every direction than the model that came before it. It’s a much better looking car now, with a bluff front end sporting a pair of squared-off grilles and aggressive headlights. It’s a boxy car all round, looking even larger than it is with sharp angles and crisp lines all over - especially in M Sport trim, whereas xLine cars ditch the aggressive body kit in favour of tough looking black cladding. The interior of the X1 is sleeker than the exterior, with a pared-down dashboard featuring a prominent pair of screens in a single wide display. They’re crisp and easy to read, but the infotainment menus can be a little overwhelming to use. BMW has opted to get rid of physical climate control buttons and use touch controls on the 10.7-inch screen instead, but it’s rather fiddly to use on the move. Otherwise the cabin layout is easy to navigate and pleasant on the eye, with minimalistic shapes and contrasting trims across the width of the dashboard to break up the design. Gone is the traditional gear level, with a tiny gear selector switch in its place instead. Space is good in both the front and back of the X1, especially with the sliding reach bench set all the way back. Tall adults won’t struggle for headroom and legroom at any position, though boot space is maximised with the bench all the way forwards. The X1 beats its German alternatives for boot space, at 540 litres versus the Audi Q3’s 530 litres and the Mercedes GLA’s 495 litres - though the Volvo XC40 has the X1 licked with its 578-litre boot. The BMW X1 is a great looking car in every trim level, and it's practical too. You get a range of engines to choose from, but it’s an expensive choice of small SUV - especially in M35i spec Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer BMW has given its small SUV a wide range of engine options, with the cheapest being the entry-level petrol model. There are fuel efficient plug-in hybrid options and a range-topping M35i high-performance model. All X1 models are good fun on a twisty road, but being a BMW it’s hardly a surprise. There’s little in the way of body lean when attacking corners and the steering isn’t too light for decent grip feel. It’s definitely sportier than alternatives such as the VW T-Roc and Skoda Kamiq. The M35i model is a cut above, but that’s to be expected with its BMW M135i roots. Motorways are a little noisier than you might expect from a posh SUV with some noticeable wind and road noise - especially on the larger optional wheels. In town the X1 can get shaken up over broken roads, but good all-round visibility, automatic gearboxes and a small turning circle make city driving a breeze. The X1 should be at the top of your list for a premium small family SUV, and you can check out Carwow’s BMW X1 deals here. If you know you want a BMW but you're not sure on the X1, have a look at other new BMW deals instead. You could also browse used X1s or other used BMW deals too.

      "[Ollama] Processing textbmw, x2, Is the BMW X2 a good car? The BMW X2 marks a dramatic departure from the previous model. The old X2 looks relatively plain and almost hatchback-like, but this new X2 gets sharper styling with a fastback rear and chunky sides, plus a big grille which optionally lights up at night. It won’t be to everyone’s taste, but it’s certainly more striking. Underneath, it’s using the same mechanical bits and pieces as the taller, more practical X1, so swapping to an X2 is a bit like kicking off your wedges and strapping on some stilettos — you can walk in both, but one is much more stylish than the other. There are several other sharply-styled SUVs you could consider, too. There’s the Audi Q3 Sportback, the Volvo EC40, the Lexus LBX, and the incoming Renault Rafale. The X2’s cabin is, of course, largely shared with the X1 and that means you get the impressive-looking curved screens atop the dashboard, which includes a big central infotainment screen and a digital instrument panel. A head-up display is also optional. For the most part, the cabin looks and feels quality, but there are some unpleasantly cheaper materials if you go looking. You do have to get used to operating almost everything through the touchscreen - including the climate controls and even some of the headlight controls, which is really annoying. But that’s a criticism that can be laid at the door of many of the X2’s alternatives. The X2 isn’t a case of style over substance - it’s good to drive and high-quality inside, but the starting price makes alternatives look cheap Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Surprisingly, the X2 doesn’t compromise its practicality too much compared to the X1. Yes, the sloping roof does mean that you can’t pack in big boxes like you can in the X1, but the actual boot volume below the luggage cover is slightly better. Space in the back seats is also fine, although you will notice that there’s less headroom and less light coming in than in the X1. You can choose from two petrol-engined options for the X2. There’s an entry level X2 20i, which uses a 2.0-litre turbo four-cylinder engine driving the front wheels through a seven-speed automatic gearbox. There’s also the X2 M35i, which also gets a four-cylinder turbo 2.0-litre engine, but which is amped-up to 300hp and has four-wheel drive and lower, firmer suspension. There’s also the all-electric BMW iX2, with a choice of two power outputs - we’ve reviewed this separately here.

      "[Ollama] Processing textbmw, x3, Is the BMW X3 a good car? The BMW X3 is an incredibly popular family SUV - more than 3.5 million have been sold since it launched in 2003. The latest model aims to stand out with its striking exterior design, ultra-modern interior and new plug-in hybrid engine. Both upmarket and eco-conscious, then, it’s like eating at a Nobu restaurant and ordering the vegan option. It’s one of BMW’s core SUV models, being larger than the X1 but smaller than the X5 - a true family SUV, making it an alternative to cars such as the Audi Q5, Mercedes GLC, Volvo XC60 and Alfa Romeo Stelvio. At the same time, many growing families may be looking to increasingly posh offerings from less upmarket brands as a way to get more bang for their buck - think the Hyundai Santa Fe or Volkswagen Tiguan. The old X3 did look a bit like it had been designed by a committee, starting with a generic SUV shape and just pasting on BMW’s signature features such as the kidney grilles and quad headlights. The new model is much more distinctive, with a very clean look helped in no small part by ditching the black plastic cladding that used to adorn the wheel arches. There’s also an eye-catching new grille which has a mixture of diagonal and vertical lines - though racier models get a more conventional look - and which can even be illuminated by a thin LED strip around the outside. The sides are smooth, with faint sculpting giving the suggestion of a wheel arch, and recessed door handles mean there’s nothing to protrude. It’s a similar story at the rear, which has a smooth tailgate and big, angular LED taillights. Inside it’s an even bigger change. There’s a large twin-screen infotainment setup and an interesting knitted texture on the dashboard, though it’s great to see BMW’s retained some of the features we love such as the rotary controller for the infotainment system that makes it much easier to use on the move than a pure touchscreen. The new X3 looks good and drives well - shame it’s not as nice inside as its predecessor Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The most obvious feature, though, is that where BMWs of old may have used tons of chrome trim, in the new X3 it’s largely been replaced with huge hunks of translucent plastic through which sophisticated ambient lighting shines. It’s quite effective, particularly at night, but it’s definitely an acquired taste and does highlight that the interior doesn’t feel quite as luxuriously built as the old car, with some quite cheap and nasty materials around. It’s also not hugely spacious for family life. The front seats are roomy but the rears are only average, and there’s a big hump in the floor which makes the centre seat quite uncomfortable. The boot is a good size at 570 litres, marginally larger than an Audi Q5 or Alfa Romeo Stelvio, but it’s beaten easily by a Mercedes GLC or a VW Tiguan. Storage for smaller items is also a bit limited. There are four engines to choose from in the UK. There’s a 2.0-litre petrol or 2.0-litre diesel, both of which provide plenty of performance for everyday life. The most interesting is the 30e plug-in hybrid, which has up to 56 miles of all-electric range - meaning low company car tax bills and big potential fuel savings. All of these models are fairly pleasant to drive with comfortable suspension and refined engines, though they’re not quite as enjoyable as the old X3 was. At the top of the range there’s a rapid M50 model, which has a 3.0-litre six-cylinder engine and plenty of performance upgrades making it a totally different car to drive. This version of the X3 takes aim at the Audi SQ5 and Mercedes-AMG GLC 43 and does so pretty well, thanks to tidy driving dynamics and plenty of performance.

If you said they both belong to families with an X in their name, congratulations – you win a gold star. But the real answer is that they’re both unstoppable blockbusters.By being bold and branching out alone, Deadpool & Wolverine sliced through box office records, earning well over a billion dollars. Meanwhile, BMW's family SUV superhero, the X3, has sold more than 3.5 million units and counting.Competition is hotting up though.

There’s a large twin-screen infotainment setup and an interesting knitted texture on the dashboard, though it’s great to see BMW’s retained some of the features we love such as the rotary controller for the infotainment system that makes it much easier to use on the move than a pure touchscreen. The new X3 looks good and drives well - shame it’s not as nice inside as its predecessor Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The most obvious feature, though, is that where BMWs of old may have used tons of chrome trim, in the new X3 it’s largely been replaced with huge hunks of translucent plastic through which sophisticated ambient lighting shines. It’s quite effective, particularly at night, but it’s definitely an acquired taste and does highlight that the interior doesn’t feel quite as luxuriously built as the old car, with some quite cheap and nasty materials around. It’s also not hugely spacious for family life. The front seats are roomy but the rears are only average, and there’s a big hump in the floor which makes the centre seat quite uncomfortable. The boot is a good size at 570 litres, marginally larger than an Audi Q5 or Alfa Romeo Stelvio, but it’s beaten easily by a Mercedes GLC or a VW Tiguan. Storage for smaller items is also a bit limited. There are four engines to choose from in the UK. There’s a 2.0-litre petrol or 2.0-litre diesel, both of which provide plenty of performance for everyday life. The most interesting is the 30e plug-in hybrid, which has up to 56 miles of all-electric range - meaning low company car tax bills and big potential fuel savings. All of these models are fairly pleasant to drive with comfortable suspension and refined engines, though they’re not quite as enjoyable as the old X3 was. At the top of the range there’s a rapid M50 model, which has a 3.0-litre six-cylinder engine and plenty of performance upgrades making it a totally different car to drive. This version of the X3 takes aim at the Audi SQ5 and Mercedes-AMG GLC 43 and does so pretty well, thanks to tidy driving dynamics and plenty of performance.

If you said they both belong to families with an X in their name, congratulations – you win a gold star. But the real answer is that they’re both unstoppable blockbusters.By being bold and branching out alone, Deadpool & Wolverine sliced through box office records, earning well over a billion dollars. Meanwhile, BMW's family SUV superhero, the X3, has sold more than 3.5 million units and counting.Competition is hotting up though. The latest Mercedes GLC is a fierce competitor (especially in plug-in hybrid form) plus there's the new Audi Q5 spoiling for a fight. Hence the X3, like a Marvel hero, has been forced to mutate.BMW X3 video reviewSo while this fourth-generation X3 sits on the same car platform as its predecessor, it's now longer, wider and lower, with a refreshed range of engines. The interior has had a complete overhaul too, with a new dashboard lay-out and the use of recycled materials. It’s like a mini BMW iX., Carwow \\\\ Whatcar...\n",

      "[Ollama] Processing textbmw, x4, Is the BMW X4 a good car? The BMW X4 is based on the old X3, and it’s a sleeker, sportier-looking SUV that tries to convince you that it’s a coupe. It sits between the X2 and the X6 in terms of size, and while it’s not as practical as the X3, it’s arguably the more stylish car. It’s like a chic tote bag instead of a big, roomy suitcase. Not as useful, but rather more fashionable. Inside, the X4 doesn’t have the high-tech, big-screen setup of the new X3, and nor does it have the latest tech boasted by the Mercedes GLC Coupe, but the quality levels are very high and it’s a well-designed cabin. While the X4 doesn’t get the new X3’s big, sweeping digital screen dashboard, it does stick with the old separate instrument panel and touchscreen, both 12.3 inches across. The big screen in the middle uses older iDrive software that’s still good to use, and it’s easier to control on the move than a touchscreen-only system thanks to the click-wheel controller down on the console. Up front, there’s plenty of space even if you’re tall, and the adjustable steering wheel and excellent sports seats mean that the driving position is both very good and very comfortable. In the back seats, legroom is fine but that sloping roofline means that tall rear seat passengers will find that their heads are brushing the ceiling, and it’s a bit dark and gloomy back there. The boot is actually pretty good — it holds just 45 litres less than the roomy new X3, at least when you measure up to the luggage cover — and the floor is flat, with no loading lip so it’s easy to heft heavy items up and into the boot. The rear seats fold flat, and they split 40:20:40 for maximum practicality, but you do lose a good bit of seats-down space compared to the X3 — a full 200 litres. If you’ve decided you like the looks and don’t mind the BMW X4’s reduced practicality, there’s plenty to like about the way it drives and presents itself inside Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The standard X4’s engine choice is limited to just two diesels now. If you go for a sporty M model, there’s a bit more choice, with a more powerful straight-six petrol and straight-six diesel, and even a full-on 510hp X4 M if you really want to go nuts. All models come with BMW’s xDrive four-wheel drive as standard, and all come with an eight-speed automatic gearbox. The X4 is actually quite frugal, at least in 2.0-litre xDrive20d diesel form. Thanks to that four-wheel drive system being able to disconnect the front wheels to save fuel, 49mpg is theoretically possible, with low-40s being a realistic goal. It’s still quick, hitting 62mph in 7.9 seconds, which is fine unless you truly crave the 3.8 seconds of the X4 M… For a big 4x4, the X4 is decent to drive, and keeps its composure when traversing a bumpy, twisty British B-road. The xDrive four-wheel drive sends a bit more power to the rear wheels than the fronts, allowing for a more enjoyable driving setup, but the steering isn’t as talkative as it ought to be, and so a Porsche Macan (the petrol one, not the electric one) makes a more engaging car on a challenging road. The X4 can be had with optional adaptive suspension, and this is a must. Not only does it sharpen up the handling for twisty roads, in Comfort mode it also makes the X4 noticeably more comfortable over bumps. Without the adaptive springs, it’s just not as comfy as a Mercedes GLC Coupe. The new BMW X3 is far more technologically advanced than this X4, and comes with the option of a plug-in hybrid engine, but if style is what matters, then the X4 is still worth considering.

WhatCar: What Car? says...Some people want a car that doesn’t attract too much attention, and if that sounds like you, steer clear of the BMW X4. This large SUV really stands out from the crowd thanks to its combination of bulky go-anywhere presence and a bit of coupé curviness.It's a formula that's proved pretty trendy. Indeed, the bigger BMW X6 set the ball rolling, offering luxury SUV devotees a more streamlined alternative to the BMW X5.Likewise, under the X4's sleek body you'll find the same platform as the BMW X3 has – and that's a highly accomplished large SUV in its own right.The X4 aims to be not only be the better looking version (we’ll leave that to you to decide), but also more entertaining to drive than it's stablemate, although those swoopy lines do make it a less practical choice.Other premium brands have gone down the same road as BMW by taking an existing SUV model and lowering sections of the roofline. For example, there's the Audi Q5 Sportback and the Mercedes GLC Coupé with similarly slinky styling. Then there's the Porsche Macan – a car that had sporty looks from the start., Carwow \\\\ Whatcar...\n",

      "[Ollama] Processing textbmw, x5, Is the BMW X5 a good car? There aren’t many cars that can do what the BMW X5 can do: it’s like a roomy, comfortable hot hatch on stilts. It’s genuinely enjoyable to drive, much more so than alternatives such as the Audi Q7 and Mercedes GLE. If you want to get something closer, you’ll need to head to a Porsche Cayenne, but that’s a bit like a 100-metre sprinter at a marathon – it isn’t quite as comfortable or practical for families over long distances - which helped the BMW X5 to win the Adventurer's Choice category of the 2025 Carwow Car of the Year Awards. The BMW X5 has most cars very much licked on the luxury front, though. Everywhere you prod there are luxurious materials and soft-touch plastic, from the top of the dashboard to the door tops. Sure, the overall design is slightly more conservative than that of a Mercedes GLE, but for some, that’ll be a good thing, and an update in 2023 brought a much more modern design to close the gap. You get BMW's excellent twin-screen setup on the dashboard. The curved displays look suitably modern, with the one on the right displaying all the relevant driving information and the one on the left for your infotainment. It's a touchscreen and really quick to respond to your inputs, but the menus are quite complicated to find your way around. Group test: Audi Q7 v BMW X5 v Mercedes GLE v Porsche Cayenne v VW Touareg Another important factor in a large luxury SUV is space and the BMW X5 offers plenty of it. Those in the front will have no complaints and the driver gets a supportive seat with full electric adjustment and a memory function. There’s plenty of space in the back seats, as well – two tall adults will sit comfortably behind those in the front, while a third won’t be sounding off on a long journey either. That spaciousness continues to the boot, with the X5 having 650 litres, which is a good chunk less than you get in an Audi Q7 and Porsche Cayenne, though the BMW is a bit more spacious than the Mercedes GLE. There are four engines to choose from. The plug-in hybrid will be the best option for those who can charge regularly, and it also has the lowest tax rate for company car buyers. There's a sporty petrol if running costs aren't a concern, but most people will find one of the diesels offers the best all-round experience. In town, the BMW X5, despite its size, isn’t daunting to manoeuvre thanks to good visibility for the driver through its tall wide windows and standard front and rear parking sensors. In fact, BMW includes its Parking Assistant, which will steer the car into a space for you and you can add rear-wheel steering as an option for better low-speed manoeuvrability. Porsche, Land Rover, Mercedes and Audi all make very good large SUVs, but the X5 is the best all-rounder for us Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer It’s a comfortable experience, too; the X5’s optional adaptive air suspension does a good job of soaking up ruts, potholes and broken Tarmac in its most comfortable setting. That said, the M Competition’s firmer suspension (in the name of going around corners more quickly) isn’t as comfy when the going gets rough. On twisty country roads, the BMW X5 steers with precision and on its standard suspension handles well – particularly in its firmer ‘sport’ setting. The M Competition’s still-firmer suspension props the X5 up even more effectively through bends and the range-topper is more agile to drive. But, calm things down to a cruise on the motorway, and all the engines are quiet, while wind and road noise are kept to a minimum. You do hear more road noise in the M50i and M Competition with their huge alloys and super-wide tyres, though.

Does anybody need a car that’s part SUV, part coupe? But like Snapchat, the X6 has defied the naysayers to prove quite popular. This large coupe-style SUV has strong engines and seating for five. It’s a sleeker version of the BMW X5 and an alternative to the similarly-styled Mercedes GLE Coupe and Porsche Cayenne Coupe. The X6 has been updated for 2024 but you still get the classic, chunky proportions that you expect from an off-roader, with a rakishly angled roof that echoes the sleek lines of a sports car. As is the trend in recent BMWs, the trademark ‘kidney’ grille is now enormous. It’s also available with illumination, to make it even more, er, eye-catching. Inside the look and feel is very BMW X5, which is a good thing. It has an interesting design but functional button layout and everything feels extremely well put together. It also means you get BMW’s latest twin-screen infotainment system, which looks amazing although some functions are harder to use than before the latest update. There are good and bad points to the X6’s space and practicality. Okay, so you’ll seat four adults just fine inside, but the X6 loses some rear headroom in the name of style compared with the X5, plus its middle seat is quite uncomfortable. The boot is smaller than an X5’s (and the Mercedes’ or Porsche’s) and a more awkward shape thanks to its sloping roofline. You’re paying a premium over the X5 for this, remember.

This one has a light-up grille, which I’ll leave you to make your mind up on… Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer There’s a choice of petrol and diesel engines, but the highlight of the range is the performance-focused M60i. This twin-turbo V8 petrol has 530hp and a 0-62mph time of 4.3 seconds. The X6M Competition gives you more power (625hp) for a 0-62mph time of 3.9 seconds. That’s staggering pace for a car of this size and weight, but it is even more expensive to run than the M60i and requires more compromise to comfort. Even the entry-level engines are extremely strong, and given the diesel is the cheapest and most fuel-efficient of the range it makes the most sense. Whichever engine you choose, the X6 feels bulky but comfortable in town and more agile than it has any right to be on a country road given its size. On the motorway, it’s supremely comfy and quiet with the latest driver assistance tech available. The BMW X6 is a mixed bag, then. It’s superb to drive, has a lovely cabin and an eye-candy infotainment system.

The Audi Q8 and Mercedes GLE Coupé for example both owe their existence to it, as do the Porsche Cayenne Coupé and Range Rover Velar.Just how good is the latest BMW X6 though, and how does it compare with the best coupé SUVs?

      "[Ollama] Processing textbmw, x7, Is the BMW X7 a good car? Let’s address the elephant in the room – oh, and this elephant also has a set of comedy gnashers on. Yes, the way the BMW X7 looks will not be to everybody’s taste, but if you like your large luxurious SUVs to be imposing, it doesn’t get much more so than the X7’s whopping great grille filling somebody’s rearview mirror. In fact, the BMW X7 is arguably more imposing than the upmarket SUVs it competes with, the Land Rover Discovery, Audi Q7 and Mercedes GLS. Even a full-fat Range Rover. Think of it as American sports announcer Michael Buffer at a headteacher’s conference. Watch: BMW X7 v Range Rover Inside, things are more restrained, but suitably high quality. You’ll find plenty of piano black, leather and metal surfaces, while adding a (pricey) full merino leather option brings leather lower down and a two-tone shade. Ultimately, you’ll struggle to find any scratchy plastics here and the X7 gives all its alternatives a run for their money inside. The dash is dominated by the curved twin-screen display that incorporates BMW’s latest iDrive infotainment system. It’s stunning to look at, but not quite as easy to use as the previous generation. There are a few functions that are now buried in menus rather than easily accessible with a single button press. It still has a rotary controller with menu shortcut buttons between the front seats, and you can choose to use that, the touchscreen or use voice commands. The second screen behind the steering wheel takes the place of conventional instruments. It’s clear, crisp and configurable, so you can have the information displayed that you want, including things like speed, fuel consumption, navigation info and your radio or media selection. Bluetooth, DAB radio and Apple CarPlay smartphone mirroring is all included, although not Android Auto. All-in-all, it’s better than anything from Audi or Land Rover, although the digital dash and infotainment in the Mercedes GLS is even better. The BMW X7 is a proper seven-seater as standard, which is to say, two adults will be able to sit in comfort in its rearmost seats on a long journey. A BMW X5’s optional third row is much tighter, for example. For not much extra you can swap the X7’s middle row from a three-seat bench to two more luxurious pews. If you can live with six seats rather than seven, it's worth considering Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The X7’s front two rows are even more spacious and the driver is treated to a wide range of electric seat and wheel adjustment. In fact, the middle row can be adjusted and folded electrically, while the third row folds into the boot floor electrically too. Handy buttons in the boot allow you to fold the rear two rows all at the same time for ease. Even with all seven seats up, the X7 still offers 320 litres of boot space, which is about the same as a VW Polo. Fold the rearmost seats down and that grows to a huge 750 litres – that’ll handle pretty much anything a family can throw at it. And you get a fancy split tailgate. You have a choice between one diesel and two petrol engines when buying a BMW X7. The pick of the bunch is the X7 xDrive40d diesel because, with 352hp and an official fuel economy of 32.8-36.2mpg, it has all the power you’ll need, but will keep the bills sensible. The 530hp M60i petrol is much quicker, but also much more expensive in every way, while the 381hp 40i petrol is strong and smooth, but thirstier than the diesel. The BMW X7 is vast, so driving and parking it in town can be a little daunting. Still, it comes with front and rear sensors, multiple cameras for a 3D view of the car and a system that’ll park and even reverse for you. So, no excuses then. Out of town and on meandering country roads the X7 is one of the tidiest SUVs of its type to drive despite its size, but you’ll probably be more interested in just how comfortable its air suspension is over bumps and how quiet it is at a cruise on the motorway. There’s very little wind and road noise at all, and adding BMW’s Driving Assistant Professional optional package brings a system that will accelerate, brake and keep you in your lane for an even more relaxing drive. So, make peace with its looks, don’t get carried away with BMW’s options list and the X7 is a fine luxury seven-seat SUV. Remember, though, that it’s more expensive to buy than a Discovery or Q7, and that if you don’t need seven roomy seats, BMW’s cheaper X5 makes much more sense.

      "[Ollama] Processing textbyd, atto-3, Is the BYD Atto 3 a good car? Another day and another family-oriented electric SUV to bring you. This is the BYD Atto 3, fresh from China, and aiming to find a place on your shortlist if you’re looking at cars like the Peugeot e-2008, MG ZS EV or Kia Niro EV. Like discovering after a few years working together that you went to school with your colleague on the desk across from you, the BYD Atto 3 may be more familiar than you realise. BYD has been manufacturing everything from smartphone components to electric buses since its inception in 1995, and recently has been selling cars in its home market. Now, it wants a slice of the UK pie. At first glance though, it’s not doing too much to stand out. Though its design is inoffensive (‘Build Your Dreams’ badging aside), there’s little about the car that’ll turn your head away from the plethora of choices you have in this segment. Fortunately, the same can’t be said for the eccentric interior. Be it the muscle membrane-like trim inserts, eye-catching vegan leather colour combination or the (functional) guitar strings across the door bins, there’s no accusing the Atto 3 of lacking character inside. BYD Atto 3: electric range, battery and charging data Range: 261 milesEfficiency: 4.0 miles per kWhBattery size: 60kWhMax charge speed: 150kWCharge time AC: 9hrs 42mins, 0-100%, 7kWCharge time DC: 44mins, 10-80%, 150kWCharge port location: Right frontPower outputs: 204hp Better still, build quality is impressive, as you’ll be hard-pressed to find cheap-feeling materials (unless you look way under the dashboard) – a rarity nowadays on more affordable cars. A 12.8-inch infotainment system comes as standard, with a 15.6-inch screen fitted to top-spec Design models. There’s a bit of a party trick to it too, as it’s able to rotate from landscape to portrait at the press of a button. Amusing for a brief moment, though you’ll likely find a preference quickly and leave it untouched. The software on the system itself is pretty intuitive – it’s essentially just an Android tablet. There are some teething issues to solve, though. You do get Apple CarPlay, but there's no Android Auto yet – said to be coming as a no-cost update sometime in the future – and the ‘Hey BYD’ voice assistant adapting to some of the UK’s more regional accents would be welcome. Legroom in the rear of the BYD Atto 3 is decent, though you may be left wanting more headroom. Kids in car seats will be fine, but it’s something to consider if you’re ferrying teenagers or adults around often. It’s a similar story for boot space, too; 440 litres of storage isn’t woeful, but it’s beaten by the Kia Niro EV and MG ZS EV, although it is marginally better than the similarly-sized Peugeot e-2008. The BYD Atto 3 has a quirky interior design – it's smart, but the guitar strings on the doors are just odd Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer All versions of the BYD Atto 3 are powered by a single electric motor, drawing power from a 60.5kWh battery. Official testing has its range at 260 miles, though a cold March day of driving the car in mixed conditions returned 3.3mi/kWh, equating to less than 200 miles of real-world range. If you’re planning to use your Atto 3 as an urban runaround, you’ll be happy to know it’s pleasant to use around town. Visibility is good all-round, and a standard-fit 360-degree camera is a nice addition for parking. Supple suspension results in a comfy ride over bumps in the road, too. That translates nicely out on the motorway as well, though prepare yourself for a lot of wind noise at higher speeds. On a back road, the BYD Atto 3 will wobble around a bit and doesn’t offer much in the way of excitement, but that’s hardly a dealbreaker for cars like this. For a first foray into the UK market, the BYD Atto 3 is a respectable effort. It offers the value and quality to seriously consider compared with the established names, though it lacks some of the polish you find from more familiar brands and that lack of space may prove a sticking point. If you like the look of this good value electric SUV you can check out the latest BYD Atto 3 deals through carwow. You can also look for a great deal on used cars and even sell your car online through carwow, too. WhatCar: What Car? says...The BYD Atto 3 is from a brand you might not be familiar with but that worldwide sells more electric cars than anyone else.In fact, last year BYD sold a colossal 1.57 million electric cars – more than Hyundai, Volkswagen and, at times, even Tesla.

      "[Ollama] Processing textbyd, dolphin, Is the BYD Dolphin a good car? The BYD Dolphin is a mid-sized electric car bringing good levels of equipment and decent practicality, as well as a low starting price – all attributes that make it highly attractive if you're in the market for an EV and you don't want an SUV. Chinese brand BYD launched in the UK with the Atto 3 SUV, and its second model, also all-electric, is the Dolphin. Think of it as a pocket telescope - not impressive in size, but its compact dimensions belie its abilities to show users more than they bargained for. For example, the entry car’s price undercuts potential alternatives such as the MG 4, and significantly undercuts the likes of the Cupra Born, VW ID3 and Smart #1, as well as the smaller Renault Zoe and Peugeot e-208. But equipment levels impress, with kit including electrically adjustable vegan leather seats, a 360-degree surround camera and 12.8-inch rotatable screen all standard on even the entry car. But only the cars over £30,000 get the longer-range battery. And yep, rotatable. At the touch of a button, as long as you’re not using the landscape-only Apple CarPlay/Android Auto, the big infotainment screen will switch from landscape to portrait or back again. Most people will pick a layout and stick with it, but a neat party trick nonetheless. BYD Dolphin: electric range, battery and charging data Range: 196-265 milesEfficiency: 3.9-4.1mi/kWhBattery size: 45kWh / 60kWhMax charge speed: 150kWCharge time AC: 5hrs, 0-100%, 11kW / 6hrs 12mins, 0-100%, 11kWCharge time DC: 40mins, 10-80%, 150kWCharge port location: Right side frontPower outputs: 95hp / 177hp / 204hp The Dolphin comes in four different trim levels, only two of which offer the same battery, power, range and charging stats. At the bottom is the Active which has 95hp and a 211-mile range, while the top-spec Design has 204hp and 265 miles of range. We’ll go into more detail on the different options later on, and the two lower-price cars aren't available until a couple of months after launch. Once past the slightly odd name, the Dolphin has a subtly inoffensive style to it; nothing likely to court car park controversy, but it’s neat enough. On the inside, there is plenty to catch the eye, from the rounded set of switches below the screen that also house the gear selector, to the sweeping air vent surrounds that form part of a dynamic line across the dashboard. Rear seat space is surprisingly good for a car that doesn’t have a big footprint, with taller adults easily able to get comfortable one behind the other. That’s helped by the flat floor – a result of clever battery packaging – and the fact that you can get your feet just about under the front seats. Three rear passengers will be a squeeze though, which isn’t a big surprise in a fairly compact hatchback. Be aware that the bigger battery is only available with the more expensive Dolphin models - the more affordable ones are comparatively down on range Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Boot space is reasonable, and there’s a handy removable rubber mat to keep wet dogs or muddy boots off the carpeted moveable boot floor. It’s a deep space when set in the lower position, and offers a little more room that a Smart #1, Renault Zoe or MG 4, although not quite as much as a Volkswagen ID3 or Cupra Born. To drive, the most powerful of the three power options is a little too powerful for the tyres, especially in the wet where they have a tendency to easily spin the wheels. BYD has acknowledged they’re not perfect, and will be changing the tyres it fits to the Dolphin for cars built from November 2023.

      "[Ollama] Processing textbyd, dolphin, Is the BYD Dolphin a good car? The BYD Dolphin is a mid-sized electric car bringing good levels of equipment and decent practicality, as well as a low starting price – all attributes that make it highly attractive if you're in the market for an EV and you don't want an SUV. Chinese brand BYD launched in the UK with the Atto 3 SUV, and its second model, also all-electric, is the Dolphin. Think of it as a pocket telescope - not impressive in size, but its compact dimensions belie its abilities to show users more than they bargained for. For example, the entry car’s price undercuts potential alternatives such as the MG 4, and significantly undercuts the likes of the Cupra Born, VW ID3 and Smart #1, as well as the smaller Renault Zoe and Peugeot e-208. But equipment levels impress, with kit including electrically adjustable vegan leather seats, a 360-degree surround camera and 12.8-inch rotatable screen all standard on even the entry car. But only the cars over £30,000 get the longer-range battery. And yep, rotatable. At the touch of a button, as long as you’re not using the landscape-only Apple CarPlay/Android Auto, the big infotainment screen will switch from landscape to portrait or back again. Most people will pick a layout and stick with it, but a neat party trick nonetheless. BYD Dolphin: electric range, battery and charging data Range: 196-265 milesEfficiency: 3.9-4.1mi/kWhBattery size: 45kWh / 60kWhMax charge speed: 150kWCharge time AC: 5hrs, 0-100%, 11kW / 6hrs 12mins, 0-100%, 11kWCharge time DC: 40mins, 10-80%, 150kWCharge port location: Right side frontPower outputs: 95hp / 177hp / 204hp The Dolphin comes in four different trim levels, only two of which offer the same battery, power, range and charging stats. At the bottom is the Active which has 95hp and a 211-mile range, while the top-spec Design has 204hp and 265 miles of range. We’ll go into more detail on the different options later on, and the two lower-price cars aren't available until a couple of months after launch. Once past the slightly odd name, the Dolphin has a subtly inoffensive style to it; nothing likely to court car park controversy, but it’s neat enough. On the inside, there is plenty to catch the eye, from the rounded set of switches below the screen that also house the gear selector, to the sweeping air vent surrounds that form part of a dynamic line across the dashboard. Rear seat space is surprisingly good for a car that doesn’t have a big footprint, with taller adults easily able to get comfortable one behind the other. That’s helped by the flat floor – a result of clever battery packaging – and the fact that you can get your feet just about under the front seats. Three rear passengers will be a squeeze though, which isn’t a big surprise in a fairly compact hatchback. Be aware that the bigger battery is only available with the more expensive Dolphin models - the more affordable ones are comparatively down on range Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Boot space is reasonable, and there’s a handy removable rubber mat to keep wet dogs or muddy boots off the carpeted moveable boot floor. It’s a deep space when set in the lower position, and offers a little more room that a Smart #1, Renault Zoe or MG 4, although not quite as much as a Volkswagen ID3 or Cupra Born. To drive, the most powerful of the three power options is a little too powerful for the tyres, especially in the wet where they have a tendency to easily spin the wheels. BYD has acknowledged they’re not perfect, and will be changing the tyres it fits to the Dolphin for cars built from November 2023. Otherwise it’s a pleasant and relaxed experience, although the car doesn’t always smooth itself over urban bumps. But it’s grown-up enough to settle in fine on longer runs, and the light steering is welcome for low-speed manoeuvring, although at higher speeds the standard setting is too light for engaging or spirited driving.

      "[Ollama] Processing textbyd, seal, Is the BYD Seal a good car? The BYD Seal is a bit like the kid who joins the school halfway through Year 11 and yet finishes the year as rugby captain, prefect and top of the exam tables. You see, while BYD has only been selling cars in the UK since summer 2023, the Seal is an electric saloon car that displays maturity and ability that you’d expect from a highly established European manufacturer. In fact, in many ways it’s actually an improvement on the Tesla Model 3 and Hyundai Ioniq 6 which constitute its two closest alternatives. Other electric cars you might consider are the Polestar 2 and BMW i4. While BYD may have launched the Sealion 7 and Seal U in the years since, the Seal is still a better car than either. Ignore the slightly odd naming convention for a while, though, and focus for a second on the styling - which is great. The Seal is a similar shape to the Tesla Model 3, being a saloon car with a dropped snout and rounded roofline - but it has more intricate detailing around the headlights and a neat lightbar at the rear. It’s a bit less anonymous than the Tesla without being too glam. On the inside, though, it’s like BYD’s stylists took one look at Tesla’s minimalist approach and simply said ‘no, thank you’. The dashboard is very distinctive as a result, with air vents that seamlessly mould into full-width panels running across the cabin. There are posh quilted seats and a panel of switchgear in the centre. It all feels quite upmarket, if unconventional. BYD Seal: electric range, battery and charging data Range: 323-354 milesEfficiency: 3.4-3.7mi/kWhBattery size: 83kWh Max charge speed: 150kWCharge time DC: 37mins, 10-80%, 150kWCharge port location: Right side rearPower outputs: 313hp / 530hp Even more unconventional is the infotainment screen, which is a huge 15.6-inches across. BYD’s party piece is that the screen physically rotates from portrait to landscape at the touch of a button. The company says this is because things like the sat-nav are better in portrait mode, but as the standard-fit Apple CarPlay and Android Auto only works in landscape you’ll probably leave the rotating trick as a once-in-a-blue-moon showoff rather than a regular feature. The interface isn’t quite as good as you get in a Model 3 or Ioniq 6, either. The BYD Seal’s screen is bright, clear and responsive, but common functions are buried just a few menus too deep with buttons that are too hard to hit on the move. Drivers and front passengers of all sizes will be able to get comfy up front in those squashy, quilted leather seats, and there’s good stowage for smaller items too. The back seats are a bit more of a squeeze, with decent legroom but headroom that’s limited by the huge panoramic glass roof. There’s a lot to like about the Seal, but it’s a shame so many functions go through the touchscreen that’s too hard to use while driving Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Boot space of 402 litres matches the Ioniq 6 but trails the Model 3. There is a handy front boot for storing charge cables, though. Just note that, as a saloon car, the Seal isn’t as practical for large items as a Polestar 2. To drive, the Seal is deeply impressive. Even the standard rear-wheel drive model is quick, but performance from the all-wheel drive, 530hp Excellence version is mind-bending and, unlike a Tesla, totally repeatable. Responsive and accurate steering, plus suspension that strikes a great balance between comfort and cornering, means it’s even a good amount of fun on a twisty road. Competitive range figures of 323 - 354 miles are the icing on the cake, though it’s a shame there’s no super-long range version to challenge the best Tesla Model 3. Still, the BYD Seal is a car that should definitely be on your shortlist. Interested? Check out our best BYD Seal deals here, or get a great price on a BYD Seal lease.

      "[Ollama] Processing textbyd, seal-u, Is the BYD Seal U a good car? It’s not immediately obvious what sort of car the BYD Seal U is from the name alone - it sounds like it should be related to the all-electric BYD Seal saloon. However, it’s instead a plug-in hybrid family-sized SUV which majors on value - coming in comfortably cheaper than many much smaller hatchbacks and SUVs. It’s also quite a frustrating car, as it doesn’t do things by halves. In some aspects it’s good - very good, arguably near the top of its class. In others, however, it’s firmly near the bottom, making it difficult to recommend. It’s like buying products from Temu or Aliexpress - they can be very good or very bad, but rarely are they just average. The Seal U is a similar size to plug-in hybrid SUVs such as the Hyundai Tucson, Ford Kuga and Volkswagen Tiguan, but it’s closer in price to cars such as the Kia Niro or Jeep Renegade, both of which are a lot smaller. The closest alternative is the MG HS, which comes in at a similar size and a similar price for its plug-in hybrid variant. The BYD Seal U starts on the back foot because of its design. Whereas BYD’s other cars are at least distinctive if not particularly pretty, the Seal U looks like every other SUV was popped into a blender. It’s so anonymous that it would make the perfect getaway car, but the result is that you don’t feel particularly proud or excited to be climbing aboard. At least you’ll have plenty of room inside. Space in the front and rear seats is excellent, with space for a six-foot passenger to stretch out behind a driver of a similar size. The boot isn’t quite so impressive, at 425 litres in capacity - most alternatives offer more room. It’s still a useful space, though, as it’s deep and wide - just not very tall. The BYD Seal U really isn’t good to drive, but it’s so affordable and decently practical it’s difficult to complain too much Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Those sat up front enjoy loads of tech as standard, and a cabin design that’s rather more distinctive than the exterior styling. You get BYD’s trademark rotating touchscreen infotainment system - 15.6-inches across, it’s huge, clear and responsive, even if the interface doesn’t always make the most sense. Other luxurious features include things like full-cabin air purification, which senses when there are lots of pollutants outside (or even inside) the vehicle and can filter them out. It’s driving the Seal U which highlights its Marmite nature more than anything else. The hybrid powertrain is truly excellent, but the rest of the driving experience is very poor. The Seal U runs on its electric motors most of the time, with the petrol engine acting mostly as a generator and only kicking in fully if you put your foot all the way down. That means progress is smooth, if not hugely rapid, and makes the Seal U fantastic for driving around town. Good range on a charge and a generally quiet cabin free of too much wind and road noise further this aspect. But the Seal U’s suspension is so soft that it wallows over bumps like a ship in rough seas, and the steering is so light that it feels as if you’re driving a remote controlled-car. This is especially a shame given that the Seal saloon with which the Seal U (sort of) shares a name is really good to drive.

WhatCar: What Car? says...Seals and petrol are not a great combination in the natural world, but when it comes to cars it can work – as the BYD Seal U shows.Let’s explain. While the BYD Seal is an electric saloon, the Seal U DM-i is a family SUV available exclusively as a petrol plug-in hybrid in the UK. China and some European countries will get a fully electric Seal U but it won't be available with right-hand drive.It’s the first of many PHEVs that BYD is planning to sell here and it looks like the Chinese car maker wants to make a statement.BYD Seal U video reviewIndeed, its electric-only range looks good on paper, its pricing is competitive and its standard equipment list is long. Even entry-level cars get ventilated seats, for example.So how does the BYD Seal U fare in practice against other rival family SUVs, including the Hyundai Tucson and Kia Sportage – not to mention our current favourite PHEV, the MG HS PHEV? Read on to find out…OverviewThe BYD Seal U DM-i has a well-equipped interior, smooth plug-in hybrid system and competitive pricing going for it. Plus, its electric-only range is long, especially if you opt for the Comfort variant. On the other hand, the slushy driving experience leaves clear room for improvement.

      "[Ollama] Processing textbyd, sealion-7, Is the BYD Sealion 7 a good car? The BYD Sealion 7 is a roomy electric SUV with sporty looks, impressive specs and a very reasonable price tag - on paper, a brilliant alternative to electric vehicles such as the Tesla Model Y, Kia EV6 or Peugeot E-3008. BYD’s models can be a bit hit and miss, though. The Seal and Dolphin are really good electric cars, but the Seal U plug-in hybrid SUV is rather disappointing. The Sealion 7 is a mixed bag - it's not as outwardly brilliant as the Seal, but it's far better than the Seal U and a credible alternative to the aforementioned Tesla. The Sealion 7 gets off to a reasonable start because while it’s not exactly handsome, it’s a bit less anonymous than the Seal U. BYD’s signature headlight design features C-shape LEDs, sat above a chunky bumper design with big air intakes. A sleek, sloping roofline trails rearward to a tailgate spoiler and a full-width rear lightbar. Inside, things are a bit less lukewarm - it’s genuinely nice inside, with posh-feeling materials swaddling every surface and an interesting dashboard design covered in flowing lines. There’s a huge 15.6-inch infotainment screen with BYD’s trademark rotating party trick - this is cool the first few times, but is likely to be relegated to gimmick status after you’ve shown your mates. BYD Sealion 7: electric range, battery and charging data Range: 283-312 milesBattery size: 82.5kWh / 91.3kWhMax charge speed: 150kW / 230kWCharge time DC: 32mins, 10-80%, 150kW / 24mins, 10-80%, 230kWCharge port location: Right side rearPower outputs: 313hp / 530hp There are some materials that feel a little bit cheap considering that the Sealion 7 isn’t a budget machine, but overall it feels quite premium - even if it’s lacking the wow factor of a Peugeot E-3008. No such caveats when it comes to the space on offer, though. The front seats are big, squashy and comfortable, and the storage solutions for smaller items are useful - but the back seats are huge, so rear passengers will be able to stretch out as much as they’d like. You won’t have any issues fitting lanky teens or bulky child seats back here, though the middle seat backrest is quite uncomfortable so it’s certainly better for two people. At 520 litres in capacity, boot space can’t hold a candle to the Tesla Model Y but it’s pretty good compared with most other alternatives. There’s a deep underfloor storage compartment and even a useful ‘frunk’ where you’d find the engine on a combustion-powered car. If you’re looking for lots of space in the cabin, the BYD Sealion 7 could be appealing, but it’s far from best-in-class in most other areas… Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The Sealion 7 offers a choice of two large battery packs, with a claimed range of between 283-312 miles. That sounds good on paper, but during our testing we saw really poor efficiency which would suggest that even the larger battery will only return a figure in the 200s. Not so good. It is powerful, though, and the motors are smooth and silent, so getting up to speed on the motorway is easy. It’s a shame that the rest of the car isn’t quite as refined - there’s a lot of wind noise and tyre roar. Worse still, the Sealion 7’s suspension feels very unsettled. It bounces a lot over bumps, and you can feel the body moving long after you've passed a road imperfection. It’s like being in a rather unstable ship at sea. On top of this, twitchy and hyperactive steering means it’s not even much fun to drive down a twisting B-road, which is a shame. The Sealion 7 is an interesting left-field choice if you value technology and passenger space, but the alternatives all have more enticing driving dynamics and better range, for less cash.

In the same way you wouldn’t wear a miniskirt and heels for climbing Mount Snowdon, and you wouldn’t wear tweeds and brogues to the beach, you wouldn’t buy a 500 for long cross-country schleps. The compact city car is something of a dying breed, but if you’re shopping for a Fiat 500 then you could also consider the Toyota Aygo X, Kia Picanto or the Renault Clio. The little Fiat has all these cars beaten on the style front though, offering a unique splash of retro chic. Things get even funkier inside, where the body-coloured dashboard and optional white steering wheel help lift the ambience nicely. The seats themselves aren’t the comfiest, but there’s plenty of adjustment to help you get a good view out and all the controls are grouped sensibly together so they’re a doddle to use. That said, the Fiat 500’s 7.0-inch touchscreen infotainment system takes a bit of getting used to thanks to the fiddly menus, but you can always use the standard-fit Apple CarPlay or Android Auto instead. Sadly, there isn’t much you can do about the Fiat 500’s cramped seats. Two adults in the front will be fine, but anyone close to six-feet tall will struggle for knee- and headroom in the back, and there isn’t a great deal of space in the Fiat 500’s boot for everyone’s luggage.

Its 1.0-litre mild hybrid petrol engine is best suited to town driving as well, and it’s pretty economical. The great all-round visibility and light steering also help to make light work of tight car parks. Sure, it isn’t the most comfortable small car out there and it’s a bit noisy at speed, but it’ll tackle a twisty country road without much body lean and all models come with cruise control to help make the occasional motorway journey a bit more bearable.

      "[Ollama] Processing textfiat, 500-electric, Is the Fiat 500e a good car? This is the Fiat 500e, a city car with lovable retro-chic looks and an all-electric motor and battery – it's a bit like Greta Thunberg, because it's small and eco friendly. The 500e is a bit bigger and heavier than the petrol 500 that's also still on sale, but it still has diddy dimensions. If you're looking for a small EV there aren't many to choose from – but the Vauxhall Corsa Electric, BYD Dolphin and Peugeot e-208 are all great choices. Rather than add a bunch of fiddly details to the outside, Fiat’s gone back to basics and made the 500 look smoother, more rounded and even more minimalist than before. It’s like your grandad suddenly ditching the dyed comb-over and shaving his head instead. Smoother, simpler, cooler. For starters, the old car’s headlights have been ditched in favour of two semi-circular lamps with curved daytime-running lights that shine out through the bonnet. The flush door handles and hidden indicators are pretty much the only difference you’ll spot from the side, and the lack of an exhaust pipe is a dead giveaway that you’re looking at the new car from behind. OK, so the new Fiat 500e looks pretty similar to the old car on the outside, but it’s a totally different story inside. There’s a brand-new 7.0-inch digital dial display instead of traditional dials, and you get a big 10.25-inch touchscreen on the dashboard with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone mirroring. The physical controls for the heating and air conditioning are grouped together under the central touchscreen and there’s a storage tray where you’d find a gear lever in a petrol- or diesel-powered car. Space in the front is good for two adults and there are decent storage options, but the back seats cater for two only, and they’ll have to be quite small people at that. Fitting a child seat is pretty much impossible, too, while the 500’s boot is good for the weekly shop, but not much else. It is a city car, after all. With compact dimensions and an all-electric powertrain, the Fiat 500e is a superb city car option, even if the range won't take you too far out of it Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The Fiat 500e comes with two battery options – one that offers a 115-mile range and another with a 199-mile range, which isn't great when each of the other alternatives can go comfortably more than 200 miles in official tests. You can recharge your 500 using a three-pin socket, but that’ll take all night – literally. You’ll be better off getting a wallbox to take advantage of AC charging up to 11kW (or 7.4kW if that's the maximum you can get at your house), which will charge the battery in under three hours. The quickest way to charge is using a public fast charger, with the Fiat 500 capable of taking up to 85kW. At these speeds it can go from empty to 80% charged in 35 minutes, and add a useful 30 miles of charge in just five minutes. The Fiat 500 comes with either a 95hp motor that can hustle it from 0-62mph in 9.5 seconds, or a 118hp electric motor with enough poke to accelerate it from 0-62mph in nine seconds. That doesn’t sound particularly fast but the new 500 will do 0-30mph in three seconds, which is nippy in town and faster than most small city cars. Also handy in town is the new 500’s automatic emergency braking that’ll spot pedestrians and cyclists in your path and automatically apply the brakes if it thinks you’re about to hit them. That’s in addition to adaptive cruise control that’ll accelerate and brake for you on motorways to keep you a safe distance from the car ahead. There are three driving modes, Normal, Range and Sherpa. Range mode uses the motor to recharge the batteries when you brake to help boost the Fiat 500’s range, while Normal model tones down this ‘regenerative braking’ effect. The Sherpa function limits the 500’s top speed to 50mph (down from 93mph) and turns off the air conditioning. These extreme measures will be useful in an emergency when you really need to eke out every last mile to reach a charging point. So, the Fiat 500 is now an electric city car, but we think you’ll agree it’s a good one, provided you don’t need lots of space or expect the last word in interior quality. If you just love the looks, head to our Fiat 500e deals page. If you'd like a used Fiat 500 then head over to our used 500e deals. You can also check out other used Fiat models, and if you want to change your car altogether, you can sell your car through Carwow with the help of our trusted dealers. WhatCar: What Car? says...If it’s retro charm you’re after, not many new cars come close to the chic Fiat 500e. With looks harking back to the Fifties classic of the same name, this all-electric reimagining of the Fiat 500 (Cinquecento in Italy) turns heads like few other cars in its price bracket.This electric 500 (there's also a petrol hybrid version) is available with an official range of up to 199 miles. Fiat also sells a more affordable version aimed at buyers who want to keep costs down and don't plan to travel too far from home. It has a smaller battery and offers up to 118 miles of range.If you go for the version with the bigger battery, you can choose between a regular hardtop roof or the 500e Cabrio convertible version, which has a retractable canvas roof.Fiat 500e video reviewSo, what are the Fiat 500e’s key rivals? Well, most electric cars are pricier and bigger, but they include the Honda e, the Mini Cooper Electric and the Peugeot e-208. Or, if performance is your thing, there's a glitzier and quicker hot hatch lookalike, called the Abarth 500e., Carwow \\\\ Whatcar...\n",

      "[Ollama] Processing textfiat, 500c, Is the Fiat 500C a good car? Inspired by ‘La Dolce Vita’ of warm days in Tuscany or Rome, the Fiat 500C is a convertible small car that has a sliding soft-top and wonderfully retro styling. With only the Mini Convertible and Toyota Aygo X (when it's fitted with a sliding roof) the only true alternatives, the 500C is part of a rare breed – but it’s not going the way of the dodo just yet, with the 500 Electric Convertible taking up the zero-emission mantle. Its style is classic Fiat, with plenty of chrome trim around the main badge and lights matching the throwback looks. The short overhangs, which make it great in town, are matched with more chrome around the back, which has rectangular lights and shows the full extent of the sliding roof. Inside, most of the dashboard features a body-coloured panel to match the outside. That hosts the 7.0-inch touchscreen, the climate controls and a high-mounted gear lever. The steering wheel sits in front of the speedometer, which has the rev counter inside it as well as a small driver information display, which isn’t easy to navigate. Top versions get a 7.0-inch screen behind the wheel, although that isn’t the simplest to use either. You won’t find a lot of cabin space in the 500C. Yes, the driver can get comfortable fairly easily, but if you’re tall you won’t find masses of headroom available. Trying to squeeze adults into the back is very tricky, as you have to fold the front seat forward, then clamber into a space where you’ll find little room. It’s worth splashing the cash and getting the Fiat 500C Top if you want this cute and stylish supermini – even if it’s not the best to live with Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The boot isn’t particularly large either. At 185 litres, it seriously lags behind the boot in the Mini Convertible and Toyota Aygo X, while multiple other small cars top that if you’re not desperate for the sliding roof. Folding the back seats down does open more space, but the boot opening itself is too narrow to fit larger items in. You only get one engine choice with the 500C – a 70hp 1.0-litre three-cylinder petrol engine with a small generator and battery applied to help with fuel economy. That comes with a six-speed manual transmission. The sprint from 0-60mph is more of a jog, taking 13.8 seconds. In town, the keenly revving engine helps you get up to urban speeds quickly enough, while the light steering can be made even lighter by pressing a button on the centre console to make the Fiat more manoeuvrable. The 500C is comfortable enough over bumps and you get a good view around you, but the rear view can be hindered with the roof rolled down. That tiny engine does start to run out of puff when you’re on the motorway though. As it takes so long to get up to speed, you have to make the most out of every gear by revving it close to the red line. It is also quite noisy at higher speeds, with wind and road noise glaringly obvious. If you’re in an Abarth 695C – a tricked-out Fiat 500 – twisty roads are a lot of fun. Not so much in the Fiat 500C. You feel like you might topple over if you take a corner too quickly, and the steering does not give you a great sense of how much grip your front tyres have. While the Fiat 500C offers a lot for those wanting to enjoy sunnier weather when driving around town, there are sacrifices that need to be made –. it’s not that practical for its size and isn’t refined when you need to go on a longer journey, with a Mini Convertible or Toyota Aygo X being more accomplished overall.

The Fiat 500X isn’t a bad choice if you’re looking for a small, stylish SUV and find yourself put off by the bland looks of the SEAT Arona or the stodgy drive offered by the Citroen C3 Aircross. The 500X was launched in 2014 and – to help it keep pace with the SEAT and Citroen – got a facelift in 2018. Changes included an updated interior, a new infotainment system, extra safety kit and a couple of new petrol engines. The diesels from the old model have been dropped. In terms of exterior styling, only the lights have changed – you now get new daytime running lights and rear LEDs – so you’ll struggle to tell the difference between the old car and this 2018 model. You can also choose from two exterior (rather optimistically coined) ‘body styles’ – Urban Look, which has conventional body coloured bumpers or Cross Look which has chunkier bumpers with mock skid plates. The interior gets the same retro look as the outside, the large swathe of body-coloured plastic that runs across the dashboard gives the 500X a playful feel that’s missing from the dingy SEAT Arona. But, while the 2018 500X gets a new instrument binnacle and a new steering wheel, its interior plastics look cheap in places, particularly in the back, and its switches and buttons are a little flimsy. The 500X looks like a cutesy Fiat 500 that's been blown up like a balloon and given a pair of extra doors Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The infotainment system has also been updated but doesn’t have the clear graphics or ease of use you get in the SEAT’s system. You do, however, get Apple CarPlay and Android Auto as standard in the Fiat, so it is easy to use your smartphone’s apps on the car’s 7.0-inch screen. Up front, there’s plenty of space to get comfy even if you’re tall and someone of a similar size should be able to squeeze behind you, too. The Fiat has a slightly smaller boot than its aforementioned alternatives, but it is easy to load and has space for a couple of large suitcases. Filled to the brim with people and stuff, the 500X’s otherwise nippy 120hp petrol engine isn’t going to feel quick, but it’s still the engine to go for because the quicker 150hp 1.3-litre model’s standard automatic gearbox is frustratingly slow to change which blunts acceleration. It’s a shame the more powerful engine is spoiled because there’s not much wrong with the way the 500X drives. In town, you can zip in and out of gaps in traffic, while at faster speeds there’s not too much body lean to worry about and the Fiat’s weighty steering makes it easy to place in bends. On the motorway, the suspension smooths out bumps better than it does at slower speeds, although the cabin does suffer from a fair amount of wind noise.
