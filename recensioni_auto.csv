mg,general,"Is the MG3 a good car? The MG3 used to be a bit of a joke - the old one was the lowest-ranked car on Carwow - but the new model aims to change all that. Now, instead of being antiquated, it’s right up there with the best small cars for performance, efficiency and equipment. Like an air fryer from the middle of Lidl, the MG3’s feature set is as good as any of its alternatives and it’s not immediately clear where the money’s been saved to bring it in at such a low price. Now that it’s a full self-charging hybrid car, the MG3 no longer targets the very cheapest on the market like the Dacia Sandero or Citroen C3 Origin. Instead, it’s more like a cut-price alternative to the Renault Clio E-Tech or Toyota Yaris - a halfway house for people who want the most efficient small car possible, but either don’t want or can’t have a fully electric model. The MG3 won’t win awards for its practicality - it’s not cramped, but it’s no better than average in this regard with a boot that’s about halfway between the Yaris and the Clio in capacity. Rear seat space is moderate, too, though annoyingly the rear seats don’t split when they fold which does limit overall versatility. The front of the cabin looks great, and very modern - in stark contrast to the car it replaces. Poke around and you can find a few places where MG’s saved money - there’s a sliding cover for one of the storage compartments that feels comically flimsy, and the top of the dash and the door cards are made of hard plastic - but the Clio and the Yaris have areas that feel equally cheap. The new MG3 is a transformation from the old model, and instantly becomes one of the best small cars you can buy Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer More importantly, MG’s given the 3 its best touchscreen infotainment system yet, and it’s loaded with equipment - climate control, a digital dashboard, sat-nav and a full suite of assisted driving features are standard on every model. The MG’s hybrid system is brand-new, and puts out an impressive 191hp - versus 140hp for the Clio and up to 130hp for the Yaris. That means it’s easily got any of them beat in a drag race, and makes mincemeat of overtakes or motorway sliproads. It’s not quite as efficient as the alternatives, but you might decide that the additional performance makes the small drop in mpg worthwhile. The real surprise is what happens when you reach a twisty road. The old MG3 was always shockingly good fun in the corners, but unexpectedly MG has managed to repeat the trick. The new MG3 handles brilliantly for a small car, and that makes it one of the most enjoyable small cars to drive. Sound interesting?

mg,general,"Is the MG ZS a good car? The previous-generation MG ZS was a small SUV that you’d buy because it was cheap - and then spend the rest of your time apologising for it. It was unattractive, thirsty, poor to drive and had a really cheap-feeling interior. However, the second-generation model has had a true Cinderella-style glow-up, and should push the old car right to the back of everybody’s minds - it’s a huge improvement in every way. Based on the same mechanical underpinnings as the excellent MG3 hatchback, the new ZS gets an up-to-date hybrid engine, techy interior and a smart - if not stunning - new look. It’s like trading in your old Nokia for a new smartphone. Probably not the latest Apple iPhone, as MG is still firmly a budget brand - more like one of those off-brand Android phones that gives you lots and lots of bang for your buck. As a small hybrid SUV, there are alternatives to the MG ZS coming from every corner. Some of the best include the Renault Captur, the Hyundai Kona Hybrid, the Peugeot 2008 or the Carwow award-winning Toyota Yaris Cross. MG does things a bit differently to those cars, though. First of all, there’s the way the hybrid system works. It’s far more powerful than any of those alternatives - with 191hp beating out 140hp in the Captur or a measly 115hp in the Yaris Cross. MG’s done this by fitting a more powerful electric motor and a bigger battery, which means that most of the time it drives like an electric car with a petrol generator. However, if you put your foot down both power sources will give their all, making this quite a rapid little SUV. The ZS undercuts almost every alternative on price while offering loads of space and a powerful engine - but you may want to pay a little extra for a more polished ownership experience Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The comparison is also pretty favourable when it comes to interior space. The ZS has enough room for a six-foot adult to sit behind a driver of the same size in comfort, which means it’s also great for child seats or lanky teenagers. The 443-litre boot is also bigger than the hybrid Renault Captur or the Toyota Yaris Cross, and only marginally smaller than the Hyundai Kona hybrid. It’s in the cabin where you notice evidence of MG’s cost-cutting, though - there are plenty of low-rent material choices, and infotainment software that despite being a huge improvement on the old ZS isn’t as easy to use or as intuitive as the best systems out there. You do get loads of equipment, though. The top-spec Trophy model is still inexpensive but comes with climate control, sat-nav, smartphone connectivity, leather upholstery and a full suite of driver assistance tech including the semi-autonomous MG Pilot system. To drive, it’s another huge leap from the old car, which was pretty dire on the road. The ZS isn’t as satisfying to drive as a Renault Captur or Toyota Yaris Cross, despite its superior power output - but it has light controls and good visibility, making it great around town. Only poor refinement on the motorway and quite crashy suspension let the side down. If lots of power and equipment for a low price capture your imagination, check out our best MG ZS deals right here.

mg,general,"Is the MG ZS EV a good car? The MG ZS EV is an electric SUV that goes up against the likes of the Hyundai Kona Electric and Kia Niro EV – both of which are now well-established options at the affordable end of the electric car market. It’s a bit like going for a pair of cheap Bluetooth headphones. It might not be from the obvious choice of brands, but it promises to do a similar job at a lower cost. Since its revival as a mass-production manufacturer, MG’s models haven’t been the most exciting to look at. The new ZS EV is in a similar vein, but this updated version now comes with a blanked-out grille and LED headlights as part of a tweaked front end. There is also a new rear bumper with altered lights. MG has also improved the interior design, with the main addition being a new 10.1-inch infotainment touchscreen that has updated software to make it much smoother than before. A 7.0-inch driver display has also been added that offers efficiency and safety information. But where alternatives may offer slightly more comfort and refinement, you’ll find a lot of scratchy plastics alongside the new carbon fibre-effect upholstery finish on the dashboard and leather trim on the seats. In the back, you have decent legroom behind even the tallest of drivers. But as the batteries are mounted under the floor, your knees end up quite high. Headroom is also not the best, with the panoramic sunroof on Trophy models eating into the space even more. Taller passengers may struggle to get comfortable in the back. With an adjustable boot floor as standard, you get 470 litres. This is on par with the Kia Niro EV's 475 litres, but is 140 litres more than the Hyundai Kona Electric's offering. Folding the seats down creates a 1,100-litre space, but the seats don’t quite fold flat. Although refinement and overall quality aren’t the best, the ZS EV is more than capable of being a practical option Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The ZS EV comes with two battery options. The 51kWh Standard Range and 72kWh Long Range options offer up to 198 and 273 miles respectively. When driving in the real world across multiple conditions and in all three driving modes – Eco, Normal and Sport – you get closer to 240 miles. But leave it in Normal mode and you’ll get nearer to the claimed figure. Around town, the steering feels light and accurate. It also doesn’t allow many bumps into the cabin at slow speeds, with the suspension setup in normal mode helping it out. On the motorway, you’ll notice a lot of tyre noise and, if you go for the top-spec Trophy version, the roof rails do make a slight whistling noise. It feels comfortable on the whole, but the seats don’t have as much cushioning or support as you might like. When applying Sport mode and tackling a country road, the ZS feels pretty stable. It isn’t the most engaging car in the world and it can scrabble for grip in damper conditions – but for most that won’t be much of an issue. With its competitive pricing and practicality, the ZS EV is a model you should consider. It may not be as refined as alternatives, but it can certainly be a useful option if you’re in the market for an efficient SUV.

mg,general,"Is the MG HS a good car? The MG HS has at points been the best-selling car in the UK and it’s easy to see why. It’s a big, practical family SUV with a posh-looking interior, loads of standard equipment and a headline-grabbing plug-in hybrid engine option - but it costs about as much as most small hatchbacks. While the old HS was definitely in the ‘cheap but not very cheerful’ category, the new model actually feels like something you wouldn’t mind driving around - it has redeeming features other than its price tag. It’s a bit like a Harvester - nobody’s ever going to look at it as a high-end option, but if you’re looking to feed the whole family on a budget, it’s tasty enough that you don’t feel punished for your penny-pinching. The HS is a similar size to family SUVs such as the Ford Kuga, Kia Sportage and Nissan Qashqai - but with its low price tag, you might consider it on the same shortlist as much smaller SUVs such as the Volkswagen T-Cross or Ford Puma. Two more direct alternatives are the Citroen C5 Aircross or BYD Seal U - both big SUVs that put affordability first, and have plug-in hybrid engines available. If your main concern is space for the money, the MG HS is a great option. Despite a price tag close to something like a Volkswagen Polo hatchback, it has space in the back for a six-foot adult to stretch out, plus a 507-litre boot that’ll accommodate the whole family’s kit and clobber. Still remarkably cheap but now much more capable - the MG HS is now a car I could recommend for more than just its price tag Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer You also get a dashboard that looks pretty posh, with a dual-screen setup just like you get on a BMW X3. You don’t have to press very far to find out where MG’s saved money, though, and materials and build quality aren’t really up to the standards of more expensive cars. It’s also not the easiest to use, with very few physical switches, an awkward touchscreen interface and not much storage for smaller items. As far as engines go, there’s a choice of two. You can have a bog-standard petrol, available with manual or automatic gearboxes - these are the more affordable options, and though they’re not particularly offensive to drive they are a bit thirsty. The headline-grabber is the HS plug-in hybrid, which can do up to 75 miles on a charge. That figure is up there with the best PHEVs on sale, and it gives you tons of flexibility - it’s enough to do even the longest of commutes without troubling the petrol engine once. It also nudges the HS into the lowest-but-one band for Benefit-in-Kind tax, making it hundreds of pounds a month cheaper than the equivalent Kia Sportage or Ford Kuga for company car drivers. Both of those cars are better to drive, mind you - they steer more sweetly and handle bumps better, as well as being more responsive and reassuring in the corners. The gap is narrower if you’re just cruising round town or on the motorway, though, where the HS is impressively refined and difficult to dislike. If the new MG HS seems like the SUV for you, check out our best MG HS deals on Carwow. You can see our other MG deals here, or search for a used MG for sale here. And remember, Carwow can even help you sell your old car.",,Carwow
mg,general,"Is the MG4 EV a good car? MG pulled an absolute blinder with the MG4, and much like the lovable underdog in a boxing movie it punches well above its weight division. It’s more affordable than alternatives such as the Renault Megane E-Tech and Cupra Born, costing around the same as the smaller Vauxhall Corsa Electric and Fiat 500e. You’d be forgiven for thinking that MG have taken a ‘cheap and cheerful’ approach to engineering the MG4, but that’s far from the truth. So far from it, in fact, that the MG4 received high commendations in the 2024 Carwow Car of the Year Awards’ Outstanding EV and Urban Living categories. Just look at it, a mix of pointy details, sharp creases and funky shapes such as the lower body cladding and split roof spoiler. It’s a refreshing looking thing; it still stands out against newer MGs such as the MG S5 and MG HS as much as it does its alternatives. MG4 EV: electric range, battery and charging data Range: 218-331 milesEfficiency: 3.6-3.8 miles per kWhBattery size: 51kWh / 62kWh / 74kWhMax charge speed: 150kWCharge time AC: 6hrs 12mins, 10-100%, 7kW / 7hrs 30mins, 10-100%, 7kW / 9hrs, 10-100%, 7kWCharge time DC: 39mins, 10-80%, 150kW / 35mins, 10-80%, 150kWCharge port location: Left rearPower outputs: 170hp / 204hp / 245hp It’s a shame the interior isn’t quite as novel, with a dashboard layout that’s so simple it verges on boring, but the material quality, fit and finish and standard kit is better than you might expect for the price. A 10.25-inch infotainment display comes as standard on all trim levels of the MG4, and though it comes with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, MG’s own software is rather basic. It’s frustrating to operate too, especially on the move, with too many menus to navigate. There’s plenty of room in the MG4 though; plenty of adjustability for you to get comfy behind the wheel and enough head and leg room for tall passengers in the rear - though it’s a bit of a squeeze when you’ve got three in the back. The 363-litre boot capacity trails the Volkswagen ID3 for space, and puts it well behind the Megane E-Tech. The MG4 comes with two battery options, offering 218 claimed miles of range in its most basic trim through to 323 miles for the Trophy Extended Range model. The top-rung MG4 XPower, which we’ve reviewed separately, offers a big power hike over the rest of the trim levels, but makes do with a 239-mile range. MG has fully injected its own personality into the MG4 EV, and it leaves you wanting to get to know it a lot more… Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Around town the MG4 is easy to potter about in thanks to its light steering, peppy electric motors and most importantly, its comfortable suspension. It takes potholes, speed bumps and cracked roads in its stride, and the same applies to motorways where the MG4 just soaks up the miles with ease. Yet even with its soft suspension the MG4 is rather fun to drive on a twisty road, feeling agile and grippy with little in the way of body lean. The X-Power is particularly rapid, but it’s different enough that we've reviewed it separately here. For a stonking value for money proposition, have a look at our new MG4 deals as well as our MG4 lease deals. You can also check out used MG4s from our network of trusted dealers as well as other used MGs. When it’s time for a change, you can even sell your current car through Carwow.",,Carwow
mg,general,"Is the MG S5 EV a good car? The MG S5 is the sequel to the MG ZS EV - it’s a compact, all-electric SUV, and like the rest of MG’s range majors on value-for-money - putting it right in the firing line of really excellent electric cars such as the Volvo EX30, Kia EV3 and Skoda Elroq. It’s also the first MG we’ve reviewed that doesn’t really have any caveats - no ‘it’s great for this, but…’ modifiers need to be added. While that does mean it’s not quite as standout as MG’s other cars, like the cheap-as-chips MG 4 or the BIK champion MG HS, it also means that it’s easier to recommend for more people. It’s like a chef who starts their career out with wild and divisive combinations like salmon teacakes with a candyfloss mousse, but matures into making a really solid sea bass with risotto. Like some of the most reliable dishes, the new S5 EV doesn’t exactly shout about its prowess. The styling is the first thing to get past - or the lack of styling, you could say. The S5 EV looks as though MG’s design team started with a normal SUV and then Photoshopped out any of its distinguishing features. While this definitely means it blends into the crowd, you’ll have to be a really magnolia kind of person to be excited by its featureless front end or lower grille ‘inspired’ by the Cyberster sports car. MG S5 EV: electric range, battery and charging data Range: 211 - 298 milesEfficiency: 4.3 - 4.7 mi/kWhBattery size: 49kWh/64kWhMax charge speed: 120kW/139kWCharge time AC: 7hrs / 9hrs 15m @ 7kWCharge time DC: 24min / 28min 10-80%Charge port location: Left rearPower outputs: 170hp / 228hp Things start to look up when you get inside, though. The S5 EV has MG’s best interior to date. Just about everything you touch is covered in soft-touch material, and you really have to look quite hard to find any cheap, nasty plastics - that’s not something you could say about the MG 4, which shares its underpinnings with the S5 EV. Better yet, MG’s listened to feedback from reviewers and journalists, and implemented a few features to make life just that little bit easier. There are physical climate controls underneath the screen so you don’t have to go rootling round in touchscreen menus just to change the temperature, and there’s an easy shortcut to switch off the more annoying driver assistance features too. The MG S5 EV isn't exactly eye-catching, but it offers a really impressive combination of space and equipment for the money Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The S5 EV is great for families as well, as it has bags of rear legroom and a 453-litre boot - nearly matching the roomy Kia EV3. There are two models available - a Standard Range car that can do up to 211 miles on a charge and a Long Range variant which claims up to 298 miles of range. It’s a shame MG has no plans to introduce an Extended Range model, as that could really take the fight to the Kia EV3 which has up to 375 miles of range. So behind the dull looks, the MG S5 EV is really quite a good electric car indeed. If you’re interested, you could check out our best MG S5 EV deals here, or find a great MG S5 leasing offer.

mg,general,"Is the MG4 XPower a good car? This is the MG4 XPower, and it’s a bit like a supermarket's own-brand vindaloo – packing plenty of heat at a value price. It’s a car you’d consider if you’ve been waiting for the dawn of the electric hot hatch, but the higher-power variants of the Cupra Born or Volkswagen ID3 just don’t offer enough punch for you. Not that the looks of the XPower would suggest it’s the exciting version – not a great deal of change has been made over the base MG4. Orange brake callipers and new 18-inch wheels give the game away if you know what you’re looking for, as do a few polished trim pieces, but the bodywork is otherwise untouched. The stealthy vibe may appeal, but there’s a case to be made that MG could and should have done more to shout about the car’s performance. Similarly, there’s very little difference inside compared with the standard MG4. Aside from some Alcantara seat and door inserts, as well as a touch of red stitching, there’s nothing to scream XPower here. Material quality continues to impress for the price, but a dull selection of colours and a basic design does nothing to add to the excitement the car’s power promises. Drag race: Lamborghini Gallardo v MG4 XPower v Nissan GT-R Also retained for the XPower is the 10.25-inch infotainment system, packed with sat nav along with support for Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. A few welcome quality-of-life improvements have been made to the software, as well as a basic ‘Track Mode’ app that gives you real-time access to G-force and acceleration data. As with the base MG4, rear passenger space is impressive, with a decent amount of head and legroom even for taller adults. Boot space is also untouched at 363 litres, which is marginally behind the Volkswagen ID3’s 385 litres. The big changes for the MG4 XPower lie under the skin. As well as more power for the rear motor, a second motor has been added to the front axle too, combining to produce 435hp and 600Nm of torque. The result is 0-60mph in a mind-boggling 3.8 seconds (for context, that’s quicker than a Porsche 911 Carrera 4) and an increased top speed of 124mph. It’s not just the off-the-line performance that’s so impressive either, with a real gut-punching kick from 30-70mph too. To help cope with that extra power, MG has made some mechanical tweaks as well. An electronic locking differential has been added alongside a torque vectoring system, which combine to manage how power is distributed to the wheels through corners. The suspension is the same as the base MG4, though with new tuning for the springs and dampers. MG has made the 'Volkswagen ID3 R' that never was. This is a hauntingly fast EV, but it’s not one to excite you outside of a straight-line sprint Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Though the result is a car that’s certainly capable when you throw it through the bends, it’s not particularly involving. Dull steering makes it difficult to feel how much grip the front wheels have, and even the mechanical upgrades can’t hide the fact this is quite a heavy car. You may outrun a Honda Civic Type R or Hyundai i30 N, but you won’t have as much fun in the twisty stuff. On top of that, because of the suspension tweaks, the MG4 XPower crashes over bumps in the road more so than the regular car, though otherwise remains pretty comfortable around town. At motorway speeds though, you do really notice the wind noise as well as a slight whine from the new front motor. Official range figures from the 64kWh battery dip from 270 miles in the Long Range car to 239 miles for this sporty XPower model. A mixed driving route with the car for this test returned 2.9 miles/kWh, equating to around 185 miles of real-world range. For stomach-churning, sports-car troubling performance at a value price, the MG4 XPower delivers big. That said, traditional hot hatch buyers may struggle to be won over by quite a muted driving experience beyond the numbers. Looking to make this electric hot hatch your next car?

mg,general,"Is the MG GS a good car? The MG GS is a medium-sized family SUV that’s a little larger than the likes of the Nissan Qashqai and Renault Kadjar, yet costs a little less. Unfortunately, some of the MG’s penny-pinching is all too obvious, such as the brittle interior plastics and second-rate infotainment system. From the outside, the MG GS looks more like a jacked-up hatchback than most family SUVs. It sports all the black plastic bumper trims you’d expect of a chunky pseudo-off-roader, but the MG GS’ curvy bumpers, slim brake lights and raked roofline look sportier than the comparatively boxy Kia Sportage and Hyundai Tucson. Unfortunately, the MG GS’ interesting exterior only serves to show how dull and drab its interior is. It’s neatly laid out and all the buttons are grouped together so they’re easy to reach, but almost every surface comes with a hard plastic finish and the optional brushed-metal effect trims don’t feel anywhere near as robust as they look. You can have contrasting inserts fitted to the dashboard and doors, but these do little to spruce up the GS’ interior. Equally middling is the touchscreen infotainment system. It’s easy to read but nowhere near as intuitive as the systems you get in most alternatives. What it loses out in technology, the GS claws back (albeit only slightly) in terms of practicality. There’s just as much room in the front seats as you get in the likes of the Nissan Qashqai and there’s more space for carrying three adults at once in the back. The MG GS might appeal if you’re looking for something practical and likely to stand out, but it isn’t particularly good to drive and doesn’t feel as well built as most other family SUVs. Mat Watson Carwow expert It’s a similar story when you need to load the MG GS’ boot. It’s bigger than the Nissan’s and there’s no load lip which makes it easy to slide in heavy boxes. You can fold the back seats down if you need to carry seriously bulky stuff, such as a bike. It’s a shame you can’t get the MG GS with a diesel engine to help you carry very heavy luggage or tow a trailer, though. Instead, it comes with a 1.5-litre 166hp petrol unit. At least it feels fairly spritely and trundles along at motorway speeds relatively quietly – if not particularly economically. Head off the motorway and you’ll find the MG GS doesn’t feel particularly relaxing to drive. Its suspension is firmer than in the likes of the Nissan Qashqai so you’ll feel more of a thud each time you hit a pothole around town. At least you get a decent view out and the optional automatic gearbox you can get in top-spec models means you don’t have to make endless gear changes in heavy traffic. Unlike most SUVs, you can’t get the GS with automatic emergency braking, lane-keeping assistance or driver tiredness detection. As a result, you’ll be better off looking elsewhere if safety is your number one priority. But, if you’re after a sporty-looking yet practical SUV on a shoestring budget, it could be worth a look.

mg,general,"Is the MG5 EV a good car? This is the MG5 EV, and it’s one of very few electric estate cars currently available in the UK – the others being the Porsche Taycan Sport Turismo, Vauxhall Astra Sports Tourer Electric and Peugeot e-308 SW. It’s a bit like doing your shopping at Lidl or Aldi. On the face of things, you may dismiss the MG5 as simply being a value option - but if you’re clued up, you’ll know there’s much more to it than that. The MG5 was given a design overhaul in 2022 and it was much-needed, though it also came with a small bump in price. The dowdy car of old has been replaced with a stylish new look, sporting sharp lines in the bumpers and wide, narrow headlights. It’s not quite as striking as the Carwow 2023 Car of the Year, the MG4 hatch, though. On the inside, the MG5 isn’t quite as smart either, but it’s a definite improvement over the pre-revision car. Build quality is really good and there’s a respectable amount of plush-feeling materials. Fabric seats come as standard, though range-topping models get a leatherette set. Sitting at the heart of the dashboard is an updated 10.25-inch infotainment system. It’s certainly a leap from the older, sluggish screen and, if you’d rather mirror your smartphone, it comes with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay as standard. It does retain a part-digital, part-analogue driver’s display, though this feels pretty clunky and would work better as a fully digital unit. Updates have made the MG5 EV much more attractive, but it’s a shame a little price rise came too Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer There’s lots of knee and headroom in the back seats of the MG5, however a raised footwell does leave your rear passengers angled rather awkwardly. As for boot space, you’ve got 580 litres to work with in the MG5. That’s only slightly down on the Toyota Corolla Touring Sports’ 598 litres, so it’s a useful space that will easily carry large suitcases. Choosing the motor and battery is easy, because, well, there is no choice. Whichever MG5 trim you choose you get a battery with a usable capacity of 57kWh and a 156hp motor. That said, driving range is 250 miles in the entry-level SE version or 235 miles in the higher-spec Trophy model, thanks largely to the bigger alloy wheels. The MG5 is comfortable in town and on the motorway, and you get the MG Pilot safety system as standard, which includes assistance kit such as adaptive cruise control and lane-keep assist. If you like the sound of the MG5 EV you can check out the latest new deals now or browse used stock from dealers near you. You can also take a look at other used MG models.

byd,general,"Is the BYD Dolphin a good car? The BYD Dolphin is a mid-sized electric car bringing good levels of equipment and decent practicality, as well as a low starting price – all attributes that make it highly attractive if you're in the market for an EV and you don't want an SUV. Chinese brand BYD launched in the UK with the Atto 3 SUV, and its second model, also all-electric, is the Dolphin. Think of it as a pocket telescope - not impressive in size, but its compact dimensions belie its abilities to show users more than they bargained for. For example, the entry car’s price undercuts potential alternatives such as the MG 4, and significantly undercuts the likes of the Cupra Born, VW ID3 and Smart #1, as well as the smaller Renault Zoe and Peugeot e-208. But equipment levels impress, with kit including electrically adjustable vegan leather seats, a 360-degree surround camera and 12.8-inch rotatable screen all standard on even the entry car. But only the cars over £30,000 get the longer-range battery. And yep, rotatable. At the touch of a button, as long as you’re not using the landscape-only Apple CarPlay/Android Auto, the big infotainment screen will switch from landscape to portrait or back again. Most people will pick a layout and stick with it, but a neat party trick nonetheless. BYD Dolphin: electric range, battery and charging data Range: 196-265 milesEfficiency: 3.9-4.1mi/kWhBattery size: 45kWh / 60kWhMax charge speed: 150kWCharge time AC: 5hrs, 0-100%, 11kW / 6hrs 12mins, 0-100%, 11kWCharge time DC: 40mins, 10-80%, 150kWCharge port location: Right side frontPower outputs: 95hp / 177hp / 204hp The Dolphin comes in four different trim levels, only two of which offer the same battery, power, range and charging stats. At the bottom is the Active which has 95hp and a 211-mile range, while the top-spec Design has 204hp and 265 miles of range. We’ll go into more detail on the different options later on, and the two lower-price cars aren't available until a couple of months after launch. Once past the slightly odd name, the Dolphin has a subtly inoffensive style to it; nothing likely to court car park controversy, but it’s neat enough. On the inside, there is plenty to catch the eye, from the rounded set of switches below the screen that also house the gear selector, to the sweeping air vent surrounds that form part of a dynamic line across the dashboard. Rear seat space is surprisingly good for a car that doesn’t have a big footprint, with taller adults easily able to get comfortable one behind the other. That’s helped by the flat floor – a result of clever battery packaging – and the fact that you can get your feet just about under the front seats. Three rear passengers will be a squeeze though, which isn’t a big surprise in a fairly compact hatchback. Be aware that the bigger battery is only available with the more expensive Dolphin models - the more affordable ones are comparatively down on range Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Boot space is reasonable, and there’s a handy removable rubber mat to keep wet dogs or muddy boots off the carpeted moveable boot floor. It’s a deep space when set in the lower position, and offers a little more room that a Smart #1, Renault Zoe or MG 4, although not quite as much as a Volkswagen ID3 or Cupra Born. To drive, the most powerful of the three power options is a little too powerful for the tyres, especially in the wet where they have a tendency to easily spin the wheels. BYD has acknowledged they’re not perfect, and will be changing the tyres it fits to the Dolphin for cars built from November 2023. Otherwise it’s a pleasant and relaxed experience, although the car doesn’t always smooth itself over urban bumps. But it’s grown-up enough to settle in fine on longer runs, and the light steering is welcome for low-speed manoeuvring, although at higher speeds the standard setting is too light for engaging or spirited driving. It can be altered in the menus though, which helps. Much like the Fiat 500e, the Dolphin’s smaller battery should be ignored by anyone venturing far from home. The lower range is fine for urban jaunts, but the extra capacity of the bigger battery provides significant peace of mind. The Dolphin looks neat and tidy without breaking any new ground styling-wise, and is a well-rounded, well-equipped and practical car that opens up the electric hatchback choices even further.

byd,general,"Is the BYD Seal U a good car? It’s not immediately obvious what sort of car the BYD Seal U is from the name alone - it sounds like it should be related to the all-electric BYD Seal saloon. However, it’s instead a plug-in hybrid family-sized SUV which majors on value - coming in comfortably cheaper than many much smaller hatchbacks and SUVs. It’s also quite a frustrating car, as it doesn’t do things by halves. In some aspects it’s good - very good, arguably near the top of its class. In others, however, it’s firmly near the bottom, making it difficult to recommend. It’s like buying products from Temu or Aliexpress - they can be very good or very bad, but rarely are they just average. The Seal U is a similar size to plug-in hybrid SUVs such as the Hyundai Tucson, Ford Kuga and Volkswagen Tiguan, but it’s closer in price to cars such as the Kia Niro or Jeep Renegade, both of which are a lot smaller. The closest alternative is the MG HS, which comes in at a similar size and a similar price for its plug-in hybrid variant. The BYD Seal U starts on the back foot because of its design. Whereas BYD’s other cars are at least distinctive if not particularly pretty, the Seal U looks like every other SUV was popped into a blender. It’s so anonymous that it would make the perfect getaway car, but the result is that you don’t feel particularly proud or excited to be climbing aboard. At least you’ll have plenty of room inside. Space in the front and rear seats is excellent, with space for a six-foot passenger to stretch out behind a driver of a similar size. The boot isn’t quite so impressive, at 425 litres in capacity - most alternatives offer more room. It’s still a useful space, though, as it’s deep and wide - just not very tall. The BYD Seal U really isn’t good to drive, but it’s so affordable and decently practical it’s difficult to complain too much Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Those sat up front enjoy loads of tech as standard, and a cabin design that’s rather more distinctive than the exterior styling. You get BYD’s trademark rotating touchscreen infotainment system - 15.6-inches across, it’s huge, clear and responsive, even if the interface doesn’t always make the most sense. Other luxurious features include things like full-cabin air purification, which senses when there are lots of pollutants outside (or even inside) the vehicle and can filter them out. It’s driving the Seal U which highlights its Marmite nature more than anything else. The hybrid powertrain is truly excellent, but the rest of the driving experience is very poor. The Seal U runs on its electric motors most of the time, with the petrol engine acting mostly as a generator and only kicking in fully if you put your foot all the way down. That means progress is smooth, if not hugely rapid, and makes the Seal U fantastic for driving around town. Good range on a charge and a generally quiet cabin free of too much wind and road noise further this aspect. But the Seal U’s suspension is so soft that it wallows over bumps like a ship in rough seas, and the steering is so light that it feels as if you’re driving a remote controlled-car. This is especially a shame given that the Seal saloon with which the Seal U (sort of) shares a name is really good to drive.

byd,general,"Is the BYD Atto 3 a good car? Another day and another family-oriented electric SUV to bring you. This is the BYD Atto 3, fresh from China, and aiming to find a place on your shortlist if you’re looking at cars like the Peugeot e-2008, MG ZS EV or Kia Niro EV. Like discovering after a few years working together that you went to school with your colleague on the desk across from you, the BYD Atto 3 may be more familiar than you realise. BYD has been manufacturing everything from smartphone components to electric buses since its inception in 1995, and recently has been selling cars in its home market. Now, it wants a slice of the UK pie. At first glance though, it’s not doing too much to stand out. Though its design is inoffensive (‘Build Your Dreams’ badging aside), there’s little about the car that’ll turn your head away from the plethora of choices you have in this segment. Fortunately, the same can’t be said for the eccentric interior. Be it the muscle membrane-like trim inserts, eye-catching vegan leather colour combination or the (functional) guitar strings across the door bins, there’s no accusing the Atto 3 of lacking character inside. BYD Atto 3: electric range, battery and charging data Range: 261 milesEfficiency: 4.0 miles per kWhBattery size: 60kWhMax charge speed: 150kWCharge time AC: 9hrs 42mins, 0-100%, 7kWCharge time DC: 44mins, 10-80%, 150kWCharge port location: Right frontPower outputs: 204hp Better still, build quality is impressive, as you’ll be hard-pressed to find cheap-feeling materials (unless you look way under the dashboard) – a rarity nowadays on more affordable cars. A 12.8-inch infotainment system comes as standard, with a 15.6-inch screen fitted to top-spec Design models. There’s a bit of a party trick to it too, as it’s able to rotate from landscape to portrait at the press of a button. Amusing for a brief moment, though you’ll likely find a preference quickly and leave it untouched. The software on the system itself is pretty intuitive – it’s essentially just an Android tablet. There are some teething issues to solve, though. You do get Apple CarPlay, but there's no Android Auto yet – said to be coming as a no-cost update sometime in the future – and the ‘Hey BYD’ voice assistant adapting to some of the UK’s more regional accents would be welcome. Legroom in the rear of the BYD Atto 3 is decent, though you may be left wanting more headroom. Kids in car seats will be fine, but it’s something to consider if you’re ferrying teenagers or adults around often. It’s a similar story for boot space, too; 440 litres of storage isn’t woeful, but it’s beaten by the Kia Niro EV and MG ZS EV, although it is marginally better than the similarly-sized Peugeot e-2008. The BYD Atto 3 has a quirky interior design – it's smart, but the guitar strings on the doors are just odd Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer All versions of the BYD Atto 3 are powered by a single electric motor, drawing power from a 60.5kWh battery. Official testing has its range at 260 miles, though a cold March day of driving the car in mixed conditions returned 3.3mi/kWh, equating to less than 200 miles of real-world range. If you’re planning to use your Atto 3 as an urban runaround, you’ll be happy to know it’s pleasant to use around town. Visibility is good all-round, and a standard-fit 360-degree camera is a nice addition for parking. Supple suspension results in a comfy ride over bumps in the road, too. That translates nicely out on the motorway as well, though prepare yourself for a lot of wind noise at higher speeds. On a back road, the BYD Atto 3 will wobble around a bit and doesn’t offer much in the way of excitement, but that’s hardly a dealbreaker for cars like this. For a first foray into the UK market, the BYD Atto 3 is a respectable effort. It offers the value and quality to seriously consider compared with the established names, though it lacks some of the polish you find from more familiar brands and that lack of space may prove a sticking point.

byd,general,"Is the BYD Seal a good car? The BYD Seal is a bit like the kid who joins the school halfway through Year 11 and yet finishes the year as rugby captain, prefect and top of the exam tables. You see, while BYD has only been selling cars in the UK since summer 2023, the Seal is an electric saloon car that displays maturity and ability that you’d expect from a highly established European manufacturer. In fact, in many ways it’s actually an improvement on the Tesla Model 3 and Hyundai Ioniq 6 which constitute its two closest alternatives. Other electric cars you might consider are the Polestar 2 and BMW i4. While BYD may have launched the Sealion 7 and Seal U in the years since, the Seal is still a better car than either. Ignore the slightly odd naming convention for a while, though, and focus for a second on the styling - which is great. The Seal is a similar shape to the Tesla Model 3, being a saloon car with a dropped snout and rounded roofline - but it has more intricate detailing around the headlights and a neat lightbar at the rear. It’s a bit less anonymous than the Tesla without being too glam. On the inside, though, it’s like BYD’s stylists took one look at Tesla’s minimalist approach and simply said ‘no, thank you’. The dashboard is very distinctive as a result, with air vents that seamlessly mould into full-width panels running across the cabin. There are posh quilted seats and a panel of switchgear in the centre. It all feels quite upmarket, if unconventional. BYD Seal: electric range, battery and charging data Range: 323-354 milesEfficiency: 3.4-3.7mi/kWhBattery size: 83kWh Max charge speed: 150kWCharge time DC: 37mins, 10-80%, 150kWCharge port location: Right side rearPower outputs: 313hp / 530hp Even more unconventional is the infotainment screen, which is a huge 15.6-inches across. BYD’s party piece is that the screen physically rotates from portrait to landscape at the touch of a button. The company says this is because things like the sat-nav are better in portrait mode, but as the standard-fit Apple CarPlay and Android Auto only works in landscape you’ll probably leave the rotating trick as a once-in-a-blue-moon showoff rather than a regular feature. The interface isn’t quite as good as you get in a Model 3 or Ioniq 6, either. The BYD Seal’s screen is bright, clear and responsive, but common functions are buried just a few menus too deep with buttons that are too hard to hit on the move. Drivers and front passengers of all sizes will be able to get comfy up front in those squashy, quilted leather seats, and there’s good stowage for smaller items too. The back seats are a bit more of a squeeze, with decent legroom but headroom that’s limited by the huge panoramic glass roof. There’s a lot to like about the Seal, but it’s a shame so many functions go through the touchscreen that’s too hard to use while driving Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Boot space of 402 litres matches the Ioniq 6 but trails the Model 3. There is a handy front boot for storing charge cables, though. Just note that, as a saloon car, the Seal isn’t as practical for large items as a Polestar 2. To drive, the Seal is deeply impressive. Even the standard rear-wheel drive model is quick, but performance from the all-wheel drive, 530hp Excellence version is mind-bending and, unlike a Tesla, totally repeatable. Responsive and accurate steering, plus suspension that strikes a great balance between comfort and cornering, means it’s even a good amount of fun on a twisty road. Competitive range figures of 323 - 354 miles are the icing on the cake, though it’s a shame there’s no super-long range version to challenge the best Tesla Model 3. Still, the BYD Seal is a car that should definitely be on your shortlist. Interested? Check out our best BYD Seal deals here, or get a great price on a BYD Seal lease.

byd,general,"Is the BYD Sealion 7 a good car? The BYD Sealion 7 is a roomy electric SUV with sporty looks, impressive specs and a very reasonable price tag - on paper, a brilliant alternative to electric vehicles such as the Tesla Model Y, Kia EV6 or Peugeot E-3008. BYD’s models can be a bit hit and miss, though. The Seal and Dolphin are really good electric cars, but the Seal U plug-in hybrid SUV is rather disappointing. The Sealion 7 is a mixed bag - it's not as outwardly brilliant as the Seal, but it's far better than the Seal U and a credible alternative to the aforementioned Tesla. The Sealion 7 gets off to a reasonable start because while it’s not exactly handsome, it’s a bit less anonymous than the Seal U. BYD’s signature headlight design features C-shape LEDs, sat above a chunky bumper design with big air intakes. A sleek, sloping roofline trails rearward to a tailgate spoiler and a full-width rear lightbar. Inside, things are a bit less lukewarm - it’s genuinely nice inside, with posh-feeling materials swaddling every surface and an interesting dashboard design covered in flowing lines. There’s a huge 15.6-inch infotainment screen with BYD’s trademark rotating party trick - this is cool the first few times, but is likely to be relegated to gimmick status after you’ve shown your mates. BYD Sealion 7: electric range, battery and charging data Range: 283-312 milesBattery size: 82.5kWh / 91.3kWhMax charge speed: 150kW / 230kWCharge time DC: 32mins, 10-80%, 150kW / 24mins, 10-80%, 230kWCharge port location: Right side rearPower outputs: 313hp / 530hp There are some materials that feel a little bit cheap considering that the Sealion 7 isn’t a budget machine, but overall it feels quite premium - even if it’s lacking the wow factor of a Peugeot E-3008. No such caveats when it comes to the space on offer, though. The front seats are big, squashy and comfortable, and the storage solutions for smaller items are useful - but the back seats are huge, so rear passengers will be able to stretch out as much as they’d like. You won’t have any issues fitting lanky teens or bulky child seats back here, though the middle seat backrest is quite uncomfortable so it’s certainly better for two people. At 520 litres in capacity, boot space can’t hold a candle to the Tesla Model Y but it’s pretty good compared with most other alternatives. There’s a deep underfloor storage compartment and even a useful ‘frunk’ where you’d find the engine on a combustion-powered car. If you’re looking for lots of space in the cabin, the BYD Sealion 7 could be appealing, but it’s far from best-in-class in most other areas… Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The Sealion 7 offers a choice of two large battery packs, with a claimed range of between 283-312 miles. That sounds good on paper, but during our testing we saw really poor efficiency which would suggest that even the larger battery will only return a figure in the 200s. Not so good. It is powerful, though, and the motors are smooth and silent, so getting up to speed on the motorway is easy. It’s a shame that the rest of the car isn’t quite as refined - there’s a lot of wind noise and tyre roar. Worse still, the Sealion 7’s suspension feels very unsettled. It bounces a lot over bumps, and you can feel the body moving long after you've passed a road imperfection. It’s like being in a rather unstable ship at sea. On top of this, twitchy and hyperactive steering means it’s not even much fun to drive down a twisting B-road, which is a shame. The Sealion 7 is an interesting left-field choice if you value technology and passenger space, but the alternatives all have more enticing driving dynamics and better range, for less cash.

volkswagen,general,"Is the Volkswagen Touareg a good car? The Volkswagen Touareg may not have quite the badge cachet of the Audi Q7 and Mercedes GLE, but nevertheless, it’s a big, spacious, high-tech SUV that’s also very comfortable. Think of the Touareg, then, as Waitrose rather than Harrods Food Hall. It’s easily posh enough for the majority of people, but might not be plush enough for those used to the finer things in life. Volkswagen gave the Touareg a little nip and tuck in 2023, which introduced a new-look grille at the front, updated bumpers and a full-width rear light bar (which includes a questionable illuminated VW badge). It’s not as instantly recognisable as a Porsche Cayenne, but it’s inoffensively handsome. It’s a bit more impressive inside, with the central touchscreen that blends into a 15.0-inch digital driver’s display. The central screen is larger than anything you’ll find in an Audi, BMW, Mercedes or maybe even your local Vue cinema, and controls almost all of the VW’s features – from the sat nav to the climate control. This is all standard on post-2023 models. Group test: Audi Q7 v BMW X5 v Mercedes GLE v Porsche Cayenne v VW Touareg It’s not just high-tech, because the Touareg comes with a slick, sweeping cabin design that looks suitably upmarket, but a few cheap-feeling materials do let the Volkswagen down a bit, such as on the centre console and lower surfaces of the dashboard. Overall it’s a very plush place to sit, but for the price the likes of BMW and Audi do it better. The VW Touareg’s excellent practicality means you might be able to forgive a few scratchy pieces of plastic, however. There’s ample space for very tall adults in both the front and rear seats, and – besides the rather shallow tray under the armrest – all its cubby holes and storage bins are pretty generous. The ISOFIX anchor points are a doddle to access, too, and the large rear door openings make it easy to fit a bulky child seat. It’s not just spacious in the back seats, because the Volkswagen Touareg comes with a seriously big boot, too. With the back seats in place, there’s more room for a few sets of golf clubs or a large baby buggy than in anything else you might be considering – though the Audi Q7 and Mercedes GLE have a bit more room with the back seats folded. It’s a shame there’s no seven-seat option, though. There are five engine options, but VW’s 231hp 3.0-litre diesel engine fits the bill perfectly for most. This turbocharged V6 has plenty of grunt to pull heavy trailers or blast past slow-moving traffic. It’s impressively quiet around town and whispers along almost silently at motorway speeds, though company car buyers will be more tempted by the lower tax you get with the plug-in hybrids. The Volkswagen Touareg is a lovely thing to cruise around in comfort, it’s just a shame it’s not a bit cheaper Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Driving the Volkswagen Touareg is pretty relaxing – despite its daunting size. You get a good view out and the light steering makes squeezing through tight spaces as easy as in any large SUV. If you spend lots of time driving in town, the optional four-wheel steering is well worth considering – it helps make the VW Touareg even more manoeuvrable by altering the angle of both the front and rear wheels to help you turn as tightly as possible. The standard automatic gearbox changes gear smoothly and doesn’t jerk or stutter at slow speeds, though it can be a bit slow to respond when you put your foot down on the motorway, though the Touareg is incredibly quiet and comfortable when driving at higher speeds. And that’s where much of its appeal lies, coupled with the spacious cabin and boot. It’s just a shame that the Touareg is a similar price to posher alternatives such as the Audi Q7 and BMW X5. As a result, you’re going to want to head over to Carwow’s Volkswagen Touareg deals page to see how much you could save, or browse the latest used Touareg stock available from our network of trusted dealers.

volkswagen,general,"Is the Volkswagen ID3 a good car? The Volkswagen ID3 is basically the electric car equivalent to the Volkswagen Golf. It’s a mid-sized family hatchback which is the baby of Volkswagen’s EV range. Launched in 2019 and updated in 2023, the ID3 will fall on your shortlist if you’re considering other small-ish electric cars such as the Kia EV3, MG4 EV, Renault Megane E-Tech, or Tesla Model 3. The ID3 is as futuristic as it gets from Volkswagen, but being the brand of the ‘people’s car’ such modernism still has to be user-friendly and carefully implemented. A bit like trying to introduce your grandma to her new mobile phone. Before its facelift, the ID3 didn’t do this especially well and attracted criticism for its awkward user interface, but the 2023 update went a long way to addressing this with a new infotainment system and improved interior materials. The ID3 is a different shape to most hatchbacks - it’s quite tall, almost like a mini-MPV. A short bonnet, steep windscreen and big wheels all mean it stands out from the crowd. It’s not exactly handsome, but it’s a clean design - improved in the 2023 facelift which took away a set of silly decals that used to be standard on the rear pillar. Volkswagen ID3: electric range, battery and charging data Range: 261-369 milesEfficiency: 4.1-4.3 miles per kWhBattery size: 52kWh/ 58kWh / 77kWh / 79kWhMax charge speed: 120kW / 170kW / 185kWCharge time AC: 9hrs 30mins, 0-100%, 7kW / 12hrs 40mins, 0-100%, 7kWCharge time DC: 35mins, 5-80%, 120kW / 30mins, 5-80%, 170kWCharge port location: Right rearPower outputs: 170hp / 204hp / 326hp It’s even more minimalist on the inside. You get very few physical buttons, with most controls being routed through either the 12.9-inch touchscreen display or the touch-sensitive steering wheel buttons. In a bid to remove as much switchgear as possible Volkswagen’s even shunned separate controls for the rear windows. All this tech can be quite annoying to use - particularly the touch-sensitive sliders underneath the infotainment screen, which aren’t backlit at night and are really tricky to find when you’re driving. Space in the cabin benefits from the ID3’s tall silhouette, with good headroom and plenty of legroom. There’s a totally flat floor and the centre console is low, giving a nice feeling of airiness - helped by loads of glass, particularly the extra windows in the windscreen pillars that give you a good view at junctions. There are a choice of battery sizes and electric motors. The basic ‘Pure’ models can go around 240 miles on a charge and have modest performance, but you can step up through Pro and Pro S models with increasingly bigger ranges. The top model is the GTX - a performance-biased model that gets a sporty makeover, the biggest battery and the most powerful electric motor. The ID3 has a spacious interior and drives well - but the minimalist dashboard may wind you up Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer All ID3s are rear-wheel drive and feel nice and solid on the road. Bumps and potholes are a bit too obvious, especially in models wearing the largest 20-inch alloy wheels, but the steering feels accurate and the turning circle is really tight. It’s good on a longer run too, with punch acceleration and good refinement at a cruise. What it’s not is particularly exciting - even the hot hatchback-like ID3 GTX. There’s a nice sensation that the rear-wheel drive is pushing you out of corners rather than pulling you around them, but otherwise there’s little enjoyment to be had - instead it feels neutral and safe. So while the VW ID3 is a pretty good electric car, it’s also one that struggles to stand out - there are loads of cheaper alternatives which are just as practical and feel every bit as solid and reassuring, even if they don’t quite have the Volkswagen’s badge kudos. If you’re interested, check out the best Volkswagen ID3 deals right here on Carwow. You can get a great price with our Volkswagen ID3 leasing deals, or find a used Volkswagen ID3 for sale too.

volkswagen,general,"Is the Volkswagen ID4 a good car? You love SUVs and more and more of you are loving electric cars, that makes the new Volkswagen ID4 electric SUV a case of possibly the right product at the right time. Although, with some impressive alternatives like the Tesla Model Y and Nissan Ariya also joining the fray, it doesn’t quite have things all its own way. The VW ID4 is about the same size as the company’s Tiguan SUV and should be just as practical – but a bit more futuristic-looking. If you and your sibling are the VW Golf and Tiguan, then the ID3 and ID4 are a bit like your posh cousins who always have the latest fashion and tech. You get a number of engine and battery options, with power outputs spanning 146hp to 295hp, and ranges starting at 213 miles and going up to 328 miles. Rear-wheel-drive is standard with top specs getting all-wheel-drive. The ID4 is supposed to follow the look of the ID3 and like that car, it has slim LED headlights connected by a full-width LED light bar, while a large intake sits low on the bumper. You’ll spot that there’s no grille (electric cars don’t need them because they don’t have a hot engine to cool). Volkswagen ID4: Electric range, battery and charging data Range: 317-337 milesEfficiency: 3.9-4.1 miles per kWhBattery size: 77kWhMax charge speed: 135kW / 175kWCharge time AC: 12hrs 40mins, 0-100% at 7kWCharge time DC: 28 mins, 10-80% at 135kW / 28 mins, 0-80% at 175kWCharge port location: Right rearPower outputs: 282hp / 335hp And that’s about it for the front-end highlights. At the back, a wide lightbar mimics the similar element of the front of the car. But with a high bonnet and bulbous back end, the ID4 is a bit blobby and heavy-looking. It has a simpler design inside, though. For a start, there’s no gear lever — rather, you simply twist a large knob behind the steering wheel, similar to that on a BMW i3. However, the wheel obscures the switch, so you have to crane around the rim to see it. Speaking of that driver’s display, it gives you key information, such as speed and charge status, on a sharp display. For other functions, there’s a 10.0-inch infotainment system, or 12.0-inch on top trims. There are comparatively few buttons, because most functions are operated through the central screen. You can also use your voice to control the infotainment settings on the move, although as with many systems of this kind it can be glitchy. The looks might not be to all tastes, but there's a good all-round EV underneath the ID4's skin Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Interior quality isn’t great either – there are some scratchy plastics – but at least the ID4 is comfortable. There’s lots of adjustment for the driver’s seat and steering wheel so you should be able to find a good driving position. And there’s loads of space in the rear seat, so passengers in the back should be comfy too – even in the middle seat. As for boot space, the Volkswagen ID4 offers 543 litres — ever so slightly more than the 510 litres in the BMW iX3’s boot. To keep with the Volkswagen Tiguan comparison, the ID4 doesn’t quite match its 615 litres, but given the size of the batteries underneath the floor in the ID4 it’s a fair effort.

volkswagen,general,"Is the Volkswagen ID.5 a good car? Much like a Golden Retriever in a baseball cap and running shoes, the Volkswagen ID5 is the sporty-looking version of the sensible ID4 electric SUV. It’s much the same car, but where the ID4 has a big, boxy rear end the ID5 has a rakish roofline instead. You still get tall, bluff front and rear ends - a la ID4 - with big, aggressive head lights and curves aplenty. At the back is the same light bar too, but the ID5 has a little boot spoiler on the edge of the tailgate. It’s a decent looking thing, less frumpy than the ID4, though still less distinctive than the Audi Q4 e-tron Sportback and Skoda Enyaq Coupe. At first glance the interior is much the same fare as the outside, sleek and minimalistic with a few swoopy lines on the dashboard and a pair of modern-looking displays. It doesn’t take long to realise that the interior quality isn’t up to par though, with far too many scratchy, hard plastics in easy to reach places spoiling the cabin. Volkswagen ID.5: electric range, battery and charging data Range: 226-344 milesEfficiency: 3.7-3.9 miles per kWhBattery size: 52kWh / 77kWh / 79kWhMax charge speed: 135kWCharge time AC: 12hrs, 0-100% at 7kW / 8hrs, 0-100% at 22kWCharge time DC: 30 mins, 20-80% at 135kWCharge port location: Left rightPower outputs: 170hp / 286hp / 344hp It’s a shame as there are some really clever touches inside the ID5. The latest version of the infotainment is slick and easy to use, unlike some recent Volkswagen attempts, and the optional augmented reality head-up display is reassuring on the motorway as you don’t need to look away from the road as often. Yes the touchscreen climate controls are still a bit fiddly to use, but they don’t take long to get used to. The seats are especially comfortable with loads of adjustability, and there’s good front cabin storage including a deep centre console cubby and big door pockets. The rear bench is comfy, with good legroom and a surprisingly large amount of headroom for such a low roofline. It’s just a shame the boot’s shape is compromised by the sloping tailgate, because while it’s larger than the ID4’s at 549 litres, you can’t fit particularly boxy items in. Still, with a comfy interior and a big boot the ID5 makes for a great road trip EV, especially with a claimed range of up to 343 miles with the biggest battery. The entry-level model has a smaller battery with a max range of 226 miles. We managed respectable efficiency of 3.6mi/kWh on a long drive, largely on the motorway, in the long range model. That equates to a real-world range of 277 miles - 80% of Volkswagen’s claim. A twisty road is far from fun in the ID5 though, with steering that’s devoid of any sense of what the front wheels are doing. You need to put a lot of angle into turning the steering wheel, even in sport more, so while there’s plenty of grip you’re best off driving the ID5 at a moderate pace. The ID5’s coupe roofline does make it easier on the eyes than the blobby, bloated-looking ID4, but I’m still not sure I’d call it a handsome car Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Motorways are much better, even if there’s a touch too much wind noise, but the clever suite of driving assistance tech combined with a good high-speed comfort make the ID5 an easy car to cover ground in. The city is where it feels most at home, though it’s a tricky car to place on the road. The bonnet lines make it hard to judge the ID5’s size, which combined with the slow steering and spongy brakes can knock your confidence when manoeuvring down a tight city street. Bigger bumps are absorbed rather effectively, but potholes and cracked roads aren’t smoothed out as well as they are in alternatives such as the Volvo EX30 and Kia EV6. Good looks, useful practicality and real-world efficiency mean the ID5 is a perfectly adequate family SUV, but it does lose its shine thanks to some disappointing driving characteristics and questionable interior materials. Still, it’s worth considering, so you can check out our new Volkswagen ID5 deals or have a look at our ID5 leasing options instead. You can also browse used ID5s from our network of trusted dealers, or other used Volkswagens if you’re open to other options.

volkswagen,general,"Is the Volkswagen ID7 a good car? The fourth model in Volkswagen’s electric car line-up, the ID7 is a family saloon with a sporty design that should appeal to you if you haven’t succumbed to the SUV fever that has taken hold of buyers in the last decade or so. As a left-field alternative to the SUV, it’s a bit like sticking with skinny jeans when the on-trend fashionable types have moved on to baggier ones. First impressions are strong, with the long ID7 (it’s a shade under five metres from bumper to bumper) looking like a modern family car, with a swooping roof that makes it look slick and sporty. Inside, there’s plenty of space throughout, with a lot of legroom and headroom – despite the fact that the ID7 has the lowest roof of any of VW’s electric models. The boot has a 532-litre capacity, increasing to 1,586 litres if you lower the rear seats, so it should be enough for most family uses. If not, the more practical ID7 Tourer could be worth waiting for. Helping to make the cabin more airy is an optional full-length glass roof with smart glass, where the layers of glass in the sunroof can be electronically switched between opaque and clear, using a slider in the roof or voice control (which we’ll come to in a minute). Car manufacturers are very keen on introducing new technologies in their shiny, new zero-emissions vehicles: in this case, Volkswagen’s nifty innovation is an augmented-reality head-up display (HUD), which comes as standard on all ID7s. VW's new electric flagship looks like great value if you take its size and range into consideration Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The HUD is some pretty clever tech, but it’s also significant because it has a knock-on effect on the layout of the cockpit. The traditional instruments become smaller (because the driver won’t need to look at them as much) which is an innovation that works well, while Volkswagen has also given the infotainment system a more intuitive menu structure on its 15.0-inch touchscreen. Another way in which the ID7 hints at what will be the norm in future cars is the voice control feature. Voice controls aren’t new, by any means, but systems like the ID7’s are now more like the ones on smartphones, responding to commands or questions that are spoken more naturally. Whether that means it will interrupt the conversations between the driver and front-seat passenger (awkward!) remains to be seen. In the future, it'll even be integrated with AI functionality from ChatGPT. As the ID7 is a relatively large car, there’s plenty of room under the floor for a battery pack – and the first versions of the model to go on sale have a 77kWh battery. This bigger-than-average battery means that the ID7 has a range of up to 386 miles, with its 286hp motor enabling a respectable 6.5-second 0-62mph time. A version with an even larger battery will arrive later in 2024 with a range of about 430 miles – enough to drive from London to Edinburgh without stopping (theoretically, although your bladder might have something to say). The onboard charging system is pretty state of the art, too. You can charge an ID7 on one of those fancy (and expensive) ultra-rapid chargers at the motorway services, taking enough electricity in 10 minutes to cover 126 miles: you can also charge a battery at 10% up to 80% in 28 minutes. If all this sounds good, keep reading for our full take on the ID7.

volkswagen,general,"Is the Volkswagen ID7 Tourer a good car? Volkswagen has a long history of making great, large estate cars - the VW ID7 Tourer is the company’s latest, and in many ways one of its best. It’s a large, family-sized electric car, but being an estate instead of an SUV means it’s both better to drive and look at than VW’s own ID4 or ID5 models. Compared to those two cars, it’s like the annoying overachieving sibling - it’s handsomer, better at everything and should by all rights be the most popular. Yet the craze for SUVs means many buyers will look right past it, which is a shame. There are a few all-electric estate car alternatives to the ID7 Tourer, but they’re either a fair bit cheaper or much, much more expensive. In the former camp there’s the MG5 EV and above that, the closely-related Vauxhall Astra Sports Tourer Electric and Peugeot E-308 SW. On the other side, the BMW i5 Touring and Porsche Taycan Sport Turismo offer much more of a luxury experience - but with far more of a luxury price tag. Volkswagen ID7 Tourer: electric range, battery and charging data Range: 358 - 424 milesEfficiency: 4.1 - 4.9 mi/kWhBattery size: 77kWh/86kWhMax charge speed: 175kW/200kWCharge time AC: 11hrs 55m/12hrs 50m 0-100%Charge time DC: 30m 10-80%Charge port location: Right rearPower outputs: 286hp/340hp The ID7 Tourer looks great from the outside. It has a minimalist aesthetic, like Volkswagen’s other electric cars, and the design is dominated by a full-width lightbar at either end. The front one even incorporates a light-up Volkswagen logo, so that everyone knows what you’re driving even after dark. On the inside, practicality is a very strong point. Even when the front seats are all the way back, there’s room in the rear for a six-footer to get really comfortable - and thanks to the Tourer’s greater headroom compared to the ID7 hatch, they’ll have even more space. Meanwhile, the ID7 Tourer’s boot is larger than any other electric estate car on sale - it’s also bigger than VW’s own ID4 SUV. Interior quality is a step up compared to the other cars in the ID line-up. Everything feels nicely-built, but there’s still an over-reliance on screens over physical buttons. Other than a hazard warning switch, everything on the ID7’s interior is controlled through either the central touchscreen or the touch-sensitive steering wheel controls. The Volkswagen ID7 Tourer is spacious inside, has a massive boot and goes a long way between charges. Still want that SUV? Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer It makes the ID7 quite difficult to recommend to anyone who isn’t a bit of a technophile - having the air-con controls through the screen is one thing, but using it to control the direction of the air vents is a step too far. The ID7 Tourer’s powertrain is tied to the trim level, and there are two battery sizes and two electric motors to choose from. Even the more basic Pro Match model can do over 300 miles on a charge, but if you opt for the Pro S Match version you get an official range of 424 miles - that’s one of the longest-range electric cars on sale. We’ll update this review with driving impressions once we’ve been behind the wheel. If you can’t wait until then, check out Carwow’s Volkswagen ID7 Tourer deals to get a great price.

volkswagen,general,"Is the Volkswagen Tiguan a good car? The Volkswagen Tiguan has one of the simplest recipes of any family SUV. It looks good without being too in-yer-face, is spacious without being intimidating to drive in town, and has a lovely interior without being so posh you’re scared to get your kids’ grubby figures anywhere near it. All features that earned it a Highly Commended award in the Family Values category of the 2025 Carwow Car of the Year Awards. It’s the spaghetti bolognese of the car world. It might be simple but there’s rarely a circumstance where it doesn’t hit the spot. However, like your spaghetti is just one of a number of pasta dishes you could order, there are numerous Tiguan alternatives that are similarly sized, similarly priced SUVs. Go for a top-spec model and it’s an alternative to posh SUVs such as the Audi Q3 and BMW X1, though it does lack some of their badge appeal. Or you could consider an entry-level version alongside a well-specced Nissan Qashqai or Kia Sportage. Where the Volkswagen Tiguan has an advantage over all of those cars is its boot, which at 652 litres is considerably bigger than anything else at a similar price. That means you’ll be able to fit prams and after-school sports equipment all at once, should the need arise. The interior design is all-new, with a massive infotainment touchscreen in the centre of the dashboard, making it not far off those upmarket BMW and Audi alternatives. There are configurable shortcut buttons across the top and bottom of the display, with the large central home screen showing the sat nav, music and other important information. It’s quick to respond to inputs and has bright, clear graphics, but you still get Volkswagen’s unintuitive touch-sensitive sliders for the climate control. On the plus side, you also get an excellent digital instrument display, which is included as standard and bigger than the one on the old Tiguan. The new Volkswagen Tiguan has one of the most modern, high-tech interiors of any mid-sized family SUV Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The exterior hasn’t had quite such an extensive overhaul as the interior, but the old Tiguan was starting to look dated, so the sleek LED headlights that run into a full-width black panel give it a fresh new look. At the back, you get a similar light panel that runs along the bootlid, but the likes of the Kia Sportage are more interesting to look at. A diesel engine is a rare treat these days for those who do big miles, but one of the two petrols will be a better fit for most drivers. A pair of plug-in hybrids are on the way later in 2024, with a useful electric-only range of 62 miles. They will be a bit more expensive than other engines but low running costs could make it the best pick if you have access to regular charging. It’s worth waiting for the plug-in if you need a company car, because it will have the lowest Benefit-in-Kind tax rate by far. There will be no electric Tiguan, so check out our list of the best electric SUVs if that’s what you’re after. Behind the wheel, the Tiguan is quiet, comfortable and refined to drive around town and on the motorway. The suspension is well-judged, so that it soaks up big bumps without causing the body to wobble around. This makes the Tiguan a great car for daily driving duties, but the light steering and refined suspension mean it’s not the most exciting car on a twisty road, even if you pop it into its sportiest setting. If you like what you hear you can see how much you could save with Carwow’s Volkswagen Tiguan deals. You could also get a great deal on the outgoing car by browsing used Tiguan models, as well as extensive stock of other used Volkswagens from our network of trusted dealers.

volkswagen,general,"Is the Volkswagen Passat a good car? The Volkswagen Passat is back, and this time there’s no saloon option – you can only get it as a mega spacious estate. That’s no problem, though, because it has always stood out for being big, practical and not quite as expensive as other Passat alternatives such as the Audi A4 Avant, BMW 3 Series Touring and Mercedes C-Class Estate. (Though the Skoda Superb Estate is the real value wagon.) It’s a bit like buying designer gear from TK Maxx – you’re getting the same sort of quality as you would from a big name store, but you don’t feel quite as posh in the process. Not that the Passat looks like a cheap alternative. It’s always had an understated class, and that continues with the latest model – it’s perhaps not as elegant as its predecessor but it’s certainly smart enough. And if you go for the R-Line model you get a big, imposing grille up front to go with the smart full-width rear light bar that’s standard across the range. It’s inside where Volkswagen has really taken the Passat up a notch, though. There’s a massive infotainment display in the centre of the dashboard that runs Volkswagen’s latest software. It’s a big improvement on recent VW systems, even if it is a touch annoying having to do everything through the screen. Running behind this and into the digital instrument display is an illuminated panel that gives the Passat a cool modern look, particularly at night. Overall build quality and refinement are great, too. The Volkswagen Passat is really practical and comfortable to drive, but it is a bit dull Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer There’s buckets of space whether you’re sitting in the front or the back, and there’s loads of room for a child seat, though an SUV requires you to bend down less. With a boot capacity of 690 litres with all seats in place, or 1,920 litres if you fold the second row down, there’s huge luggage capacity and useful square space that makes it easy to load up. Despite the Passat’s popularity with long-distance drivers, there are no diesel engines anymore. There's a 1.5-litre petrol making 150hp, but company car buyers will be more tempted by one of the two plug-in hybrid options, because of the lower benefit-in-kind rate. Both offer an excellent electric range of up to 80 miles, as well as impressive charge speeds by hybrid standards. They are a great choice if you do a lot of city driving, because the long range means you can pootle around on electric power to keep fuel bills down, but whichever engine you go for the Passat is a refined and comfortable car to cruise around in. It’s at its best on the motorway, and while you do notice a few sharper bumps in the cabin, the car settles quickly. It’s not particularly sporty though, so a BMW 3 Series Touring will be better if you want to make the most of the occasional twisty road. Find out how much you can save by browsing the latest new Volkswagen Passat deals available on Carwow.

volkswagen,general,"Is the Volkswagen Golf a good car? It’s fair to say that the Volkswagen Golf defines the family hatchback - it’s the benchmark by which all of its alternatives such as the Ford Focus, Vauxhall Astra and Honda Civic are measured. At the same time, it’s posh enough that you could quite happily compare it to upmarket cars such as the BMW 1 Series or Audi A3. The Golf is the Coca Cola or Heinz Ketchup of cars - it’s been the default choice for an astonishing amount of buyers in its five decades on sale. And just like coke or ketchup, while there may be alternatives or new players that offer something different - perhaps, in some situations, better - the default choice is still extremely good and hard to top. The current Golf is the Mk8 model, which was first launched in 2020. An update in 2024 took into account customer feedback and made myriad small tweaks and improvements, particularly to the interior and software. The exterior hasn’t had such a big makeover. The new headlights - full LED on all models - are smart, and on some versions joined by a light bar and even an illuminated VW logo. The taillights are slightly updated, too, and the bumpers have been redesigned. It’s still not what you’d call a particularly exciting-looking, but it is smart and inoffensive - which is more than you can say about the latest BMW 1 Series. Inside, the Golf still retains its trademark solid feel which has been an enduringly popular feature ever since the Mk4. For 2024, Volkswagen took in customer feedback, and as a result the new model replaces the old car’s touch-sensitive steering wheel buttons with a full range of physical switches. Video group test: Audi A3 v BMW 1 Series v Mercedes A-Class v Volkswagen Golf The infotainment’s had a serious refresh too, featuring far more user-friendly software, illuminated sliders underneath the screen for quick access to volume and temperature controls, and even the AI ChatGPT built in to answer questions that the native voice assistant can’t figure out. The Golf remains as practical as ever - that is to say, totally middle of the pack. There’s more room for rear passengers than you find in a Mercedes A-Class or BMW 1 Series, but a Skoda Octavia and Ford Focus are more capacious. The boot measures 381 litres, which is again firmly average, for a totally average-sized hatchback. If you need more room, the Golf Estate has an enormous boot and slightly more rear passenger space, while being usefully cheaper than the larger Volkswagen Passat. In contrast to most alternatives, which offer fewer and fewer engines as the years go on, the Golf is available with a huge range of different options. There’s a 1.5-litre petrol, with or without a mild hybrid system and available with two power outputs, with a 2.0-litre version on the way. There’s even a choice of two 2.0-litre diesel engines, perfect for milemunchers. Two plug-in hybrids complete the engine range - a normal model badged eHybrid and the sporty-looking GTE. A refreshed Golf GTI and Golf R will join the range later. There truly is a Golf for everyone - but you can't really go wrong with one of the mid-range petrol versions. Stick to a Ford Focus if you want fun in the corners, though Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Whichever engine you choose you can be assured of a relaxing journey - the Golf majors on its feeling of solidity, refinement and stability. No, it’s not as much fun to drive as a Ford Focus or BMW 1 Series when the road gets twisty, but it’s not too far off, especially if you choose one of the models with adjustable suspension. Higher-powered cars also get more sophisticated rear suspension that helps you corner more quickly and without so much lean. With so much choice in the range - six engine options, five trim levels (plus the standalone GTE) and a massive selection of optional extras, there is a Golf for pretty much anybody - but they’re all damn good cars.

volkswagen,general,"Is the Volkswagen Golf R a good car? The Volkswagen Golf R is the halo version of the ubiquitous hatchback’s range, and a 2024 update brought much-needed improvements to the infotainment system, as well as a welcome dose of extra performance. The R is in distinguished company, with all-wheel drive hot hatch alternatives including the Audi S3, BMW M135 and Mercedes-AMG A35, with less refined, more driver-focused options such as the Honda Civic Type R and Toyota GR Yaris also on the radar. If the standard Golf is a korma then the R – with the extra power that comes as part of the latest update – is like ordering a vindaloo, then sprinkling chilli flakes on top. The updated version of the Mk8 Volkswagen Golf R – known as the 8.5 – gets more aggressive styling than the regular Golf, but the update also brings with it new bumper designs, LED headlights and an illuminated VW badge up front. The jury’s still out on that one. Inside there’s one key change. The infotainment system is much-improved, with a bigger display, faster processing and redesigned interface that’s more intuitive to use. It’s still some way off the best alternatives, and we still encountered frustrations with smartphone connectivity, for example, but it’s much better than before. Sadly the infuriating touch-sensitive steering wheel buttons, dropped from the rest of the Golf range, remain in the R. Outside of the on-board tech the Golf R’s cabin is a pleasant place to sit. You get comfortable yet figure-hugging sports seats and a chunky R-specific steering wheel with larger shift paddles, while space and storage are decent. The Volkswagen Golf R is so capable, and so fun to drive, it’s worth getting up early to enjoy some empty roads Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer You get some nice sporty touches, such as a suede-like material on the doors and seats, blue stitching and R-specific displays, but on the whole the cabin doesn’t feel quite up to the quality of other circa-£45k hot hatches such as the Audi S3. The Golf R loses out a little to alternatives in the practicality stakes, with only the S3 having a smaller boot capacity. At 341 litres the Golf R’s boot will be fine for most, but a Honda Civic Type R should be top of your shopping list of boot capacity is important. There’s also the Golf R Estate if you want more space. While there are a few pros and cons in terms of practicality and technology, there’s very little to complain about once on the road. The Golf R is one of the most engaging hot hatches to drive and its all-wheel drive system contributes to it being an incredibly capable car in corners. There’s loads of grip, and with all that power you shoot out of corners full of confidence. Importantly, it’s also more fun to drive than its predecessor. The fun factor is helped a bit by the extra power on offer. The 2.0-litre engine makes 333hp, up from 320hp, and has an official 0-62mph time of 4.6 seconds. However, we matched this in damp conditions, demonstrating how rapid this family hatchback really is. There are some compromises, with the suspension being a bit less comfortable than a regular Golf when driving around town, and you get more road noise at motorway speeds, too. These feel like fair concessions for a car that’s so good on a twisty stretch of Tarmac. If you’re looking for a new hot hatch, check out the latest Volkswagen Golf R deals on Carwow. You can also get a great price on a used Golf R, as well as other used Volkswagens, from our network of trusted dealers.

volkswagen,general,"Is the Volkswagen Golf GTI a good car? A staple in the world of the hot hatchback, the venerable Volkswagen Golf GTI was one of the first of the breed - and one of the best too. It’s been a shining example of a car that can do it all for decades, blending every day sensibility with usable performance in a sporty package. Think of the Golf GTI as a husky in sheep’s clothing, rather than a wolf. It looks unassuming to most people, but when you engage the Golf’s sporty driving modes and point it at a nice road it’ll chase down more powerful cars without ever feeling scary. The game has moved on though, and the Golf GTI has some serious hot hatchback competition these days. From the hardcore Honda Civic Type R and pocket rocket Toyota GR Yaris to the uber rapid - but uber expensive - Audi RS3 and Mercedes A35, the Golf GTI seems a little…mild. Even its own Golf R sibling has the GTI licked for outright pace and cornering grip. A 2024 update came to the Golf GTI’s rescue though, bringing with it the introduction of the latest GTI Clubsport model - which sits above the regular GTI with more power, sportier driving modes and dartier steering. It feels like what the Golf GTI should have been all along, but we’ll come back to that. The update saw the GTI gain some sportier bodywork and posher lights, though the illuminated badge is something the Golf could have done without; a bit chintzy for an otherwise classy car. It’s a handsome thing, if not exciting, but it does look purposeful in an ‘if you know you know’ kinda way. Inside is a similar story, with the classy, high-quality Golf interior spruced up just a touch with splashes of red trim, red ambient lighting and a GTI-specific steering wheel. While the current generation of Golf was launched in 2020 with one of the worst infotainment systems we’ve seen in recent years, the updated system is a comparative joy to use. Dashboard shortcut buttons would still be appreciated, but Volkswagen ditching the infuriating touch-sensitive steering wheel controls is a huge win. As a warmed-up daily driver the Golf GTI is excellent, but you need the Clubsport version for a proper hot hatch Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer There’s good space in the cabin and the seats are supportive, though rear legroom can be a little tight for tall passengers; fixed front headrests can induce neck ache for short passengers on long drives too. The 374-litre boot is smaller than some alternatives but it’s a useful shape and plenty big enough for four hand-luggage sized suitcases. As has been the way with Golf GTIs for decades, it’s one of the most refined hot hatchbacks you can buy. It’s comfortable around town, even in Clubsport trim, and while it’s notably stiffer than a regular Golf over bumps you’re rarely ever left wincing through potholes. Motorways are fantastic in the GTI with little in the way of wind noise and well-behaved driver assistance systems. Road noise is a bit too loud in the Clubsport though, especially over rougher motorway sections, though it’s never unbearable. B-roads should be where the GTI feels most at home, but sadly Volkswagen’s engineers have been a little too sensible when setting up the hot hatch. It’s never unsettled by bumpy corners and it feels fairly agile, but it’s just a little… numb. The Clubsport, again, remedies that to a certain extent. It’s much more direct than the standard car, with the wheels eagerly following your steering input and the car rotating well when carving through corners. It just feels a bit more old-school, and fun as a result, but while it’s a big improvement on the GTI it’s still some way off the Civic Type R. As a comfortable all rounder the GTI is a solid choice, so you should have a look at the latest Volkswagen Golf GTI deals on Carwow to get a great price on one.

volkswagen,general,"Is the Volkswagen T-Roc a good car? The Volkswagen T-Roc is a bit like a Stanley cup - it’s slightly posh, pretty expensive and incredibly popular. Volkswagen sells almost as many T-Rocs as it does Golfs, so chances are if you’re looking for a small SUV, you’ve got a T-Roc shortlisted. Luckily this Volkswagen does have quite a lot to recommend it. It’s practical, pretty good to drive, and has the enduring appeal of the Volkswagen badge. The T-Roc sits between the T-Cross and the Tiguan in Volkswagen’s range of SUVs. It’s more stylish than the boxy T-Cross, and as well as the standard SUV can be had as the hot T-Roc R or the interesting T-Roc Convertible, both of which we’ve reviewed separately. It was launched in 2017 and underwent a pretty hefty facelift in 2022. If you’re in the market for a small SUV, the T-Roc is just one of many cars you might be considering - and impressive alternatives include cars like the Peugeot 2008, Skoda Kamiq, and Ford Puma. The T-Roc may not be particularly glitzy on the outside, but it’s stylish in a solid, classy way - and that continues on the inside, with an interior that’s more function over form but still operates well and feels quite good to sit in. The T-Roc is a good all-round family car, but it’s beginning to feel a bit old hat next to more modern alternatives Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Space is decent; though the back seats are only average, you do get a very big boot. Big rear doors make it excellent for child seats, too, and the T-Roc did score five stars in Euro NCAP’s crash-testing which is reassuring if it’s going to be used as a family car. It’s pretty well-equipped as standard, too. Even entry-level cars get an 8.0-inch touchscreen that’s easy to use with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto as standard, plus a digital driver’s display, climate control, all-round parking sensors and some smart storage solutions. You do, however, pay handsomely if you want to move up the model range. The basic Life trim isn’t too expensive, but if you want the posher R-Line car with a more powerful engine the price jumps up quite a lot. With a few optional extras you can easily push the price over £40,000 - you can get a really nice BMW X1 M Sport for that sort of money. The T-Roc does drive quite well for a small SUV, though. None of the engines have any hybrid or electric trickery, but that keeps the overall weight low - and that means it corners nicely and feels light on its feet around town. The engine range is good too, and there is even a diesel option and four-wheel drive available - both increasingly rare among compact SUVs. At the entry level, there’s a 1.0-litre petrol with just 115hp which feels a bit sluggish. The 1.5-litre petrol with 150hp is probably the best all-rounder, with manual or automatic gearboxes available - while the 200hp 2.0-litre petrol is somewhat overkill. The diesels are great for very long-distance drivers, with miserly fuel consumption, but you won’t get the best from them around town. If you like what you hear you can see how much you could save with Carwow’s Volkswagen T-Roc deals.

volkswagen,general,"Is the Volkswagen T-Cross a good car? The Volkswagen T-Cross is a small SUV that’s among the best in its class. If you’re a couple or a small family and you have your heart set on an SUV, then the T-Cross is a car you should be shortlisting - it drives like a hatchback, has the practicality of a mini-MPV, feels better inside than many premium models yet it’s one of the cheapest cars Volkswagen sells. The T-Cross definitely punches above its weight, then. It’s a bit like a roast chicken dinner - not flashy, not complicated, but still excellent and hits the spot most of the time. The T-Cross is based on the same underpinnings as the VW Polo hatchback, and isn’t much bigger in terms of its footprint. That means it has tons of similarly-sized SUV alternatives - from the mechanically-related SEAT Arona, to the sporty Ford Puma and the plush Peugeot 2008. Climb inside, and you’ll find the T-Cross has loads of room courtesy of its nice squared-off body. It’s one of the roomiest cars for its size, with space for six-footers to stretch out in the back especially with the neat sliding rear seat which allows you to balance legroom and luggage space. Front passengers are well treated too, and the T-Cross’ raised ride height lets you tower over most family hatchbacks for a great view out. There are so many small SUV options these days, but the Volkswagen T-Cross does at least stand out for its decent space and practicality, if not for being the most inspired choice Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer An update in 2024 improved the interior finish of the T-Cross. While older cars felt decidedly cheap and plasticky, the newer model has much nicer materials, particularly across the face of the dashboard and on the door cards where your arm rests. It also improved the technology, tidied up the trim levels, and crowd-sourced the name for the bright yellow paint (Rubber Ducky Yellow - brilliant). It also removed the very sensible physical climate controls for an awkward touch-sensitive panel, though, so it’s not all positive change. In contrast to lots of other small SUVs, you won’t find a hybrid option or a fully-electric version of the Volkswagen T-Cross. Three engines are available - a 1.0-litre petrol with 95hp or 110hp, or a more powerful 1.5-litre with 150hp. Of these, we reckon it’s the middle engine that’s by far the best - it’s powerful enough, very efficient and can be had with manual or automatic gearboxes. Regardless of engine, the T-Cross is a competent car to drive. It’s not fun like a Ford Puma, and a Citroen C3 Aircross irons out the bumps more effectively, but the little VW feels solid, reassuring and stable. Combined with a refined interior and nicely supportive seats it’s a great little SUV to cover long distances in.

volkswagen,general,"Is the Volkswagen Polo a good car? Much like a designer sofa, the Volkswagen Polo takes an everyday item and puts a posh spin on it. It’s comfortable and has a bit more pedigree than its alternatives; while other small hatchbacks are more fun to drive, the Polo is the one you’d rather be seen in. Not that it’s the best of the bunch, because there are plenty of great hatchbacks on sale such as the Renault Clio and Peugeot 208, or electric and hybrid alternatives such as the Renault 5 and Toyota Yaris. It’s a smart looking thing, if not particularly exciting. There are loads of sharp lines around the small hatchback, with funky creases running down the Polo’s flanks, and intricately detailed LED lights on the front and back. It’s definitely more stately than sporty, and there’s more than a whiff of ‘honey I shrunk the Volkswagen Golf’ about it. Though when you sit inside, it feels anything but small. It’s more spacious than a lot of cars this size, with a wide dashboard and a glossy trim that wraps around onto the door cards. Material quality is high, with loads of soft-touch plastics and only a few scratchier surfaces lower down in the cabin. Unfortunately it is a little dour inside, as the only colours you can choose from are black and dark grey. Boo. It’s posh, comfortable and roomier than you might expect, just don’t expect any driving thrills from the Volkswagen Polo Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The Polo is easy to get comfortable in thanks to its highly adjustable front seats and steering wheel. There’s plenty of space in the back with enough headroom and legroom for rear passengers to remain comfortable on long drives - no mean feat in a small hatchback. You get a good amount of standard kit in the Volkswagen Polo, such as a swish digital driver display and an Apple CarPlay/Android Auto-enabled touchscreen infotainment screen in the dashboard. The lack of physical shortcut buttons means it can be a pain to use on the move though, and its glossy screen is a magnet for finger prints. There are no diesel options available for the Polo, just a 1.0-litre three-cylinder petrol engine with a few different power outputs. The entry level 80hp model is fine for pottering around town, but you’ll want the 95hp or 115hp version if you regularly travel on the motorway or on country lanes. Regardless of which engine you chose, the Polo is a comfortable car in town. It does a great job of absorbing lumps and bumps in the road, but its soft suspension means it doesn’t feel particularly agile on a country lane. Motorways are a breeze too, but it’s a shame you can only have a manual model with a five-speed gearbox as you do get a bit more engine noise and a bit less efficiency than you would with an extra gear. If B-road bashing is important to you then the Volkswagen Polo GTI (which we’ve reviewed separately) might be the best choice, with a much more powerful 2.0-litre turbocharged engine and stiffer, sportier suspension. Have a look at Volkswagen Polo deals on Carwow, or Polo lease deals for an alternative way to get behind the wheel of this posh little hatchback. You can also check out used Volkswagen Polos from our trusted dealer network, as well as other used Volkswagens if you’re open to a bigger car.

volkswagen,general,"Is the Volkswagen Polo GTI a good car? The Volkswagen Polo GTI is a small family car that’s practical, well built and fast enough to keep up with some sports cars on a tight country road. In this respect, it’s a bit more like a retired greyhound than the yappy, terrier-like Ford Fiesta ST. It might spend most of its time sleeping on your slippers in front of the fire, but it’s still happy to show other dogs a clean pair of heels (or paws) playing fetch in the park. Sadly, this tempting combination doesn’t come cheap, but at least the VW Polo GTI’s upmarket interior helps justify its price tag. Its cabin shares most of its trim with the already pretty posh Polo so it feels more special than a Fiesta ST. You get a pair of very supportive sports seats (upholstered in VW’s signature GTI tartan), shiny red inserts and a digital instrument panel is now standard, following a 2021 revision. Thankfully, these sporty additions haven’t made the VW Polo GTI any less easy to live with than the standard Polo – it’s still one of the most spacious and practical small cars around. There’s loads of adjustment to help you get comfy in the front seats and enough room in the back for six-foot-tall adults to sit behind an equally tall driver. Watch: Hyundai i20 N v Ford Fiesta ST v VW Polo GTI The VW Polo GTI’s practicality is streets ahead of the competition. There’s significantly more space in the boot than you get in the Ford Fiesta ST or Mini Cooper S and it feels more comfortable and more grown-up than these cars around town, too. It’s easy to drive and – with the optional adaptive suspension fitted – it soaks up bumps and potholes impressively well for a small hot hatch, which you would usually expect to be quite bouncy. Head out onto an empty country road and the VW Polo GTI’s powerful 2.0-litre turbocharged petrol engine and boisterous exhaust noise certainly help it stand out. That 2021 update gave the Polo GTI more power than before — 207hp — meaning it’ll sprint from 0-62mph in 6.5 seconds and its sporty suspension helps it feel stable at speed and grip keenly in tight corners. You can pretty much have your cake and eat it with the VW Polo GTI – it’s quick, very well built and practical enough to live with every day Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer It might not be quite as agile as the smaller Ford Fiesta ST but driving the VW Polo GTI is more relaxing for long periods and it’s quieter at motorway speeds – especially now that radar-guided cruise control comes as standard. You even get an automatic DSG gearbox as standard in all VW Polo GTIs, so you can rest easy knowing the car provides hot-hatch thrills in a more mature package than any other alternative. See how much you can save on your next car by visiting our VW Polo GTI deals page, or check out all our latest Volskwagen deals.

renault,general,"Is the Renault Clio a good car? If you’re looking for an affordable city car, but don’t want to sacrifice on style and practicality, the Renault Clio is an excellent option. It looks great inside and out and has a bigger boot than any of its small hatchback alternatives – so it’s good looking and practical, like a supermodel wearing cargo pants. And a little nip and tuck for 2023 means it looks better than ever, with similar chic appeal to the Peugeot 208, making the pair stand out from the likes of the Ford Fiesta, Volkswagen Polo and Vauxhall Corsa. But it's so much cheaper than the 208 that it represents fantastic value - earning it a Highly Commended spot in the Smart Spender category of the 2025 Carwow Car of the Year Awards. It’s up front where it’s really eye-catching now, with slim headlights and funky vertical daytime running lights flanking a new grille and prominent Renault logo. Round the back the new look is less obvious, but a tweaked bumper helps make the Clio look much more interesting. It’s a similar story inside, with the profile-orientated infotainment display (on top-spec models) and new climate control buttons giving off a more premium feel than before. And while some scratchy plastics lower in the cabin betray the car’s price, there are plenty of soft surfaces that are suitably upmarket. For a small car, it’s not at all cramped in the front, but those in the back will struggle for kneeroom in particular. Storage is fine wherever you sit, but you’ll want to leave most things in the cavernous boot – at 391 litres it’s more spacious than any alternatives' boots. The Renault Clio is up there with the very best small cars, thanks to its stylish looks and massive boot Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer A hybrid engine gives the Renault a head start on other options, too. The Honda Jazz and Toyota Yaris are just about your only other choices for small car electrification. There’s a regular petrol engine in the Clio too, which brings the price down and is appealing for those on a budget. Out on the road the hybrid works well, with the electric motor offering instant response at lower speeds and helping to keep fuel costs low. The petrol engine can get a bit noisy when accelerating up to motorway speeds, but settles down nicely once you get there. That said, the Volkswagen Polo is a quieter and more refined small car to drive. There’s a bit more tyre roar at high speeds in the Clio, and it’s more easily ruffled by bumps in the road. It shouldn’t be enough to put you off though, and with its appealing mix of style and practicality, the Renault Clio is a car you can shortlist with your heart as well as your head – especially considering it’s also one of the more affordable options. See how much you could save by browsing Renault Clio deals on Carwow, or get a great price on a used Clio.

renault,general,"Is the Renault 5 E-Tech a good car? The Renault 5 is an all-electric reinvention of an iconic hatchback. It’s good value for money, looks great inside and out, and it’s fun to drive – but being a small, city-friendly electric car, it’s not particularly practical. It’s a bit like finding one of your old football shirts from when you were a kid – the retro charm is very on-trend, but you might have to squeeze to fit in… There are other small electric cars to consider, none of which have particularly cavernous cabins. The Citroen e-C3 and Hyundai Inster are the obvious alternatives, but there’s also the slightly bigger, slightly more expensive BYD Dolphin. Beauty might be in the eye of the beholder but it’s hard to argue that the Renault 5 looks anything other than absolutely fantastic. Its small dimensions, boxy shape and retro look are all inspired by the ‘70s model of the same name, just with a modern spin. There are some cool details, from the broken square daytime running lights (a nod to the original) to the illuminated ‘5’ logo on the bonnet that indicates your battery charge. Renault 5: electric range, battery and charging data Range: 192 - 252 milesEfficiency: 4.1 - 4.3 miles per kWhBattery size: 40kWh / 50kWhMax charge speed: 80kW / 100kWCharge time AC: 3h 59m - 4h 51m 0 - 100%, 11kWhCharge time DC: 30 - 31m, 15 - 80%, 80-100kWhCharge port location: Right side frontPower outputs: 120hp / 150hp It’s really cool inside, too. The air vents mimic the headlight design and the dashboard ahead of the passenger has fabric, recycled denim or synthetic upholstery, depending on your trim, which looks great. There are some quirky colour combinations to be had, too. Renault has resisted the urge to plaster massive screens in a small car, so the driver display and infotainment are integrated nicely within a single housing. They’re big enough, with blocky graphics that are easy to use on the move. Snappy loading between menus and physical climate controls are further plus points, and Google software means it has useful apps built-in. Entry-level cars get a smaller driver’s display, though. As you might expect of a car this size, it’s not the most practical cabin. Space in the front is okay, especially for the passenger, but taller drivers might find the space beneath the steering wheel a bit tight. The back seats are a touch cramped, too. The flip side of this is the boot, which is an impressive 326 litres – that’s more capacity than you get in both the Mini Cooper Electric and Citroen e-C3. Retro charm makes the Renault 5 mighty appealing, but being great to drive means its beauty isn’t just skin deep Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer There are two battery options, the smaller one returning up to 190 miles and the larger one offering up to 250 miles, the latter also coming with a more powerful electric motor. That’s about par for the course for small EVs, as the e-C3 gets up to 199 miles between charges, while the Inster has between 203 and 229 miles, depending on the model. Naturally, the Renault 5 is most at home in the city, where its small dimensions and punchy electric motors make it ideal for nipping about in tight, busy urban areas, even if the suspension is a bit stiff, making you aware of small bumps in the road. These attributes also combine to create a car that’s great fun on a twisty road. Because it’s small it’s ideal for narrow strips of Tarmac in the British countryside, and the sharp steering and lack of body roll make it great fun in corners. It’s a bit noisy at motorway speeds, but no more than the Citroen and Hyundai. All in all, the Renault 5 is a fantastic little electric car. It’s oozing charm, and will put a smile on your face every time you drive it – just don’t expect all-round family car practicality. If that sounds ideal for your needs, check out the latest Renault 5 deals on Carwow, as well as Renault 5 leasing deals. You can also browse used Renaults from our network of trusted dealers, and when it’s time to sell your current car, Carwow can help with that, too.",,Carwow
renault,general,"Is the Renault Symbioz a good car? The Renault Symbioz is a bit like a Renault Captur that’s been out and got bum implants. From the front, you’d never know the two cars were different - the only changes come when you go round the rear, where the Symbioz has a longer body and a bigger boot. In many ways it’s sort of like an estate version of the Captur - like a Volkswagen Golf Estate is to a regular Golf hatchback. It’s aimed at people who like the Captur but want more space inside, and who can’t quite stretch up to the pricier, posher Renault Austral. Though it’s a little smaller, it provides an interesting alternative to super-popular family SUVs such as the Nissan Qashqai, Kia Sportage or Skoda Karoq. We’re not kidding when we tell you the Symbioz looks like a Captur. In fact, take the two cars in the same colour and from the front doors forwards, you’ll be hard-pressed to notice any changes at all. They’re limited to a couple of chrome flashes in the lower bumper line for the Symbioz, a slightly different pattern to the grille, and some alternative alloy wheel designs. The changes come from the rear doors backwards, where the Symbioz has a longer body with a bigger rear overhang to make more room for a big boot. The roofline and rear windows have been altered to accommodate this, and there’s a slightly more chiselled pattern on the rear doors. The interior's very similar too. The dashboards are identical, and feature a Google-powered infotainment system that's a pleasure to use. One feature the Symbioz has over the Captur is its stunning 'Solarbay' glass roof - this eschews a traditional blind for electrochromic glass which can become opaque at the touch of a button. Very fancy. The Symbioz is basically a Captur estate, but that’s no bad thing - it has a big boot and fantastic fuel economy. A Qashqai is nicer to drive, though Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The Symbioz has a 492-litre boot, which is quite a bit larger than the 348-litre boot you get on a hybrid Captur (the plain petrol Captur has 422 litres of space). That’s a little less room than the 504-litre Nissan Qashqai, 521-litre Skoda Karoq or 587-litre Kia Sportage, but impressive for what’s still quite a small car overall. The Symbioz is being pitched as a slightly more premium offering to the Captur, too. That means you don’t get a base-spec ‘Evolution’ trim level, nor can you specify the Captur’s 90hp petrol engine and manual gearbox. All Symbioz models come with Renault’s E-Tech hybrid system, which is super-efficient, promising over 60mpg if driven carefully. It’s a little clunky, though, thanks to its complicated gearbox, and that’s mirrored in the suspension which can feel quite firm when you’re driving round town at low speeds. In most scenarios, though, the Symbioz is perfectly fine to drive - though the extra weight does mean a Captur is more enjoyable. Interested?

renault,general,"Is the Renault Megane E-Tech a good car? If you’re looking for a stylish electric hatchback, the Renault Megane E-Tech is one worth considering. It’s the sort of car to be looking at if you’re considering an electric hatchback such as the Volkswagen ID3, Cupra Born or MG4 EV. This Megane is like one of your mates who’s suddenly decided to take on a vegan, eco-conscious lifestyle. Gone are its petrol versions, with just electric power coming in its place, plus a bunch of eco-friendly materials. But more on those shortly. There’s no questioning that the Renault Megane E-Tech Electric is a looker. A striking front-end design, sleek roofline and strong selection of two-tone colour choices certainly allow it to stand out. You’ll get 18-inch wheels as standard, but there’s a set of optional 20-inch alloys if those aren’t large enough for you. It’s just as stylish inside, too. You’re met immediately with a two-spoke steering wheel that offers something of a throwback feel (if you look beyond all the buttons), plus a host of recycled fabrics that look and feel the part. You can go for leather on top-spec cars, though. Renault Megane E-Tech: Electric range, battery and charging data Range: 280 milesEfficiency: 3.9 miles per kWhBattery size: 60kWhMax charge speed: 130kWCharge time AC: 9hrs 11mins, 0-100% at 7kWCharge time DC: 1hr 14mins, 0-80% at 130kWCharge port location: Right frontPower outputs: 215hp Directly in your line of vision is a 12.3-inch digital driver’s display that’s crisp and very configurable. To the side of that, you’ll find a portrait-set infotainment system that serves as evidence car manufacturers should bin off developing their own software and leave it to tech companies. This isn’t a dig at Renault, as it uses a new Google-based system here in the Megane. It’s super-sharp, dead easy to use and comes with impressive Google Maps integration without charging you any extra for the privilege. It helps that the assistant for voice controls is easy to use and rarely mishears you, too. However, the Megane is let down a little in the practicality stakes. Its roofline helps the design, but it does mean headroom in the back isn’t great, although there’s a good amount of knee room. The Renault’s boot comes in at a healthy 440 litres, which is comfortably more than the VW ID3’s 385 litres. However, it’s hindered by a massive lip that can make loading difficult — and storing the charging cables under the boot floor will mean playing real-life Tetris every time you want to charge while carrying a full load. The Megane comes with just the one power output, giving a 220hp instant surge of torque. It comes with a 60kWh battery, which offers 292 claimed miles between charges. In other markets there is also a cheaper and lower-powered 130hp version with a choice of battery sizes, but this isn’t offered in the UK. As all get the same 220hp motor setup, choose between the Techno or Iconic trim to get the best out of your Megane Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Hook it up to a 130kW rapid charger you’ll be able to complete a full charge in a little over 70 minutes. A 7.4kW home wall box charger will take just over 9 hours. Around town, the Megane’s light and direct steering make zipping around a breeze. That said, massive pillars at the front and a narrow rear window result in pretty poor visibility. You can have a rear-view camera displayed on the mirror to help the latter issue, but it’ll cost you. Take it out on the motorway and its soft-set suspension results in a smooth ride, though this combined with light steering does detract from your ability to have fun on twisty roads. So if you’re looking to add some style and sustainability to your driveway, the Renault Megane E-Tech should have a place on your shortlist. Head on over to our Renault deals page to see how much you can save on a Megane E-Tech when you buy through carwow.

renault,general,"Is the Renault Austral a good car? The Renault Austral is one of many mid-sized SUVs vying for your attention, making it an alternative to the likes of the Nissan Qashqai, Hyundai Tucson, Kia Sportage, Peugeot 3008 and Volkswagen Tiguan - to name a few. With impressive options available everywhere you turn, the Renault Austral attempts to stand out with a few key features - a really posh interior, great software, and a trick hybrid system which gives this medium-sized family car fuel economy to rival many a small hatchback. It’s like shopping at a designer outlet store - you can feel like you’re living the high life for less money than you expect, but it doesn’t come without compromise. The Austral is a smart-looking SUV, with its fairly square silhouette tempered by rounded corners and some distinctive styling features. The bold headlights, large grille and huge Renault badge mean you won’t mistake it for anything else, while the rear gets similarly wide taillights (though not a full-width light bar) and a sporty-looking diffuser on the bumper. The interior is similarly stylish, with a large portrait touchscreen canted towards the driver for a really focused, cockpit-like feel. There’s even a handrest in the middle that feels like an aircraft throttle, though this actually contains a wireless charging pad and hides a storage cubby underneath it. That central touchscreen runs a fantastic Google-based infotainment system. This means that not only is it swift and responsive, but it has native support for Google apps - including the best maps in the business, and other useful touches like music streaming services baked right in. While the Austral does feature smartphone mirroring tech, if you’re already using Google services you might not find that you need it here. The Renault Austral makes for a practical family car with some cool features, but the suspension's too firm Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer While the Austral’s interior punches above its price tag, the space inside is only average. A Skoda Karoq does have more rear-seat space, and more flexible arrangements for the boot. While the Austral has a sliding rear seat, you need it pushed all the way back to fit people in - at which point you only have a 430-litre boot, which is among the smallest of all the alternatives. A Nissan Qashqai, Kia Sportage and Skoda Karoq are all larger. Renault offers the Austral with just one engine - a complex hybrid arrangement using a 1.2-litre petrol engine and a pair of electric motors. It’s fiendishly complicated and shuffles the power about in ways that don’t always seem logical. The result can feel quite clunky if you accelerate hard or are trying to hustle down a back road, but it’s perfectly smooth when you’re driving sensibly - and means this relatively large SUV can easily return over 50mpg. The driving experience is a lot like the rest of the car - it has its good moments and bad. The steering is nice and accurate, and the Austral is comfortable on a long trip - but the firm suspension means it clatters over bumps at low speeds around town, making small potholes and bumps feel much larger than they are. At launch, the Renault Austral was offered with a cool four-wheel steering system which made it incredibly manoeuvrable around town. However, as of 2024, this is no longer offered If you want a great price for this family-friendly SUV, check out our best Renault Austral deals on Carwow here.

renault,general,"Is the Renault Captur a good car? The market is awash with small SUVs these days, meaning it takes a lot to stand out. If you’re looking for such a car with a bit of Parisian flair, the Renault Captur could be right down your alley. It’s a slightly more stylish alternative to cars like the Toyota Yaris Cross and Skoda Kamiq. It’s like comparing Nutella on toast to a freshly-baked pain au chocolat - both make for a great breakfast, but the latter looks more attractive and tastes better. The Captur was given a mid-life update in 2024 which brought a new face inspired by the Scenic E-Tech. It has arrow-shaped LED daytime running lights and redesigned bumpers, as well as a range of new alloy wheel designs. Step inside and you’re greeted with some interior upgrades as well. The rotary climate controls were ditched in favour of a neat row of toggle switches, and there’s no leather or chrome used inside to make it more eco-friendly. The biggest change though is the new Google-based infotainment system. All but the entry-level car get this and it’s really easy to use. You get Google Maps built in, as well as wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto to make it easy to pair your phone. It’s controlled through a 10.4-inch touchscreen, something you also get on the basic car without the Google software. Everything you regularly touch feels plush and well-screwed together, and there are plenty of squidgy materials throughout the cabin. A Peugeot 2008 does feel slightly more posh, but there’s not much in it. One area where the Captur impresses is boot space, because it offers more load capacity than a lot of alternatives. There’s also plenty of space up front to get comfortable behind the wheel, and there’s decent legroom in the back. Rear headroom is a bit tight though, a Skoda Kamiq is better for carrying adults. With such stiff competition the Captur had to grow up fast, and thankfully it’s done just that both inside and out Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Another party trick the Captur boasts is the sliding rear seats. You can pull them all the way forward to expand the space from 484 litres to a whopping 616 litres, making it among the largest of any small SUV. You do lose 136 litres of space if you go for the hybrid model, making it slightly smaller than a Toyota Yaris Cross’s boot, but it’s still bigger than a Nissan Juke’s. As part of the Captur’s 2024 update Renault slimmed down the engine lineup, so there are now just two to choose from. You can either have a 90hp 1.0-litre petrol engine with a six-speed manual gearbox, or there’s the 1.6-litre petrol hybrid with 145hp. If you can stretch to it, spending the extra for the hybrid is well worth it. It can run on electric power alone around town to save fuel – at low speeds the engine only cuts in when absolutely necessary and it’s hardly noticeable when it does. What’s not so good in town is the firm suspension, which jiggles and bobs you around over every bump in the road. The Captur won’t thrill you on a country road, but that’s not why you buy a small SUV. That said, the Ford Puma can put a smile on your face through the bends. More importantly, the Renault has precise steering and minimal body roll, both of which inspire confidence. Overall, the Renault Captur draws you in with its stylish exterior and it offers a practical interior and great tech. It doesn’t drive quite as nicely as some of the best small SUVs thanks to the firm suspension, but it’ll still serve you well as a great all-rounder. If this sounds like your next small SUV, then head over to our Renault Captur deals pages to see how much you can save.

renault,general,"Is the Renault Scenic E-Tech a good car? The Renault Scenic has been resurrected, and this time it’s ditched the dowdy MPV body in favour of being a chic, modern electric SUV. It’s a bit like when Zac Efron dropped his floppy-haired Disney kid look in favour of the gym-obsessed heartthrob appearance he has today. And chic the Scenic must be to stand out, because there are dozens of similarly sized electric SUVs vying for a spot on your shopping list, such as the Skoda Elroq, Hyundai Ioniq 5 and Peugeot E-3008. There’s also the excellent Kia EV3, which is a bit smaller and cheaper, but well worth considering. The quick win goes to the Renault Scenic, because it really does look good. At the rear you get chunky tail lights that drop down at the sides and make the car look really wide, as well as a simple but effective bumper design. Up front there are slim headlights and a fake grille with a cool gradient effect. Renault Scenic E-Tech: electric range, battery and charging data Range: 260 miles - 379 milesEfficiency: 3.6 - 3.7mi/kWhBattery size: 60kWh / 87kWhMax charge speed: 130kW / 150kWCharge time AC: 9hrs 51mins, 0-100, 7.4kW / 13hrs, 0-100%, 7.4kWCharge time DC: 32mins, 15-80%, 130kW / 37mins, 15-80%, 150kWCharge port location: Right side frontPower outputs: 170hp / 220hp The interior isn’t as immediately striking as the exterior, but it has a simple but smart appearance and there are some nice colours and materials for the upholstery, while the infotainment system is slick and easy to use. However, there are plenty of cheap materials to be found. Fortunately this is made up for with practicality, because there’s loads of storage in the cabin, plenty of adjustability in the front seats and steering wheel, and a huge amount of space in the back that also makes it good for a child seat. The boot is a good size too – at 545 litres it’s bigger than most alternatives, including the Skoda Elroq. There’s no front boot like you get in the Hyundai Ioniq 5, either. There’s a lot to love about the Renault Scenic. It’s practical, goes a long way between charges and offers great value for money. It’s a touch disappointing to drive, though Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer It might be practical, but out on the road, the Renault Scenic is a touch disappointing to drive. It’s generally quite comfortable, but it can be a bit jiggly over bumps, particularly at lower speeds. Visibility isn’t great either, and the spongy brakes take some getting used to. Now, it’s not so bad in any of these areas that the Scenic is not worth considering, it just doesn’t really stand out in any area either. For day-to-day comfort, the Hyundai Ioniq 5 is tough to beat. There are two battery and motor combinations, with the entry level version offering a respectable range of 260 miles, while the larger (more expensive) battery can go up to 379 miles between charges, according to official figures – that makes it one of the longest-range electric cars on sale.

renault,general,"Is the Renault Rafale a good car? The Renault Rafale takes the ‘coupe SUV’ body style that has proved so popular with buyers of posh brands, and brings it into the mainstream. It’s a bit like buying designer clothes from TK Maxx because the style and quality is there but it just doesn't feel quite as fancy buying it off a rail. Its is-it-an-SUV-or-something-else design makes it an alternative to the likes of the Peugeot 408, Cupra Formentor and the Citroen C5 X. Whatever you want to call it, the Rafale is a stylish-looking thing. You get an upright front end with a large grille and sleek headlights. At the back the taillights are narrow in the middle before fanning out to the sides, giving the car a tall, imposing stance. It’s a similar story inside, with the cockpit rather wrapping around you in a sporty manner. You get a horizontal instrument binnacle ahead of you, and a large, vertical display for the maps and infotainment to the right. Both are quick to switch between menus and pretty easy to use. Materials are hit and miss though – it doesn’t feel cheap inside but it’s not particularly posh either. The seat upholstery on the top-spec Alpine model we sat in was particularly lovely, though. The Renault Rafale is stylish inside and out, but there are cheaper alternatives to consider Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer It’s pretty spacious too, particularly in the back seats where you get loads of leg and headroom, and there’s even good space for a third person to sit in the middle. Storage is fine, with large door bins being a positive, though the glovebox is small and the area under the armrest isn’t massive. Boot space is decent, with more capacity than you get in the Cupra Formentor and Peugeot 408, but a bit less than in the Citroen C5 X. You lose a little capacity if you go for the plug-in hybrid to make space for the batteries, but compared with equivalent plug-in versions the Renault wins against all those mentioned above. At launch, the Rafale is only available with a self-charging hybrid engine. It has 200hp and promises up to 60.1mpg. The plug-in hybrid is coming later and has 300hp – its favourable Benefit-in-Kind rate means it’s probably worth waiting for if you are a company car driver, and should offer excellent economy if you can keep its batteries charged up. We’ll update this review with driving impressions once we’ve been behind the wheel, but if you can’t wait that long you can find out how much you could save with Carwow’s Renault Rafale deals.

renault,general,"Is the Renault Twingo a good car? The Renault Twingo is the smallest car that Renault makes and it’s an alternative to other little city slickers, such as the Volkswagen Up, Toyota Aygo and Hyundai i10. However, if you’re familiar with previous generations of the Twingo, this is something very different. It was developed alongside the Smart ForFour, so this latest version is a rear-engined, rear-wheel drive car – a layout that has real benefits in terms of how much space the car has inside and how easy it is to drive around town. Mind you, there’s no sign of that revolutionary (for a city car) layout from the outside. That said, the car certainly looks very distinctive and, as with most little cars these days, there’s lots of scope for the owner to personalise their car. Everything from the colour of the paint to the alloy wheels can be tailored to your wishes, while you can also add on extra decals to make your car stand out. Inside, too, the contrasting colours and strong design inject a bit of fun into the experience. And, as long as you avoid the base model, you can add a few more touches of personalisation. One more clever touch is that Renault has an app that you can install on your smartphone. You then clip it into a cradle in the car, giving you an instant touchscreen, which you can use to control the sat-nav, phone and stereo. If you want a larger touchscreen, you can fit the optional R-Link system, which has an integrated 7.0-inch screen, through which you control the various parts of the infotainment system. Where the Renault Twingo really stands out from the alternatives is how much room it has inside. Four adults can fit with ease and getting in and out is not the contortionist’s feat it can be in some small cars. Mind you, the optional fabric sunroof reduces the available headroom quite significantly, so be sure that won’t be a problem before ticking that box. That excellent cabin space is thanks to having the engine at the back, but there are some compromises with that layout. Most obviously, as the engine sits below the boot floor, the boot capacity is only 188 litres, which is a little less than you’ll find in an Up, for example. When I read that the Twingo was going to be a small, rear-engined, rear-wheel car, I was really excited. Then I drove it. What a disappointment. Mat Watson Carwow expert You can increase this by putting the rear seat backs up to 90 degrees, which isn’t especially comfortable, but there’s also around 50 litres of storage dotted around in the cabin too in various pockets and bins. You can also fold the front passenger seat flat and the Renault Twingo will accept loads up to 2.3-metres long. The one thing that the rear-engined layout doesn’t do is to turn the Twingo into some sort of mini-Porsche 911 supercar, which famously shares the same arrangement. In fact, this doesn’t feel like a particularly sporty car to drive at all – but it’s not without its benefits. For example, with no engine at the front of the car, the nose feels a lot lighter. And, because the car is rear-wheel drive, the front wheels can turn further than in a front-wheel drive car, giving a very tight turning circle. As a result, the car is wonderfully easy to manoeuvre around town and get into the smallest parking spaces. However, on the open road, it’s not the most enjoyable little car to drive. In part, that’s because the stability control system is a little over-eager to get involved when the driver gets a little keener and starts to tackle bends a bit more quickly. Likewise, the Twingo isn’t the most comfortable little car, especially the models with larger wheels fitted. The VW Up and Hyundai i10 both have a more settled and more mature feel on the road. As is often the case with these small cars, there’s only a small range of engines to pick from. So, if you want a Twingo, you can only choose between two engines: a 1.0-litre unit with 70hp and a more powerful 0.9-litre turbo, with 90hp. The 1.0-litre unit is enough if you spend most of your time driving around town, but it’s worth going for the stronger unit if you plan on making longer journeys beyond the city limits. No matter where you’re heading, you’ll be pleased to know that the Renault Twingo has a reasonable four-star rating from Euro NCAP, which is pretty much identical to what you’ll find in most alternatives. Less happily, the Renault Twingo costs a bit more than the most obvious alternatives, but every model comes well equipped – with DAB radio, front electric windows, split folding rear seats, LED daytime running lights, a tyre pressure monitoring system and USB connectivity. Despite that high level of standard equipment and generous space for passengers, the Twingo is hard to recommend over the alternatives. It’s a little on the pricey side at the bottom end of the range and, while the more expensive models (with the stronger engine) make more sense, they cost as much as larger vehicles that offer far more space.",,Carwow
renault,general,"Is the Renault Megane a good car? This version of the Renault Megane first came on sale in 2016 but received a range of updates in 2018, including improvements to the infotainment system and more space for passengers. The Megane is similar in size to the Hyundai i30, Kia Ceed and Ford Focus, but also shares a lot of parts with the Renault Kadjar SUV. The Renault Megane’s interior looks simpler than in most alternatives so most of the buttons are easy to locate. High-spec models also get a portrait-style infotainment system, similar to what you’d find in more expensive Volvo cars. The rest of the cabin is well put together and has some silver accents to break up the otherwise all-black colour scheme. Getting a good driving position is easy even in the entry-level Renault Megane because they get height-adjustable front seats as standard. You can also set the seat nice and low for a sporty feel and front seat passenger space is good. Accessing the rear seats is easy thanks to wide-opening doors and you can fit two adults without much hassle – three would be a push, because the middle rear seat is narrower than the outer two. In terms of practicality, the Renault Megane’s boot is just about big enough for a week’s holiday worth of luggage and the opening is wide enough so you won’t have problems loading bulky items. However, some alternatives, such as the Kia Ceed, have a lower load lip making them even more practical. The Renault Megane won’t wow you with a sporty drive, but you’ll be impressed by how comfortable it is. Mat Watson Carwow expert There are two engines to choose from in the Renault Megane range so picking the right one is easy. The 140bhp petrol is hushed on the move and feels best darting around city streets. The 115bhp diesel is perfect for longer motorway journeys where it settles nicely into a cruise and uses very little fuel. Driving the Renault Megane feels best on the motorway. Once up to speed there’s little wind noise and the Megane absorbs bumps very well. That isn’t to say it’s not good around town – there, the quick steering helps you dart in and out of traffic with confidence, however the manual gear shift is notchy and not that pleasurable to use. No matter if you drive in town or on the motorway, the Renault Megane is a safe car. It was awarded the full five stars from EuroNCAP and, as standard, you get essentials such as airbags, an advanced stability control system and hill-hold assist. Mid-range models also get lane departure warning, traffic sign recognition and automatic high-low beam as standard.",,Carwow
renault,general,"Is the Renault Kadjar a good car? The Renault Kadjar is the French firm’s contender in the big-selling family SUV category. These cars sell in huge numbers these days because they’re more spacious than a conventional hatchback with a higher driving position, although they cost a bit more to run. Think of the Renault Kadjar as a Nissan Qashqai with a little more je ne sais quoi and you won’t go far wrong, because underneath it shares much of its running gear with the Japanese car. The Renault Kadjar looks a lot more imposing on the outside than a hatchback such as the VW Golf or Renault Megane. It comes with large alloy wheels, a smattering of chrome trim and plenty of contrasting black trim on the bumpers and wheel arches so it’ll have no trouble standing out on the school run. Sadly, the Renault Kadjar’s interior isn’t quite as eye-catching as that in some other SUVs. Sure, it has plenty of soft plastics and a few brushed metal trims, but the Kia Sportage looks more exciting while the VW Tiguan feels more solidly put together. It comes with a good deal of equipment though, you get a digital driver’s display as standard, alongside a touchscreen infotainment system. It all looks pretty flash, but using the built-in sat nav is a bit trickier than in alternatives – a bit like paying for something with cash rather than using your contactless bank card. You could be forgiven for thinking the Kadjar looks a bit like a Qashqai – they’re essentially the same car, although the Nissan is more comfortable and the Renault’s a bit roomier Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer At least you’ll be sitting comfortably while you fiddle with the Renault Kadjar’s touchscreen. You get plenty of seat and steering-wheel adjustment as standard and there’s enough space for you to stretch out if you’re tall. It’s a similar story in the back where there’s room for three adults, but you don’t get any clever sliding seats like in the Skoda Karoq. The boot’s roomy enough for everyone’s luggage, though, and the flat boot floor makes it easy to slide in heavy luggage. There’s a 138hp petrol engine which provides a good mix of performance and efficiency, and you can option it with an automatic transmission rather than the manual to help take the stress out of town driving. Whichever transmission you pick, you’ll find the Renault Kadjar is pretty comfortable to drive. It doesn’t quite iron out bumps as well as the Nissan Qashqai, but it’s more relaxing than the Kia Sportage and Hyundai Tucson and doesn’t lean a great deal in tight corners. Unfortunately, the Kadjar is a little noisy to drive at motorway speeds. This isn’t because of its engine, rather you’ll hear quite a lot of wind and tyre noise. To help make things a bit more relaxing, you can get it with a range of driver assistance systems from automatic emergency braking and cruise control to lane-departure warning. All this makes the Renault Kadjar pretty easy to live with every day. It’s certainly an SUV that’s well worth considering if you’re looking for something that’s easy to drive, practical and pretty well equipped. Head over to the deals page to find some great deals on a brand new SUV, and if you're wanting a used Renault Kadjar then we have a great range of second-hand ones to choose from.",,Carwow
renault,general,"Is the Renault Scenic a good car? Considering how boring the old model was, the new Renault Scenic makes for a welcome a dose of continental fresh air. It’s an imposing car to look at – it’s 20mm wider than the car it replaces and comes as standard with two-tone paint and blingy 20-inch alloy wheels that look, well, fantastic! Those looks couldn’t come at the expense of practicality, though, so the Renault has a big boot, cubbyholes and under-seat bins that provide 63 litres of storage and one of the most elaborate gloveboxes we have ever seen. The engine range is extensive, too. Buyers can choose from five diesels, two petrols and a diesel-electric hybrid that returns fuel economy of 80.4mpg. Petrols are manual only, but diesels are available with a six-speed manual or a dual-clutch auto with the same number of gears. All models come with emergency city braking that works at speed of up to 31mph and can detect people (a class first), cruise control, two Isofix child-seat mounting points, a height adjustable driver’s seat and a Bluetooth phone connection. If you like the look of an SUV, but don't need the high ride height, the Scenic is perfect for you Mat Watson Carwow expert The Renault Espace was arguably the first MPV ever made and that expertise shows in this new Scenic. There’s much to like here, not least its cheap running costs and practical interior. Sure, the VW Touran is better to drive and the Citroen C4 Picasso is more comfortable, but the Scenic – much like the Espace – offers something genuinely unique here – stylish looks that don’t punish you for needing a practical car.",,Carwow
renault,general,"Is the Renault Arkana a good car? If you fancy a sporty-looking coupe SUV, your only options used to be big, posh German cars like the BMW X4 and Mercedes GLC Coupe, but there are a couple of more reasonably-priced models out there now which offer similar sleek styling, one of these being the Renault Arkana. You can think of it as a slightly left-field alternative to cars such as the Skoda Karoq or the Nissan Qashqai. If those cars are a bowl of porridge for breakfast, the Arkana is more like a pain au chocolat. It may not be as sensible, but it’s a more exciting option. You may also be considering the Peugeot 408, which has bolder styling. The front end will be familiar from other Renaults thanks to the C-shaped LED running lights, and you get LED headlights on mid-spec cars and up. It’s the side profile that really sets the Arkana apart, with a swoopy coupe-esque roofline lending it a sporty edge over alternatives. This may look cool, however it doesn’t do much for interior space. While those up front won’t have any trouble getting comfortable, thanks to plenty of adjustment in the seats and steering wheel, the back seats aren't quite so accommodating. Headroom is pretty limited and there’s not much in the way of legroom either. A Skoda Karoq is a better bet for carrying people on a regular basis. It may not be the most practical cabin, but at least it's well made. There are plenty of plush materials to be found, and everything feels well screwed together. The metallic feeling dials for the climate control are a particularly welcome addition, however, the interior doesn’t have quite the same design flair as a Peugeot 408. At 480 litres, the boot is a decent size. It’s slightly bigger than a Peugeot 408 hybrid, but it’s a lot smaller than a Citroen C5 X and there are no clever features like a 12-volt socket or some hooks for your shopping bags. As for interior cubby spaces, you get an average glovebox and some large door pockets, but that’s pretty much it other than a pair of cupholders and a small cubby under the armrest. What the Arkana lacks in interior space, it more than makes up for in standard equipment Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer What the Arkana lacks in interior space, it makes up for in standard equipment. Even entry-level Evolution models get a 7.0-inch touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto and rear parking sensors with a reversing camera, but if you step up to the Techno model you get a better-looking 9.3-inch screen. As for engines, you have a choice of one. The Arkana comes only with a 1.6-litre full hybrid. If you’re after a diesel SUV, you’re out of luck here. Take a look at the Citroen C5 Aircross instead. The 145hp hybrid system should return a claimed 60mpg, however a week with the car in a mixture of driving conditions saw us return an average of 44mpg. Behind the wheel the Arkana isn’t as sporty to drive as the styling would suggest. A Ford Kuga will put a bigger smile on your face. The suspension is also quite firm, so driving on broken roads can become tiring. The Arkana is at its best on the motorway. It’s pretty smooth at speed, however the bigger wheels on the Esprit Alpine model do generate a bit of tyre noise. The Renault Arkana may not be the most practical SUV on the market, however, it’s still worth considering if you're after a sporty-looking SUV with plenty of standard equipment and a decent price tag.

renault,general,"Is the Renault Koleos a good car? The Renault Koleos SUV is basically the same underneath as the Nissan X-Trail. However, unlike the Nissan, which has the option of seven seats, the Renault comes only as a five-seater, making it an alternative to the Skoda Kodiaq, Ford Kuga and Honda CR-V. Unsurprisingly, the Koleos looks very like Renault’s other SUV, the smaller Kadjar, at the front, but with plenty of smarter trim and chrome to reflect its position higher in the company’s range. It’s a sensation that is continued inside, where the standard sunroof makes the cabin feel nice and airy. It’s all very smart, too, and the Koleos gets Renault’s R-LINK 2 infotainment system in either seven-inch landscape form or with an 8.7-inch portrait display. The latter comes as standard on top-of-the-range models and it’s pretty to look and simple to use, although you’ll sometimes find its directions hard to follow and it’s frustrating that you have to use it to make minor adjustments to the ventilation system. Interior quality is a mixed bag, too. Although there is stitched leather on the centre console’s grab handles, as well as shiny chrome trim pieces, the plastics look and feel cheaper than you would get in a Skoda Kodiaq. What’s not open to criticism is how much space there is inside the Koleos. As Renault hasn’t had to make room for a third row of seats, all five passengers are treated to acres of head and legroom. The small hump in the floor and wide rear seats means that, even with three in the back, everyone should be happy. The seats are all comfortable and, thanks to the wide range of adjustment on the driver’s seat and steering wheel, pretty much anyone can get a good driving position. Perhaps the biggest reason for choosing the Renault Koleos over the Kadjar is the size of the boot. Even with all five seats upright, the boot will take the best part of 600 litres, which is more than enough for most families. Drop the rear seats and you have almost 2,000 litres to play with. All very impressive… I just don’t get it. Why doesn’t Renault sell a Koleos with seven seats, like the Nissan X-Trail? With only five seats, this is just a bigger, more expensive Kadjar – and, if I was picking between the two, I’d always choose the cheaper car. Mat Watson Carwow expert With that in mind, it’s no surprise that the Koleos feels like a large car to drive, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing. Unless you’re in town, you’ll only feel the worst bumps, while it’s nice and quiet inside the cabin, even at high speeds. The suspension feels quite soft, as you would expect, but the body lean is reasonably well contained unless you’re cornering very quickly. Overall, though, a Skoda Kodiaq feels sharper to drive. There are just two engines to choose from – both diesel – and the more powerful 177hp 2.0-litre model comes as standard with four-wheel drive, a combination that actually makes the Koleos pretty handy off-road. Alternatively, to make life on-road a little easier, the same engine can also be specified with a CVT automatic gearbox that shifts smoothly and doesn’t cause the annoying drone you get in other gearboxes of this type. Overall, though, unless you want four-wheel drive or an automatic, the 130hp 1.6-litre diesel feels pretty much as quick as the more powerful engine in everyday use and should return close to 50mpg if driven carefully. For most people, it’ll be the best engine to choose, especially as it’s the cheaper option in a range that looks quite expensive. On the other hand, there is some justification for the high price, as the car comes with lots of equipment as standard. That includes a full-length glass roof, sat-nav, part-leather seats, ambient lighting and cup holders that can heat or cool drinks. Last, but not least, the car also scored a full five stars in Euro NCAP safety tests, which is just what any parent will want to see in a family car. Overall, the Koleos is worth considering if you want an extremely comfortable SUV with a big boot, but don’t need seven seats. Its off-road ability and generous standard equipment are further attractions, but some of the alternatives feel better built, are more fun to drive and give you the option to specify seven seats.",,Carwow
renault,general,"Is the Renault Zoe a good car? The Renault Zoe is a small electric car with a decent range that’s an alternative to models such as the Mini E and Peugeot e-208. The Zoe has been around for a while now, but gets regular updates, so it’s a bit like an iPhone in that it looks mostly unchanged year after year, yet contains the very latest technology. The current model’s latest updates include a few more air intakes than its predecessor – some of which help guide air past the front wheels to help reduce drag and maximise range – and a set of full-LED headlights. Renault has given the Zoe’s brake lights the LED treatment too; ditching the old car’s blue lens coating in the process. More exciting than this, however, is what lies inside. There’s a super-slick dashboard layout, a classy infotainment system and a digital driver’s display as standard. You can even get the dashboard trimmed in some whale-friendly recycled material made from old plastic bottles. EV Range Test: Honda e v Mini Electric v Peugeot e-208 v Renault Zoe v Vauxhall Corsa Electric v Volkswagen e-Up Thankfully, the Renault Zoe is really comfortable inside – in the front, at least. Those in the back will feel pretty hemmed-in if they’re close to six-feet tall and there isn’t enough shoulder room to carry three adults. Chances are, you won’t be using your dinky electric city car for lugging heavy loads. Rather, you’ll be nipping through rush-hour traffic – something the Zoe feels born to do. You get a good view forward thanks to its large windows, and the light controls make tight turns a doddle. The new Renault Zoe is capable of more than just trips to the shops, though. With its batteries fully brimmed – which takes three hours from empty using a public 22kW charger – you’ll be able to travel up to 239 miles. Charging at home using the standard 7 kWh setup will take just over nine hours. However, a 30-minute charge using a 50kW fast charger will give you 90 miles of range. This fast- charging feature is optional on the base trim and standard on the top version. The Renault Zoe doesn’t rely on gimmicks like some electric cars. Instead, it focuses on being affordable, having a good range and, being surprisingly fun to drive – for a small electric car Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer It’s pretty perky for a small car, too, so you’ll have no issue scooting away from junctions or overtaking sluggish lorries. That said, the Renault Zoe doesn’t make a particularly good motorway cruiser. Sure, its electric motor is much quieter than a petrol or diesel engine, but you’ll still hear a fair amount of wind and tyre noise at speed. You do at least get cruise control to make long journeys a bit more bearable. Another point to consider is the rather poor Euro NCAP retested safety rating it received in 2021. You shouldn’t let this put you off, though. The Renault Zoe is a very capable small electric car that comes with decent range and peppy performance, and recent updates mean you get a pretty impressive amount of standard kit, too. Just don’t go trying to carry tall adults in the back. Head over to our Renault Zoe deals page to see how much you can save or take a look at our used Renault Zoe deals.",,Carwow
peugeot,general,"Is the Peugeot 208 a good car? The latest Peugeot 208 is an extensive facelift of the second-generation car, first launched in 2019. The newest model brings the car’s styling right up to date and adds an in-vogue hybrid engine as a sort of halfway house between a pure petrol model and the all-electric E-208. What it doesn’t change is what’s great about the 208 - its sense of style, lovely interior and chuckable chassis which make it a pleasure to drive. In many ways the 208 is like the designer handbag of the small hatchback world - it’s not as practical as some of the alternatives, but it’s handsome, glamorous and feels good to own. There are some really strong options available as alternatives, though. The Renault Clio is just as good-looking and offers a huge boot, nice interior and super-efficient engines. The Toyota Yaris offers a ten-year-warranty and proven hybrid engine, and the Volkswagen Polo is solid, posh and with an unmatched image. The 208’s style stands out from the crowd. It’s small, with a squat stance and intricate detailing that makes it look really glitzy even as a low-spec model. The front is dominated by Peugeot’s distinctive ‘three-claw’ LED daytime running lights, the line of which continues up into the headlights - you get a similar effect at the rear. The new Peugeot badge sits on a grille with body-coloured flashes, and round the side you even get a shortened rear window line which is a call back to the iconic 205. Inside, the 208 is the equal of any premium car in terms of its quality and design. There’s a new 10.0-inch touchscreen sat high up, with a clear display, responsive interface and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto included as standard. Material quality is high throughout, and you can feel that on the soft-touch dashboard with a woven finish or the row of piano key-style switches above the gear lever. The Peugeot 208 is the first small car to offer petrol, diesel and electric options. If you have access to charging at home or work, the EV is a superb choice Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer It’s not particularly roomy, though. A Renault Clio has a much bigger boot than the 208’s 311 litres, and a Skoda Fabia is far better for accommodating rear passengers. Even the 208’s front seats aren’t the best for very tall drivers, which is a shame. You also get Peugeot’s unique i-Cockpit layout, which means the shrunken steering wheel sits low and you view the dials over the top of it, rather than through the rim. Though this is divisive, it can be very comfortable - and the tiny wheel makes the 208 feel darty and responsive to drive. There are three engine options available for the 208. The entry-level car comes with a 1.2-litre petrol engine with a six-speed manual gearbox, or you can have a 1.2-litre hybrid automatic in two power outputs. Whichever you choose, you can expect good efficiency and a really nice refined drive. The 208 is comfortable on the motorway, feels darty and nimble around town and can even be quite fun on a twisting back road. The challenge is that a Renault Clio is arguably the more fun car and has a wider breadth of talents, while a Toyota Yaris will be even cheaper to run. But the 208 doesn’t remotely embarrass itself out on the road. If the 208 catches your eye, then you can nab yourself one for a great price by looking at our best Peugeot 208 deals.

peugeot,general,"Is the Peugeot E-208 a good car? The Peugeot E-208 has had a facelift, updating the all-electric hatchback with a fresh look, a bigger battery and a more powerful electric motor. This makes it a much more competitive small EV, and much easier to consider against great electric cars such as the Mini Cooper Electric, the MG4 and the Cupra Born. An immediate plus point the E-208 has going for it is its size. It’s the same size as the regular petrol 208, so it’s quite a bit smaller than most EVs. If you want something nippy and compact, perfect for city driving, the E-208 is your best bet this side of a Fiat 500 Electric. Peugeot E-208: electric range, battery and charging data Range: 217 - 245 milesEfficiency: 4.3 - 4.5 mi/kWhBattery size: 50 - 54kWhMax charge speed: 100kWCharge time AC: 0 - 100% 7hr 45mCharge time DC: 20 - 80% 25mCharge port location: Rear leftPower outputs: 136 - 156hp It’s also quite sensible and pragmatic, despite its posh outward appearance and high-tech cabin. In that regard it’s a bit like putting a fancy phone case on your work phone - yes, it looks good, but it’s all business where it counts. For 2024 Peugeot upgraded the E-208’s exterior looks. But part of the appeal is that there’s very little to mark it out as an electric car - if you didn’t spot the green flash on the number plate or the discreet ‘E’ badging, you’d think it was just a regular petrol 208. It does look smart, though, with distinctive ‘triple-claw’ LED daytime running lights front and rear, smart diamond-cut alloy wheels and even a homage to the old Peugeot 205 in the shape of its rear window. That compact silhouette hides an interior that is a bit tighter than the class best. The rear seats are quite cramped, and even the front seats aren’t the best for very tall drivers. The boot, though quite roomy at 311 litres, can’t compete with larger cars of a similar price, such as the 363-litre MG4 EV and the 385-litre Cupra Born. The E-208 is at least much more roomy than the Mini Cooper Electric - and its dashboard has a similar wow factor, too. It’s beautifully built, with lots of squashy, high-quality materials, and the 10.0-inch touchscreen that sits on the top is clear, responsive and quite easy to use. Other nice touches include the row of piano-style keys underneath the screen, while Peugeot’s i-Cockpit dial layout is present and correct - though it still won’t suit everybody’s driving position. The E-208 is a great-looking small EV which is really efficient on its battery - but you can get bigger cars with a better range for less money Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer You get a choice of two battery and motor combos. The entry-level is the same one the E-208 was offered with at launch in 2019 - a 50kWh battery and 136hp electric motor. The newer variant of this has 54kWh and 156hp to play with - not a big boost, but huge improvements in efficiency mean this is by far the best option to select. To drive, the E-208 isn’t as rapid as an MG4 or a Cupra Born, and as a result it doesn’t feel too dissimilar to the regular petrol automatic 208. It’s great to drive in town thanks to compact dimensions and quick steering, though the aforementioned MG and Cupra are more entertaining to drive on a twisty road mainly thanks to their rear-wheel drive chassis.

peugeot,general,"Is the Peugeot 2008 a good car? The Peugeot 2008 is a small SUV with a bold look, comprising strong colour schemes and a variety of slashes and creases that make alternatives such as the Volkswagen T-Cross look more than a little tedious. If small SUVs are more rugged versions of small cars, then the Peugeot 2008 is a 208 that’s kitted out for a paintballing trip. It has the same great tech you get in the hatchback, but is better prepared for some countryside pursuits thanks to its raised ride height. And the French flair loses no momentum when you get inside, helped by a 2023 update that saw a 10.0-inch infotainment display fitted as standard. The digital driver's display (standard on all but the base model) that sits above the teeny tiny steering wheel looks great, and has a cool 3D-effect on top-spec models that works with the fancy dashboard design to offer a neat appearance that's tough to match at this price point. Not many do better than the Peugeot for front-seat room, either. It will easily accommodate two tall adults and there’s plenty of scope to move the seat and steering wheel, though lumbar adjustment – which helps keep you comfy on long drives – is only optional on top-spec versions. Back seat space is less impressive, though. Tall passengers will have their knees brushing the front seats if they’re sitting behind someone else who’s tall. On the upside, there is plenty of head and foot room. We think the best version of the Peugeot 2008 is the 130hp 1.2-litre petrol in GT trim, as it's stylish and the engine is well-suited to the family SUV Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer In the boot, the 2008 has 434 litres to work with, which is better than the Skoda Kamiq and Seat Arona, but falls short of the Volkswagen T-Cross and Ford Puma. Hit the road and you’ll find the 2008 is a great all-rounder. Its steering is light in town, but weights up to give you more confidence at faster speeds. The slick six-speed manual gearbox (top-spec models get an eight-speed automatic) is the perfect match for the Peugeot’s sporty small steering wheel, though that's where the sportiness ends. It's relatively fun on a winding road, but it's happier taking things easy. The most powerful engine helps make it a bit more enjoyable, though. It has 130hp and is both sprightly and cheap to run. The manual Allure version is a bit more economical than the automatic GT, but official figures make the entry level 100hp engine the cheapest to run. But what makes the 2008 stand out from alternatives is its eye-catching styling that proves cheap-to-run and practical family cars can still be desirable. For that reason alone, it’s worth shortlisting against cars like the Seat Arona and VW T-Cross. And, of course, the 2008 is available in fully electric E-2008 form. If you’re sold on the idea, check out the latest Peugeot 2008 deals on carwow, where you can also find a variety of used Peugeot 2008 models.

peugeot,general,"Is the Peugeot E-2008 a good car? If you want a small electric SUV that’s stylish inside and out without sacrificing comfort and practicality, the Peugeot E-2008 is worthy of a spot on your shortlist. The latest model can go a bit further between charges than before too. There are plenty of alternatives at the more affordable end of the electric SUV market, including the MG ZS EV, Volvo EX30 and Vauxhall Mokka Electric, for example. There’s also the Citroen e-C4 and Kia Niro EV, both of which have smart designs – but the E-2008’s chic, upmarket appeal has them all licked. It’s a bit like wearing a Hermès outfit on the catwalk, rather than something from a high street chain. Its fancy styling has some cool details, such as the claw-like running lights in the lower bumper that give it a unique face, while the front grille has upmarket body-coloured inserts on all but the lowest trim. At the back there are LED lights and the Peugeot name is scrawled across the bootlid. Hop inside and you’ll find the style taps are left to flow. A wraparound dashboard is a nice addition, plus there are plenty of high-quality materials used throughout. You’ll have to search hard for anything that feels properly cheap, and there's a big infotainment display that's a bit easier to use than the one in older models, but still not up there with the best. The digital driver’s display is bigger and better than before, too. However, Peugeot’s commitment to having the dials sit above the small wheel means that you’ll find the view of them blocked in some seating positions. Sounds like a minor point, but it’s worth giving it a go before committing to buying an E-2008. Unlike some electric cars which are built from the ground up as battery-powered cars, the E-2008 is based on the petrol-powered 2008. That, unfortunately, results in a hefty hump in the rear seats where you would find mechanical bits in that model, which middle-seat passengers will have to straddle. Those sat in the outer seats will also find kneeroom isn’t great, while taller drivers might find their hair brushes against the bit where the roof meets the door. Sure, the Peugeot E-2008 looks great inside and out, but we also love how comfortable it is compared with other electric SUVs Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer On the plus side, the boot has no load lip so it’s dead easy to get stuff in and out of, plus its square shape makes it easy to play cargo-loading Tetris. With 435 litres of space to use, it’s fairly good but not massive. The e-C4 and Mokka Electric have less, but the Niro EV can carry more stuff. Spend a bit more and you can have a Skoda Enyaq, which has a massive boot. An update in 2023 increased the E-2008's range from 217 miles to 250 miles, improving the old car's key weakness. That's a useful distance between charges, however, for the cash you can go further in the Kia and a similarly priced MG, while the Citroen and Vauxhall are getting the same battery upgrades as the Peugeot to offer similar range. As well as this single battery option, there’s just one motor option for the E-2008. It’s now 156hp, which is a bit more than before. However, despite having more power it’s very much designed to offer leisurely performance, even if you pop the car into its sportiest settings. Sportiness is not the E-2008’s raison d'etre, though. It can be quite fun to steer down a winding road, but it’s much happier cruising along the motorway or in town, where it soaks up bumps with little fuss. This is a very relaxing and comfortable electric SUV to drive. The Peugeot E-2008 is a real head-turner, and backs this up with a lovely interior, too. Rear seat space is limited and boot capacity is so-so, though the square space does make it more useful. The improved electric range is welcome, too, if still not quite up with the best you can get for this money. Interested?

peugeot,general,"Is the Peugeot 308 a good car? The Peugeot 308 could be right up your street if you want your next family hatchback to really stand out in a sea of restrained-looking alternatives such as the VW Golf and Ford Focus. It's like taking all your practical work clothes and updating them with sparkly accessories. Just take a look at that front end. It looks like Peugeot’s taken the 308 and dipped it face-first in a bucket of leftover Christmas decorations. Shiny daytime chrome, bright running lights and LED lamps are everywhere, along with a brand-new shield-shaped Peugeot badge. Somehow, though, these bits of car jewellery work together to make the 308 look more upmarket than most other small family hatches, such as the Skoda Octavia or SEAT Leon. It’s a similar story at the back, where Peugeot has added some bright red brake-light slashes to the bootlid and a set of shiny chrome exhaust trims to the bumper. Although, peer closer and those square pipes are just plastic add-ons. Thankfully, there’s little of this fakery inside the Peugeot’s cabin. If a surface looks nice (and most of them look terrific) it’ll almost certainly feel equally plush, too. This applies to everything from the soft dashboard trim and the solid centre console, and to the flashy metal-effect trim around the air vents. These vents sit right at the top of the dashboard, beside a high-mounted driver’s display that replaces old-fashioned analogue dials. This looks very similar to the setup you get in the smaller 208 and larger 3008 SUV, and means you peer over the steering wheel to read your speed rather than through it. The steering wheel itself is much smaller than in most cars and sits in your lap rather than at arm’s length. It’s an odd layout that’s tricky to get a good driving position with. Very lofty passengers might also struggle slightly to get comfy in the Peugeot 308’s back seats, but there’s plenty of space for kids to get comfy and the boot can easily swallow a family’s luggage for a weekend away. The Peugeot 308 is a comfortable family hatchback that, in typical French fashion, majors on chic style appeal. Its unconventional interior layout may take some getting used to, however Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Speaking of which, the Peugeot 308 is comfortable to drive for long periods, and cruises along happily at motorway speeds. If long drives are a common occurrence, you’ll want to check out the 308’s 1.5-litre diesel engine. It’s not particularly pokey, but is mostly quiet and returns around 50mpg in normal driving conditions without any great effort. If you aren’t planning any particularly long road-trips, you’ll be better off with one of the 308’s petrol or plug-in hybrid engines. There's also an electric version, called e-308, so you really can have it whichever way you please. The 1.2-litre petrol has more than enough power for town driving and country roads, while the hybrid is nippier and more economical – so long as you have somewhere to charge its battery up regularly. Both versions are easy to drive, quiet and comfortable. All Peugeot 308s are easy to see out of and the dinky steering wheel helps make light work of tight inner-city manoeuvres. Speaking of which, every version comes with rear-parking sensors as standard and you can pay extra for higher-spec cars with adaptive cruise control to help take the sting out of long motorway trips. That said, even entry-level cars come with plenty of equipment as standard, which helps justify their slightly steeper price tag than some less flashy family hatchbacks. If you’re looking for something that’ll stand out but don’t fancy a high-riding SUV, then the new Peugeot 308 is well worth a look. If you’re keen on this stylish family car, you can check out Carwow’s Peugeot 308 deals to see how much you could save.

peugeot,general,"Is the Peugeot e-308 a good car? Think of the new Peugeot e-308 as the concluding part of a trilogy: you can already buy a conventionally powered 308 and a plug-in hybrid, but now there’s a fully electric car to complete the set. The electric version is the most expensive of the three, which is to be expected as an electric car, but it’s also more expensive than most of the other battery-powered hatchbacks you might consider, such as the Volkswagen ID3, Citroen e-C4 and Renault Megane E-Tech. And that’s for the five-door hatchback; there’s also an e-308 SW, which is something of a rarity as there aren’t many electric estate cars. What do you get for your money? Well, aside from the usual 308 good stuff – stylish looks and an upmarket cabin – the entry-level Allure model comes with 18-inch alloy wheels, heated front seats and steering wheel, and satellite navigation is standard along with a rear-view camera. Safety kit includes autonomous emergency braking and adaptive cruise control to hold a safe distance from the vehicle in front. GT models are about £2,000 more, adding full matrix LED headlights, 3D LED taillights, a GT-specific grille, and wider sills to add more aggression to the looks. The seats are trimmed with soft Alcantara, there’s aluminium trim on the dash and door panels, and you get front parking sensors. The 3D digital instrument cluster is a neat touch that adds cool factor to the cabin. For a short period, there’s also a limited-run First Edition. This costs a fraction less than the GT and has an exclusive interior with upholstery that combines cloth, synthetic leather and Alcantara. The e-308 isn’t the cheapest route into an electric hatchback, but it’s got plenty of high-quality appeal Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer All three trim levels share the same electric motor and battery. The motor has 156hp, which should be enough for brisk rather than exciting performance – you won’t be keeping up with a Tesla Model 3, that’s for sure. The 54kWh battery offers an official range of up to 250 miles, though the higher-spec car manages a couple of miles less due to its larger alloy wheels. That’s a little behind the Volkswagen ID3 Pro’s 266-mile range, despite the fact the Peugeot comes with a heat pump as standard to improve efficiency. Using that 250 miles of range is a generally pleasant experience. The e-308 manages to be comfortable around town, yet still has a bit of fun about it when the road goes twisty. But only up to a point. For an electric car, it's not very punchy at all, with only 156hp on offer where 200hp is more of a base level for electric hatchbacks these days. It's fine, just feels a bit sluggish if you've ever driven any of those VW, Cupra, MG or Renault alternatives that pack a bit more power and therefore a more impressive acceleration. When you do need to stop and recharge, the e-308 is capable of topping up its batteries from 20-80% in about 30 minutes using a 100kW rapid charger. A full charge from a 7.4kW home wallbox takes seven hours and 20 minutes. So, is the Peugeot e-308 a good car? Well, the regular Peugeot 308 earned score of 8/10 on Carwow, so it’s off to a strong start, but there’s no getting away from the fact it costs more than the talented alternatives listed above, and can’t go quite as far as the best electric hatchbacks on a full charge. But the interior quality is a step above the likes of the VW ID3, Vauxhall Astra Electric or MG 4, and it’s an all-round high-quality experience.

peugeot,general,"Is the Peugeot 308 SW a good car? If you like the look of the Peugeot 308 but need a bit more space, the 308 SW estate could be the right car for you. With the larger boot space and a higher roof line, it’s considerably more practical than the hatchback and goes up against the likes of the Vauxhall Astra Sports Tourer, Volkswagen Golf Estate and Skoda Octavia Estate. It’s a lot like one of the big blue Ikea bags – it’s large, practical and it stands out from the crowd. The Peugeot’s a bit more fashionable, though. The exterior design incorporates a rather large grille with the new Peugeot shield at the centre and the headlights blended into the edges. The car also has fang-like daytime running lights that add extra detail to the front, while you get sharp lines and cool alloy wheel designs down the side. The SW’s rear lights have a 3D effect to them, while you also get more creases and thick cladding on the bumper. Inside, you’ll find Peugeot’s iCockpit concept. You get two 10.0-inch displays – one for the instruments and the other for the touchscreen infotainment – as well as comfort seats, sport pedals, gloss black trim, a small steering wheel and interesting materials on the dashboard. Room in the rear seats isn’t the best though. Unlike the spacious feeling you get up front, the rear seats are a bit cramped for adults, with head and knee room a little tight. The 308 SW also doesn’t have the widest door openings to fit child seats, and you then have to poke around in the seat base to attach the seat to the Isofix anchor points. It’s stand-out styling, good levels of equipment and decent efficiency make the 308 SW a good option in the estate market Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Conversely, boot space is pretty good. You get 608 litres in the standard SW, while the plug-in hybrid alternative’s area drops to 548 litres. That’s bigger than its chassis mate, the Vauxhall Astra Sports Tourer, and just pips the Volkswagen Golf Estate. It does lose out to the Skoda Octavia though. You can choose from a petrol, diesel or two plug-in hybrids – all of which are paired to an eight-speed automatic transmission. Both PHEVs can offer 40 miles of electric range, which can be held so you can use it when you need it. In town, the 308 SW feels a little juddery when going over bumps and the engine feels a little out of breath when you initially get going. But you get decent visibility all-round and the steering is quite light to make manoeuvring simple. On a long motorway cruise, the 308 SW comes into its own. The lack of comfort in town is swapped for a smooth ride at higher speeds, while all the engines will get you up to speed easily enough. While the lighter steering works well in town, it feels quite remote when you go on a twisty road. Sure that’s not what the 308 SW is made for, but it feels a little out of its comfort zone. The suspension soaks up the bumps okay, but you can expect some body roll. With a near class-leading boot and stylish looks, the Peugeot 308 SW is a decent estate car in many respects – but its interior space might not suit you. If you want the latest deals on the Peugeot 308 SW or other new Peugeot models, go through carwow, where you can also get used deals on Peugeots.

peugeot,general,"Is the Peugeot e-308 SW a good car? The Peugeot e-308 SW is one of those rare things - a fully electric estate car. Together with the mechanically identical Vauxhall Astra Sports Tourer Electric, it joins the bargain-basement MG5 EV and the Porsche Taycan Sport Turismo as the only such models on sale in the UK. Most car companies have so far preferred to sink their investment into electric SUVs, but an electric estate car has many benefits - it’s still very practical for a family, but being lower to the ground and lighter is more efficient than a tall, heavy SUV, and can therefore eke out that extra bit of range from the battery pack. A bit like Betamax, it’s a good idea that has a bit of an uphill struggle to compete with the flavour of the month - though unlike Betamax, it doesn’t look like the e-308 SW will be a total failure. In fact, it’s quite a likeable car, especially when you get inside. Like all current Peugeots, the e-308 SW has an interior that feels stylish, upmarket and packed with technology. A 10.0-inch touchscreen and digital instrument panel make it feel suitably up-to-date, but it’s the little features that make it feel premium - the posh-feeling toggle switches under the central screen, for example, or the big swathe of fabric running across the dashboard and the tops of the doors. Some drivers might not get on with Peugeot’s i-Cockpit setup, which places the instrument cluster high up above a shrunken steering wheel - which you look over, rather than through. You might find you need to lower the wheel more than you’re comfortable with to see the dials properly, so it could be worth taking a test drive to make sure you can get on with it. Peugeot e-308 SW: electric range, battery and charging data Range: 248 milesEfficiency: 4.1 miles per kWhBattery size: 51kWhMax charge speed: 100kWCharge time AC: 7hrs 30 mins, 0-100%, 7kWCharge time DC: 30 mins, 0-80%, 100kWCharge port location: Left rearPower output: 156hp Regardless of size you should have no trouble getting on with the e-308 SW’s practicality. Its 548-litre boot is huge, being long and wide with a completely flat floor when you fold the seats down. It’s ideal for big shops, trips to the flat-pack furniture store or the occasional tip run, and should be able to accommodate even a big pushchair with ease. Rear legroom isn’t quite as generous, but it’s sufficient for a six-foot adult - and the equal of any of the compact electric SUVs you might be considering as an alternative, like a Kia Niro EV or Volkswagen ID3. If it were a few thousand pounds cheaper the Peugeot e-308 SW would be an easy recommendation - but it’s more expensive than a Tesla Model 3 Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Peugeot is keen that its electric cars should feel no different to its petrol or diesel ones, so the e-308 SW is made to be as similar to the regular 308 as possible. To that end, you don’t get a particularly whizzy electric motor or bags and bags of power like some alternatives. A fairly modest power output here means excellent efficiency, allowing the e-308’s comparatively small battery to still provide a competitive range of up to 248 miles. That does mean, though, that if you want zippy performance - or a longer range - you’ll need to look elsewhere, as Peugeot only offers the one powertrain. It might also sting that the e-308 SW’s comparatively modest performance comes at an asking price several thousand pounds more than faster and longer-range contemporaries. If the price doesn’t put you off, why not find out more by browsing the best Peugeot e-308 SW deals right here on Carwow.

peugeot,general,"Is the Peugeot 408 a good car? The Peugeot 408 is the car you buy when you just can’t decide between a sleek saloon and a chunky SUV, as it’s basically the half-way point between the two. It has some of the ground clearance and plastic cladding of an SUV, but the low roofline and sleek shape of a saloon, and it kind of looks like an elephant has sat on a Lamborghini Urus. All of this means that it’s a bit tricky to work out where the 408 fits among alternatives you might be considering. The Honda Civic is around the same price, but the Peugeot is roomier. The Skoda Octavia is much more practical, but also much more conventional. Perhaps the semi-SUV likes of the Cupra Formentor and Renault Rafale make for a better comparison, as does the Citroen C5 X, which shares a chassis and engines with the 408, and which is similarly tricky to pigeon-hole. It’s almost daring in its style, but not all of what’s on show works. We like the pert rear end with the built-in spoiler, and the expressive headlights, but some of the chunky SUV-bits lower down on the body look quite awkward. Equally, if you go for the basic 17-inch alloy wheels, the 408 can look as if it’s been fitted with the wheels from a supermarket trolley — go for the optional 19-inch rims, or even the 20-inch wheels. The front end is pretty striking, with the body-coloured grille and the slashing LED running lights, but even so it’s hard to see the 408 as a coherent whole — it’s like lots of different cars all mixed into one, and they’re all fighting for supremacy. The cabin is a much quieter affair, and it shares a lot with the likes of the Peugeot 308 hatchback. The 408 does seem to have had a boost in quality though, and with the sweeping layout and the high-quality materials, you’d not be disappointed if you hopped out of a Volkswagen, or even an Audi, and straight into a 408. The infotainment system is good, too, thanks to a layout that’s easy enough to find your way around. There’s a handy set of digital buttons, which are shortcuts to the functions you need, and you can customise the layout of those shortcuts to your taste. There’s also wireless connections for Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, but it’s still annoying that you have to go into a separate on-screen menu for the climate control. Bring back buttons, please. The Peugeot 408’s cabin is fantastic, and more than a match for what you get from more premium brands Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The front seats are really good, but you should definitely take a test drive before buying as not everyone can get their driving position to match up with Peugeot’s small steering wheel and high-set instruments. The wheel is supposed to sit low down, while you look at the instruments over the top, but you might find that the wheel gets in the way of some of the dials. Space up front is decent, with storage areas under the armrest and door bins that are lined to avoid rattles. There are two big cup holders, and space in the back is surprisingly good, even with that low roof. It’s a little narrow, though, so the 408 is really a four-seater, as the middle rear seat is close to useless. You can choose from two plug-in hybrid versions, which should appeal to company car buyers with their low official CO2 ratings, but the company car tax system is changing this year, so business buyers might be better off waiting for the all-electric E-408 to arrive, with its 280-mile range. There’s also a basic 1.2-litre petrol hybrid version, which isn’t as powerful but feels sweeter to drive than the PHEV versions simply because it’s lighter. Given the 408’s ride height, you’d expect it to have a softly-softly SUV-style way over bumps, but it’s actually surprisingly stiff. It’s fine around town, but there’s a good bit of noise from both the suspension and the tyres on bigger roads, which makes the 408 less comfortable when cruising. The standard hybrid is slightly better off in this respect than the plug-in versions, which again is mostly down to its weight.

peugeot,general,"Is the Peugeot E-408 a good car? The Peugeot E-408 is the new electric version of the 408, a swoopy saloon/coupé/pseudo-SUV. It’s a bit like a Picasso painting; there’s a lot going on wherever you look, but it all comes together to make something rather striking. It’s yet another entrant into the coupé-SUV market, making it an alternative to the Renault Rafale, Citroen C5 X, Cupra Formentor and the Ford Mustang Mach-E. It may not be a ‘classically’ handsome design, but it’s hard to deny that the E-408 is a stylish car; even if it’s in an unconventional way. Peugeot is definitely showing some of its old ways with its current range, and the E-408 brings with it some additional French flair. Aggressive, pointy headlights and a ‘gradient’ grille give the E-408 a sporty nose, whilst at the back you’ll find a little flick-up spoiler above a pseudo-light bar and a rather large diffuser-style bumper trim. The fastback-style sloping roof and angular shoulder line give the jacked-up coupe a purposeful stance. Peugeot E-408: electric range, battery and charging data Range: 281 MilesEfficiency: 3.5-4.5 miles per kWhBattery size: 58kWhMax charge speed: 100kWCharge time AC: 5hrs20mins, 0-100%, 11kWhCharge time DC: 35mins, 20-80%, 100kWhCharge port location: Left Side RearPower outputs: 210hp The angular design theme continues inside the E-408, with a dashboard design that’s much less curvy than any alternatives. That’s not a critique though, in fact the multimedia display and control buttons facing the driver give the cockpit a real fighter-jet vibe; as does the small squared-off steering wheel perched below the driver display. Be warned though, some drivers might find that the steering wheel gets in the way of the driver’s screen if you set it too high so bear that in mind when getting comfy in the driver’s seat. Just like its petrol and hybrid stablemates, the E-408’s cabin will be full of posh, soft-touch materials and good standard kit. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto should be all you need these days, but if you’re a fan of manufacturer systems then Peugeot’s own ‘i-Connect’ infotainment system is a great one to use. The Peugeot E-408 may not quite fit into one category of car, but it’s still a practical and family-friendly choice with a great interior Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The rakish roofline would suggest that rear seat and boot space is compromised but you’d be surprised. Boot space is less than a petrol-powered 408 but the same as the 408 hybrid, whilst rear seat space is likely to be the same too. Expect adequate head room for adults in the back, even if it is a little cosy for shoulder space. When it comes to performance, the E-408 is no slouch but don’t go expecting lap records either. A 210hp motor and 58kWh battery promises up to 281 miles of range which is similar to what alternatives can manage. The E-408 can go from 20-80% charge in 30 minutes on a 100kW rapid charger, which is okay, if not fantastic We’ll have a full review for you as soon as we get our hands on this swoopy-looking electric car, but in the meantime you can get ahead on Carwow’s Peugeot E-408 deals.

peugeot,general,"Is the Peugeot 3008 a good car? Peugeot’s 3008 has shot up the ranks since the first one was launched more than a decade ago. It may have started as a tall (and somewhat ugly) crossover, but now it’s a fully-fledged SUV-coupe, with really stylish looks and much more high-tech kit. It’s like someone who used to be a bit podgy, but has hit the gym and overhauled their wardrobe. While the all-electric version, the E-3008, might get all the headlines, a big chunk of the 3008’s sales in the UK will be taken by this, the hybrid model — not least because, in spite of all the new on-board technology, it’s a fairly handy £10,000 less expensive than the E-3008… That being said, there are plenty of compelling alternatives to the Peugeot 3008, many of which are a bit more affordable. Some of the best all-rounders include the Nissan Qashqai, Kia Sportage and Hyundai Tucson. Then there's the practical, great value Citroen C5 Aircross and stylish but impractical Toyota C-HR to consider, too. Power for the 3008 Hybrid comes from a 134bhp 1.2-litre three-cylinder petrol engine — that’s the same one that Peugeot has been making for donkey’s years, but it’s been upgraded for life as a hybrid. The system sort of sits between a ‘traditional’ Toyota-style full hybrid and a mild-hybrid. So, the 3008 Hybrid can drive itself on electric power alone, but only for very short bursts at very low speeds. It’s good for around town, but less useful on long motorway hauls. Peugeot reckons you’ll get 51mpg out of it, and CO2 emissions are kept to a trim 124g/km. Inside, there’s a huge, sweeping all-digital 21.0-inch screen that dominates the cabin. It sits up and away from the driver, almost resting against the windscreen. As is Peugeot’s recent tradition, the steering wheel is small, hexagonal, and sits more or less in your lap. We've tried it in the E-3008 and it's much easier to find a comfortable driving position where the wheel doesn't block the instrument display than ever before, but it's probably still worth trying before you buy. The 3008 is now a fully-fledged SUV-coupe, with really stylish looks and much more high-tech kit Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer To the right of the steering wheel is a slim touchpad which has configurable shortcut buttons for the big screen so that you can access the menus you need more easily, but sadly Peugeot insists on putting all of the climate control functions on the screen, which makes it more fiddly than it needs to be. The gear lever is now a chunky toggle switch behind the steering wheel, so that leaves the centre console free for cupholders and storage spaces, of which there are loads, and the 3008’s mixture of back-lighting and soft fabric surfaces on the dashboard make for a cabin that’s almost good enough to challenge the mighty Germans on quality, and surpass them on design. In spite of that rakish roof, there’s good space in the back seats, even for grown-ups, although those with longer legs will find that their feet and knees sit up a bit too high, as the floor has been raised up to make space for the electric version’s battery pack. The boot is a useful 520 litres, but that sloping roofline makes loading in really bulky items a bit of a challenge, and alternatives such as the Hyundai Tucson have a larger capacity. Speaking of that roofline, the Peugeot 3008 is a really good-looking thing. It manages to be imposingly chunky while also sporting sleek lines and cool details such as Peugeot's signature three-claw light designs. Stick with Carwow if you want the best Peugeot 3008 deals.

peugeot,general,"Is the Peugeot E-3008 a good car? Until recently, most of Peugeot’s EV efforts have been focused on its smaller vehicles like the e-208 and e-2008. Now, akin to a martial arts student finally ready to take on the dojo master, Peugeot is stepping into the big leagues with its all-electric E-3008. This stylish electric SUV is an alternative to the likes of the Skoda Elroq, Hyundai Ioniq 5, Renault Scenic E-Tech and Tesla Model Y. Each of those alternatives has a unique identity and style, and the Peugeot E-3008 brings its own blend of futuristic design to the party. It looks great, with a sloping roof at the rear, sharp, sculpted lines across the body and a prominent grille up front. Inside, and unlike the screens on most vehicles, which are split into a driver display and infotainment section, the E-3008 has one super-wide 21.0-inch panoramic curved display. It also retains the small diameter hexagonal steering wheel which remains a love-or-hate design depending on whether it obscures your view of the instruments. Peugeot E-3008: electric range, battery and charging data Range: 326 milesEfficiency: 4.5 miles per kWhBattery size: 73kWhMax charge speed: 160kWCharge time AC: 10hr 30mins, 0-100% at 7kWCharge time DC: 30 mins, 20-80% at 160kWCharge port location: Left side rearPower outputs: 210hp The cabin, with its cool ambient lighting and swooping design elements, would look perfectly at home in a Blade Runner movie, and the quality of the materials used is up there with some premium brands. Passenger space in the rear is decent, although the footwell can be a little cramped depending on how low the front seats are set. The boot is a decent size at 520 litres, although there is no front boot as you get in a Tesla Model Y. The Peugeot claws back an advantage when it comes to its electric motor and battery. It has an impressive 326-mile range, which comes down to a very efficient drivetrain, and if you have access to a 160kW fast charger, it can go from 20-80% charge in just 30 minutes. The Peugeot E-3008 has a funky interior that’s about as far from Tesla minimalism as you can get Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The driving experience is smooth and the car responds intuitively to inputs, making it easy and relaxing to drive. Visibility out front is great, taking the stress out of town driving, although larger bumps can unsettle the serenity inside the cabin. You’ll also need to rely heavily on the rear parking sensor and camera, as there is a notable blind spot out the rear. The E-3008 is a consummate long-distance cruiser, but it’s not the most dynamic vehicle around the corners — the lighter petrol version may be better here, though we’ve not been behind the wheel yet — and it’s got adequate rather than impressive acceleration. The premium of just over £10,000 over the petrol-powered 3008 does seem steep, but its pricing is in line with other all-electric SUVs, and thanks to the plush cabin design, it certainly feels like a quality product.

peugeot,general,"Is the Peugeot 5008 a good car? The Peugeot 5008 is the bigger, seven-seat sibling of the Peugeot 3008. It has the same underpinnings as that car - same engines, hybrid systems, and even most of the same interior. But it’s larger, with more space in the cabin and a much bigger boot. It’s like swapping jackets for one that looks the same but has massive hidden pockets. We like it so much the Peugeot 5008 received a Highly Commended award in the Family Values category at the 2025 Carwow Car of the Year Awards. It certainly cuts a rug, and makes a stylish alternative to the likes of the Skoda Kodiaq, Hyundai Santa Fe and Nissan X-Trail. There is a fully electric Peugeot E-5008, which we’ve reviewed separately, but this page will focus on the simpler and more affordable hybrid and plug-in hybrid models. At the front, the 5008 shares its style with the smaller 3008. There’s a huge body-coloured grille which stretches across the whole front of the car, flanked by LED daytime running lights which are meant to look as though a lion (Peugeot’s mascot) has slashed the front of the car with its claws. Though it’s not exactly pretty, the effect is striking and it stands out in a world of anonymous-looking family SUVs such as the Volkswagen Tiguan. Further back, the 5008 gets a much squarer roofline than the dramatically sloping 3008. It’s quite blocky, but that’s necessary to provide good headroom for the occupants of the third row of seats - and a bigger boot when it’s folded away. It certainly pays off, as the middle row of seats has way more space for heads, knees and feet than you get in the 3008. You also get three individual rear seats which split and fold in a 40:20:40 arrangement, making it much more flexible for balancing passengers and load space. As with all modern Peugeots, the 5008 has a lovely interior, and this model having seven seats makes it super-practical as a large family car Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The third row has space for adults for very short trips - though kids will be more comfortable back there. Even the 5008’s 348-litre boot (with all the seats up) is pretty reasonable, but with just five seats in place you get a mammoth 916 litres of space, which is bigger than the Hyundai Santa Fe or the Skoda Kodiaq. Front-seat passengers are well catered-for too, with a dashboard that goes hard on high-tech features. There’s a huge screen setup that stretches right across the top of the dash and covers off driver information and infotainment, plus a configurable panel of ‘i-Toggles’ which lets you set customisable shortcuts to almost any of the car’s functions. There’s no question that it looks good, even if the styling is a little busy, and it feels great too. The plastics are high quality and much of the dash is covered in fabric, giving it a softer, sofa-like feel that’s very luxurious. Engine options are both hybrid - there’s a 136hp 1.2-litre which sounds as though it’s going to be way too weedy, but actually copes well even with a fully-loaded car. If you’d prefer something a little more effortless, there’s a 196hp plug-in hybrid which can manage up to 48 miles of fully electric range and promises super-low fuel bills if you keep it topped up. Regardless of engine, the 5008 is comfortable to drive, though shelve any expectations you might have that this model has anything to do with the brand’s Peugeot Sport division. Despite the supportive seats and sporty steering wheel, the 5008 is not set up to be fun in the corners - instead, it’s easy and relaxing to drive.

peugeot,general,"Is the Peugeot E-5008 a good car? There really aren’t very many all-electric seven-seat cars right now, and precious few which are priced to compete with the Peugeot E-5008. Buying one of these kind of feels like shopping in an outlet mall — you’re getting something trendy and stylish that costs less than you thought. Other seven-seat electric cars include the Mercedes EQB and Kia EV9, though they are a bit more expensive and a lot more expensive respectively, while the Volkswagen ID Buzz splits the two. There’s also a petrol-powered 5008, which is a more affordable option if you’re not fully committed to an EV. On design alone, the Peugeot E-5008 runs the uber-cool Kia EV9 close, which is high praise indeed. The Peugeot has a wide grille that blends in with the bodywork and the signature three-claw running lights up front, while round the back the cool light design continues. Peugeot E-5008: electric range, battery and charging data Range: 310 milesEfficiency: 3.5mi/kWhBattery size: 73kWhMax charge speed: 160kWCharge time AC: 4hrs, 20-80%, 11kWCharge time DC: 30mins, 20-80%, 160kWCharge port location: Left side rearPower outputs: 210hp Things continue to impress inside. The dashboard design is super-futuristic, and you get an ultra-wide display behind a large pane of glass that looks like something from an expensive BMW, along with another smaller touch-sensitive panel with customisable shortcut icons. It makes it feel more posh inside, but the touchscreen is a bit awkward to use and not particularly responsive, which is a bit of a shame. Still, the materials are largely decent with an upmarket feel, and the trim is solidly put together. There are some cheaper plastics low down in the cabin, but that feels fair for the price. You get loads of storage, which is good news for a big family car. The door bins can take a bottle and are felt-lined so things don’t rattle around, there’s a big cubby hole beneath the armrest, and a standard-fit wireless charging pad nestled beneath the main screen. There's plenty of room in the second row, though it is a bit of a squeeze to fit three people here. The third row is easy to access and headroom is good once you’re in, but kneeroom is very tight and there’s not much thigh support. These seats are best limited to younger children, though disappointingly you don’t get ISOFIX in this row, unlike in the Kia EV9. The Peugeot E-5008 has a cool, ultra-modern interior, though it’s a shame the infotainment system can’t quite match the likes of BMW Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The boot is a practical size, too. Space behind the third row is okay, and about the same as alternatives have, but you won’t fit much more than a couple of aeroplane carry-on bags. Drop the third row and you get a cavernous 916 litres, which is beaten only by the Volkswagen ID Buzz. At the moment you only have one battery option, offering a range of up to 310 miles, which is about the same as base versions of the Kia EV9, but more than an equivalent VW ID Buzz, Mercedes EQB and Tesla Model Y. However, a big battery that offers up to 415 miles between charges is on the way, so that could be worth waiting for if you do regular long journeys. Speaking of which, the Peugeot E-5008 is an easy place to sit for hours behind the wheel, because it’s really comfortable over bumps and there’s not too much wind or road noise to worry about. It’s not very quick though, so overtakes aren’t as thought-free as they are with most EVs. Still, it’s easy enough to drive around town, with 360-degree cameras to make navigating this big car through tight spots easier, and it handles better than you might expect on a twisty road.

peugeot,general,"Is the Peugeot e-Rifter a good car? If you’re in the market for a family MPV with an all-electric powertrain and loads of interior space, the Peugeot e-Rifter may be the car you’re after. While it might not be the most enticing-looking thing, it has all the attributes for those who need to lug things or people around regularly. As long as it’s within a reasonably short distance. The e-Rifter is a bit like a lightweight Cesna aircraft. Sure it’s great at shorter distances and very good at that. But you’ll be making plenty of stops if you want to go on any long-distance trips. It shares underpinnings with the Citroen e-Berlingo and Vauxhall Combo Life Electric, so if it looks familiar that could be why. Unlike the VW ID Buzz, which is a style icon, the e-Rifter ranks among the more reserved offerings. It’s slab-sided and won’t be winning any design awards, but has a smart face that will be pleasing to some. The cabin also isn’t the most exciting, but it has got either blue or orange sections to brighten up the otherwise black and grey finish. You get Peugeot’s funky iCockpit setup, while there are loads of storage bins and cubbies to hold your things, which makes for a very practical cabin. Rear space is also pretty good, while the boot is well-sized, although you’ll have to contend with a large tailgate, so make sure you don’t park too close to anything at the back. It’s not the nicest-feeling cabin though, as durability is the keyword with the e-Rifter. Scratchy plastics cover a lot of the surfaces, while the compact steering wheel is only leather-covered in the GT version. For the additional space, the long-wheelbase e-Rifter is a practical town car. Shame it doesn’t have the battery capacity for longer distance Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer As with the cabin, the drive system is pretty underwhelming. You get a 50kWh battery pack paired to a front-mounted electric motor – and that’s on both the standard or long-wheelbase version. But on both, the official range of 172 miles isn’t likely to be enough for most families – especially if longer journeys are likely to be part of the mix. On such lengthier runs, efficiency isn’t great. Being boxy in shape, the e-Rifter doesn’t cut through the air very well, so you get a lot of wind noise. You also run through your battery quickly, and we found you’re more likely to go not much further than 100 miles on motorway drives. The e-Rifter is better suited to life off the motorway. With its lighter steering and large windows all-around, you have good credentials for town family runaround. The electric motor gets you up to speed quickly enough, while the option of regenerative braking to recoup charge helps negotiate slower moving traffic – although the car won’t come to a stop on its own due to the lack of a one-pedal drive mode. Vans aren’t great to drive on twistier roads, and the e-Rifter conforms to that stereotype. It feels cumbersome as the electric motor is only just powerful enough, but it doesn’t lean too much in bends as the batteries are mounted in the floor to help with stability. While it may have some major drawbacks, the Peugeot e-Rifter is better suited to people needing a large car for around town and who don’t need to venture too far from home with it. It also isn’t too pricey, especially against the Volkswagen ID. Buzz. Plus it has the option of seven seats – a rare asset among smaller EVs. And if you want to get a great deal on the e-Rifter, check out carwow, where you can also browse offers on the latest Peugeot models as well.

peugeot,general,"Is the Peugeot e-Traveller a good car? The large and boxy Peugeot e-Traveller can’t hide its van origins on the outside, but its interior looks and feels much like a contemporary family car. With the added benefit of tons of space and plenty of configurability. You can decide on the number and layout of the seats as well as standard and long wheelbase versions. This is essentially a customisable chest of drawers with wheels. All versions are powered by a 134bhp electric motor paired to a 50kWh battery pack. There are three driving modes (Eco, Normal and Power), each progressively increasing the available power output. A range of 148 miles is claimed on the WLTP cycle, with a charge from 0-80% taking 30-minutes using a 100kW fast charger. An 11kW wallbox will do the job in 5 hours. If you’re in a tight spot and need to charge from a domestic wall socket, it will take 31 hours to get from 0-100%. It's the same as the Citroen e-SpaceTourer and Vauxhall Vivaro Life Electric, which are almost identical bar the front-end styling. The two trims on offer are called Business and Business VIP, a subtle hint at what Peugeot expects most e-Travellers will be used for. That doesn’t preclude it from being a rather practical family vehicle though, especially since you can seat between four to nine occupants based on the seat layout. Both trims can be had in standard and long wheelbase versions. The two trims on offer are called Business and Business VIP, a subtle hint at what Peugeot expects most e-Travellers will be used for, but it's still a practical family vehicle Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The base trim comes with manual air conditioning, rear parking sensors, cloth seats and 17-inch black steel wheels. Business VIP adds several useful extras like keyless entry, hands free electric sliding rear doors and sat nav. An optional safety pack adds driver aids like adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning and automatic emergency braking. Interior space is cavernous, with up to 1,162 litres of boot space available on long wheelbase models even with nine seats in place. With five seats in place, you can pack in 3,000-litres of cargo (4,900-litres with both rear rows removed). The huge rear tailgate and low load lip make it easier to load bulky and heavy items.

peugeot,general,"Is the Peugeot 508 a good car? If you need a large family car, but don’t want to be go for the boring side of sensible just yet, the Peugeot 508 could be the model for you. If a Volkswagen Passat is a smart shirt-and-chinos combo, the 508 is more of a sharp Givenchy suit, probably worn by a model smoking Gauloise outside a Left Bank cafe. It’s tres cool. And an update in 2023 means it's even better looking than before. The ultra-slim headlights blend into daytime running lights that look like they've been etched by a claw strike from a big lion. The grille blends into the bodywork, which is a unique look, while the rear LED lights have a new design with three angled lines. But while its stylish five-door hatchback/saloon/coupe body looks great – and there's a more practical yet still very fancy-looking 508 SW estate version, too – the back seats are noticeably more cramped than in alternatives such as the Skoda Superb or Volkswagen Passat. It's an appealing option in a dwindling selection of saloon-style models, though; former options such as the Ford Mondeo and Vauxhall Insignia have been dropped due to falling sales. Okay, so you might have to put up with a few complaints from tall passengers in the back, but you certainly can’t accuse the Peugeot 508’s interior of being boring. Its dashboard design is far more interesting than most alternatives and all models come with two large infotainment screens that make the cabin look bang-up-to-date. If you’re more interested in old-fashioned, solid build quality, however, the Peugeot 508 might not be the car for you. It’s certainly not terrible, but the Peugeot’s materials don’t feel as consistently brilliant as those in a Skoda Superb. But driving the Peugeot 508 feels much sportier than pottering about in the Skoda thanks to the 508’s low-set driving position. Not everyone will be a fan of its small steering wheel, though. If you can see past the fact it's a bit cramped inside, the Peugeot 508 is a comfortable family car that really stands out from the crowd Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The boot isn’t the biggest – look to a Superb if that is what matters most to you – but the 508’s large hatchback door makes loading bulky items relatively easy, even if you do have to lift them over a slight boot lip. So, the Peugeot 508’s practicality might not be particularly impressive, but if you’re considering a sporty-looking saloon car, you’ll likely have more than a passing interest in how it drives – and you won’t be too disappointed. The Peugeot 508 is fun to drive down a twisty road, but also manages to smooth out bumps quite effectively too. There's also a sporty Peugeot Sport Engineered (PSE) version if you want more ability in the bends. The 508 isn’t quite so clever when it comes to autonomous driving tech, however. It’s available with active cruise control and lane assist, but these systems aren’t as sophisticated as those you’ll find in a Volvo V60. The engine lineup is limited now to one petrol and one hybrid, plus a more powerful hybrid system in the sporty PSE. The entry-level engine is a 1.2-litre petrol with 131hp that gets up to 50mpg in official tests. However, for ultimate fuel economy, you can drive around 40 miles on electricity alone with the 225hp plug-in hybrid engine. You'll have to keep the batteries topped up and drive like a saint to achieve its official 274mpg economy figure, though. There will be no saintly driving in the other plug-in version, the 360hp 508 PSE. Think of it as the 508’s answer to the BMW M340i in that it's sportier than the regular model, but it's not supposed to be a hardcore performance car. Other family cars are better built and more spacious, but if that all sounds a bit too ‘pipe and slippers’ for you, then the 508’s stylish design and fun drive make it worthy of a place on your shortlist. Check out how much you could save in the Peugeot 508 deals section.

skoda,general,"Is the Skoda Karoq a good car? The Karoq is Skoda doing what it does best — creating a simple, usable, practical family car and selling it to you for a reasonable price. If you’re expecting dramatic, dynamic driving or performance, look elsewhere; but stick around if what you’re after is a solid, sensible, reliable family SUV. Basically, it’s the Ecco shoes of the car world. The Karoq is also a Skoda that hits the family crossover market right in the bullseye — it’s simple and effective, and one of those cars that slots seamlessly into your life. The raised driving position has obvious appeal, as does the solid build quality and the plethora of clever features (such as an ice scraper built into the fuel flap, and a small tab in the windscreen for holding a pay-and-display ticket). It’s not a car to buy if aesthetics are your thing — alternatives such as the Hyundai Tucson, Nissan Qashqai, and Peugeot 3008 all wear suits of a sharper cut — but neither is it bereft of style. Two-element headlights (shared with the larger, but mechanically similar Kodiaq) give it a little bit of visual interest at the front, and the rest of the styling is crisp and neat, if entirely predictable. Some recent mid-life updates to the styling have kept the car looking fresh, without making sweeping changes. Inside, that sensible, solid style continues. If you’re looking for wild colours or eye-searing patterns, then look elsewhere — that’s not Skoda’s bag. If that means that the Karoq’s cabin isn’t the most thrilling place to be, then it also means that it’s big on being easy to use and simple in its layout. That simplicity includes the standard 8.0-inch central touchscreen, which has big, clear menu ‘buttons’; while the recent addition of the two-spoke multifunction steering wheel from the Octavia and Enyaq iV is a nice touch. As you grip that wheel and fiddle with the touchscreen, you’ll also notice that you’re sitting very comfortably. Every model comes with height-adjustable front seats and manual lumbar adjustment, and even for tall adults there’s proper stretching room. In the back, there’s just about enough space for three adults to sit next to one another (although the one in the middle would want to be on the slimmer side…). The Skoda Karoq is a no-frills family SUV with a very practical cabin and a range of sensible, economical engines Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Behind the second row lies the Karoq’s family-friendly trump card: an absolutely massive, square, flat-floored boot. Need to make that boot bigger? Well then just choose a Karoq with the ‘VarioFlex’ rear seats, which are standard from the SE L and optional on the entry-level SE Drive. You can slide them forward to find more boot space, ranging from 478 litres to 588 litres, but when they're fixed it's 521 litres. The Hyundai Tucson is the only alternative that's larger, while the Peugeot 3008 and Nissan Qashqai are about the same when the seats are in place. The Karoq rides comfortably over bumps and lumps with only an occasional very sharp intrusion causing any discomfort. The cabin is also very quiet, aside from a little bit of wind rustle around the door mirrors and a touch of tyre rumble at cruising speeds. Around town, the Karoq is very smooth and easy to handle, but be aware that the optional DSG automatic gearbox can be a touch sluggish to respond at low speeds – especially in combination with the 150hp 2.0-litre TDI diesel engine. Actually, if you’re mostly driving in town, then the Karoq’s basic 1.0-litre TSI turbo petrol engine is the best choice. It might sound a bit weedy given the size of the car around it, but it’s actually surprisingly peppy at urban speeds, and works well with the standard six-speed manual gearbox. The diesel engine options are a better fit if long motorway runs make up most of your daily mileage, and if that’s the case then it’s well worth considering getting the optional active cruise control and lane-keeping steering too. So, the Skoda Karoq adds up to being one of the most sensible and useful family SUVs on the market. If you think one should make it onto your shopping list, then see how much you can save by checking out our Skoda Karoq deals.

skoda,general,"Is the Skoda Kamiq a good car? This is the Skoda Kamiq, a smart but fuss-free small SUV. Fuss-free, because while alternatives such as the Ford Puma, Peugeot 2008 and Jeep Avenger try to win you over with funky styling and a bit of quirkiness, the Kamiq is all about being sensible and practical. It’s a bit like choosing comfy trainers over a pair of stilettos. Not that the Skoda Kamiq is unattractive, it’s just very safe. You get the typical boxy SUV shape, with some slim daytime running lights up front, a few creases in the bodywork here and there, and rear lights that make the car look nice and wide. It’s all very classy and understated. The interior is a bit simpler. There are no great design flourishes to catch your eye, and the materials are pretty nice considering this is a budget-friendly model. You get a smart piece of trim that cuts through the centre of the dashboard, and all but the entry-level model get a 9.2-inch infotainment display and digital instruments. Where the Kamiq really stands out is space and practicality in the cabin. There’s loads of space in the front with plenty of adjustment in the driver’s seat and steering wheel to get comfy, and while you won’t be giving a team of basketball players a lift anytime soon, the back seats are generously spacious for a car of this size. At 400 litres, the boot should be big enough for most people most of the time, but it’s smaller than you get in the Peugeot 2008 and Ford Puma. The Skoda Kamiq is a head over heart purchase, but that’s what makes it so appealing Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Under the bonnet there are no electric or hybrid options, just petrol engines with a choice of three power outputs. However, they all offer pretty low running costs, with low emissions meaning they’re fairly cheap to tax despite the lack of electrification. Even the entry-level option with 95hp has adequate oomph, particularly if you’re just using the Kamiq around town, though one of the more powerful options makes smooth progress less effort the rest of the time. And low effort is the name of the game when driving the Skoda Kamiq. The suspension soaks up lumps and bumps in the road really well at all speeds, and it’s impressively refined on the motorway for a smaller car. It’s not much fun on a twisty road though, and the automatic gearbox can be a bit clunky and easily confused at lower speeds. These are generally minor complaints, though, in what is overall a fantastically practical and affordable package. You can get yourself a great price by checking out Carwow’s Skoda Kamiq deals, and find a great price on a used Kamiq from our network of trusted dealers.

The old car won hearts thanks to its spacious, clever interior, comfortable drive and good-value price tag - and the new model continues that trend but with the added bonus of a posh interior and some really up-to-date engine options that earned it a Highly Commended award in the Family Values category of the 2025 Carwow Car of the Year Awards. It’s like when Lidl and Aldi progressed from simply being budget supermarkets to offering fancy wine and ‘Specially Selected’ foodstuffs - you still get great value, but you don’t necessarily feel like it’s a bargain-basement proposition. The Kodiaq is more of a 5+2 seater car - with seats six and seven being better suited to occasional use or for children rather than full-sized adults. That makes it a natural alternative if you’re considering cars such as the Peugeot 5008, Land Rover Discovery Sport or Nissan X-Trail. The Kodiaq’s design is instantly recognisable as a Skoda, and looks a lot like the old car simply went through a smoothing filter. It has sleeker headlights, a wider grille and a longer, lower appearance - helped by the new Kodiaq being six centimetres longer than the car it replaces. Even base-spec models look smart, but step up to higher trim levels and you get eye-catching 20-inch alloy wheels, contrasting body panels and even an LED strip running through the grille. Just because it’s more stylish doesn’t mean it’s less practical, though. There’s loads of space in the second row of seats with miles of headroom and legroom, and it’s wide enough to fit three across the bench too - even if the middle seat is a bit of a narrow perch. Family SUVs didn't get any better than the last Skoda Kodiaq - and this new model looks like it'll be even better Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The third row, meanwhile, is just about big enough to squeeze adults in for short journeys, but it’s much better used for children or teenagers who’ll have more than enough space. Even with all seats in place there’s 340 litres of boot space, which is highly respectable. Plug-in hybrid models are five-seater only, though. Storage up front is good too, with big door bins and plenty of large cubbyholes, though the cupholders are a little poky. The most impressive upgrade from the old Kodiaq is in cabin design and quality. The swooping dashboard looks almost as smart as the German alternatives, and uses several different materials to break it up rather than simply being a big slab of black plastic. It’s dominated by a massive 13.0-inch touchscreen which has sharp graphics and is easy to navigate. But happily Skoda has also included some physical controls in the form of three configurable dials, which help stop you having to dig through touchscreen menus while on the move. The Skoda Kodiaq will be offered with five engines from launch - two petrol, one plug-in hybrid and unusually two diesel options too. All of them get an automatic gearbox, and power outputs for the pure combustion models range from 150hp to 204hp. There’s also four-wheel drive available on the more powerful diesel. The plug-in hybrid Kodiaq will be the best bet for company car drivers and could well prove to be a real money-saver if you regularly charge it up. It’ll do more than 60 miles on battery power alone, and can even fast-charge, making it a really useful proposition for those who want a taste of the EV life but can’t or don’t want to go full electric. Whichever engine you select, you can be sure of an easy, pleasant drive. The Kodiaq won’t win any awards for driver pleasure, but if your goal is to get yourself and a car full of people to their destination quietly, comfortably and without getting anybody car sick, the big Skoda excels. If all this sounds good, then check out our latest Skoda Kodiaq deals. You could also check out used examples of the previous Skoda Kodiaq, or other used Skodas here.

skoda,general,"Is the Skoda Enyaq a good car? This is the Skoda Enyaq, an electric SUV that’s comfortable, practical and handsome in an understated way. But it’s the ultimate head over heart purchase, because it’s so sensible it’s like the straight-A student who never stayed out past 10pm and now earns a good wage in middle management. Admirable, impressive, but never cool. Not that there are too many rock stars in the electric family car market – some fun, stylish alternatives include the Ford Mustang Mach-e, Cupra Born, Hyundai Ioniq 5 and Volvo EX30. All that being said, the Skoda Enyaq’s design works well if you want a car that doesn’t shout its arrival at the school gates or office car park – though you can go for the gaudy illuminated front grille if you want to add a little pizazz. It’s a bit more exciting inside, with a dashboard that swoops down in the centre and up at either side, with a large infotainment display placed in the middle. Updates for 2024 have improved the software for this, and while it’s a bit zippier and more intuitive to use than before, it’s still one of the laggier infotainment systems you’ll find. Skoda Enyaq: electric range, battery and charging data Range: 247-348 milesEfficiency: 3.7-4.1 miles per kWhBattery size: 62kWh / 82kWhMax charge speed: 120kW / 135kW / 175kWCharge time AC: 9h 12mins, 0-100%, 7.2kW / 12h 13mins, 0-100%, 7.2kWCharge time DC: 35mins, 0-80%, 120kW / 28mins, 0-80%, 135kW/175kWCharge port location: Right side rearPower outputs: 179hp / 286hp / 340hp Material quality is great throughout though, and there’s loads of space for adults to get comfy in the front and back seats. The boot is massive too, with more capacity than all alternatives except for the Tesla Model Y. It doesn’t have a front boot like the Tesla does, either. And while both the Model Y and Enyaq can go a mighty long way between charges, the Skoda goes a bit further. Updates to the big battery model mean it can now go up to 348 miles before needing a top up. Fast charge times are similar between the two, though the Tesla’s peak charge rate is a bit higher. Along with more range, Skoda has given these ‘85’ models more power than before (though the entry-level ‘60’ versions are unchanged), and you can really feel it on the road. The Tesla might be more powerful still, but put your foot down on a motorway slip road and you’ll be up to the national speed limit in no time in the Skoda – it’s certainly more than enough oomph for everyday driving. The Skoda Enyaq isn't particularly exciting, but it's a fantastic all-rounder – good to drive, practical, and not too expensive Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer That said, it’s not the most fun thing to point down a twisty road, because the steering is light and there’s not a huge amount of grip from the tyres – the Ford Mustang Mach-e is a better bet for that. The Enyaq is much better around town, where the suspension deals well with bumps in the road and the punchy motors make it easy to nip into gaps in traffic. Motorway driving is quiet and relaxing, too. So, this isn’t a car to set your pulse racing, but if you want a car that does all the day-to-day family stuff well without a fuss, it’s an excellent option. The increased range of the latest models only adds to the appeal. Check out the latest Skoda Enyaq deals on Carwow to see how much you could save, or browse used Enyaqs from our network of trusted dealers. You can also take a look at other used Skodas, and if you want to sell your car online, Carwow can help with that, too.",,Carwow
skoda,general,"Is the Skoda Elroq a good car? Skoda is no stranger to the medium-sized SUV game, having turned out some rather excellent examples of the breed since the Yeti. The new Elroq takes Skoda into mid-size electric SUV territory for the first time though, using the larger Enyaq as a starting point. And much like comparing an iPod Nano to an original iPod, the Elroq takes the Enyaq recipe and wraps it up in a smaller package. It’s an alternative to the Kia EV3, Renault Scenic E-Tech and Peugeot E-3008 - but it’s nowhere near as funky to look at. It's a handsome, futurstuc looking car - but in a rather plain way. A first for Skoda, the Elroq features slim headlights which join up to a small, blanked off ‘grille’ called the Tech Deck. It hides all of the car’s cameras and sensors leaving the front end looking neat. That plus the sharp lines and creases around the Elroq are nice touches, but there’s just nothing that really stands out about it. Skoda Elroq: electric range, battery and charging data Range: 232-355 milesEfficiency: 4.0mi/kWhBattery size: 52kWh - 77kWhMax charge speed: 175kWCharge time AC: 7hrs 33 - 12hrs (0-100%, 7.2kW)Charge time DC: 25 - 28mins (10-80%, 128kW)Charge port location: Rear rightPower outputs: 170hp, 204hp, 286hp Inside, the Elroq is much the same as the Enyaq, but that’s a good thing. The dashboard is sleek and clutter-free, with a design that swoops low in the middle towards the centre console, below the large infotainment display. You can spec the main dashboard surface in a funky denim-esque fabric or leatherette in the pricier models, though the fabric is more fun. Comfy seats with a good driving position, lots of adjustability and a clear driver display go a long way to justifying Skoda’s ‘Simply Clever’ catchphrase, as do the adjustable and removable storage solutions such as cup holders, umbrellas in the front doors and even the standard-fit ice scraper. And though it’s smaller than the Enyaq, the Elroq is still a very practical proposition. It may not have a front boot such as the Tesla Model Y or as much boot space as the Peugeot E-3008, but the 470-litre boot is plenty big enough for a family’s day-to-day life - and the Elroq is cheaper to buy. There’s space below the boot floor to hold smaller items out of view, too. The Elroq is a great EV to do road trips in, but it’s never going to set your heart alight Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer You can choose from three battery options for the Elroq, but they’re spec-dependent. Entry level ‘50’ cars have a 52kWh battery capacity and an official range of 232 miles. There’s also a ‘60’ mid-range model, but Edition and Sportline cars can be had with a 77kWh battery and 355 miles of range. On the road the soft suspension and big tyres combine to give the Elroq a comfortable, pillowy ride. It’s quiet and comfortable over broken roads, but bigger bumps can unsettle the car and leave you wallowing until the suspension regains its composure. Light steering is a breeze when parking and navigating tight roads. Motorways are much the same, generally very comfortable and only feeling floaty over big dips. Twisty roads aren’t much fun and the Elroq doesn’t feel very grippy in faster corners, with the light steering feeling vague. Fortunately there’s not too much body lean, but country lanes are best taken at a moderate pace. It’s a solid all-rounder though, and it’s definitely worth considering as a family car.

skoda,general,"Is the Skoda Superb a good car? The Skoda Superb is a big, practical family car - which is something of a dying breed these days. Most other manufacturers are moving towards high-riding SUVs, making the Superb’s more conventional body style stand out from the crowd. It’s a bit like sticking with your iPod while everyone else is streaming through Spotify. Just because most others have gone in a different direction doesn’t mean there isn’t value in sticking with the left-field choice. There's so much value in it, in fact, that the Superb won top spot in the Comfortable Cruiser category of the 2025 Carwow Car of the Year awards. If you go back 10 years or so there were loads of large family cars to choose from such as the Ford Mondeo, Mazda 6, Kia Optima and Hyundai i40. These have all disappeared from the showrooms now leaving just the Peugeot 508 and Volkswagen Passat to sit alongside the Superb - although the latter is only available as an estate. You could also consider a BMW 3 Series or the new Audi A5. What the Superb has over all of these alternatives is cavernous practicality, something Skoda has something of a reputation for. This is mainly down to the massive 645-litre boot, making it more spacious than all but the Passat estate. There’s loads of space in the rear seats as well, with acres of knee room and decent headroom. Getting three across the rear bench can be tricky because of the way the roof curves in, but it’s still doable for short journeys. The Superb hatchback also represents great value for money, as all Skodas should, but this isn’t at the expense of quality. It’s a lovely place to sit, with plenty of plush materials and solid build quality throughout. Sure, it's not quite as posh as an Audi or a BMW but it’s not far off. The Skoda Superb has one of the biggest boots in the business, and it’s a fantastic motorway cruiser as well Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer You get a 13.0-inch infotainment display as standard that has crisp graphics and responds quickly to your touch. Beneath this is a trio of dials with small screens within them, and their function can be altered intuitively so you’re not fiddling with touchscreen menus to change stuff like the climate settings on the move. Smart. The engine lineup is simple. You can choose between a 1.5-litre petrol or a 2.0-litre diesel engine - both of which have 150hp. Mid-spec cars are also available with a 193hp diesel with all-wheel drive, and range-topping models can be had with an all-wheel drive 265hp petrol engine. Regardless of which you choose, all models have a seven-speed automatic gearbox. Once you get out on the road you’ll immediately notice that the Superb is really easy to drive. Around town you have great visibility looking forwards, and there’s a good view out the back as well. The suspension is a little bit firmer over bumps than you might expect in a car like this, but it’s by no means uncomfortable. Head out onto a faster moving road and you get the sense that the Superb is set up for motorway mile munching. The suspension smooths out nicely at speed, and you get very little road or wind noise in the cabin. Go for the 150hp diesel and you’ll also get over 50mpg on a run with ease. Overall then the Skoda Superb makes a really solid case for the traditional family car, proving that SUVs aren’t necessarily the be-all and end-all for ferrying the kids around or carrying loads of stuff. It may not set your pulse racing, but the sheer versatility and value for money the Superb offers makes it hard to fault. If this sounds like the family car for you, then head over to our Skoda Superb deals pages to see how much you can save. If you fancy a used Superb then you can check out our used deals page, and you can also peruse other used Skoda models. Looking to change your car altogether?

fiat,general,"Is the Fiat 500 a good car? The Fiat 500 is perfectly suited to short urban commutes or popping into town. In the same way you wouldn’t wear a miniskirt and heels for climbing Mount Snowdon, and you wouldn’t wear tweeds and brogues to the beach, you wouldn’t buy a 500 for long cross-country schleps. The compact city car is something of a dying breed, but if you’re shopping for a Fiat 500 then you could also consider the Toyota Aygo X, Kia Picanto or the Renault Clio. The little Fiat has all these cars beaten on the style front though, offering a unique splash of retro chic. Things get even funkier inside, where the body-coloured dashboard and optional white steering wheel help lift the ambience nicely. The seats themselves aren’t the comfiest, but there’s plenty of adjustment to help you get a good view out and all the controls are grouped sensibly together so they’re a doddle to use. That said, the Fiat 500’s 7.0-inch touchscreen infotainment system takes a bit of getting used to thanks to the fiddly menus, but you can always use the standard-fit Apple CarPlay or Android Auto instead. Sadly, there isn’t much you can do about the Fiat 500’s cramped seats. Two adults in the front will be fine, but anyone close to six-feet tall will struggle for knee- and headroom in the back, and there isn’t a great deal of space in the Fiat 500’s boot for everyone’s luggage. The Fiat 500 is one of the most fun small cars around – not just for how it looks but also for the sheer number of characterful options you can choose from to make it your own Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer You probably won’t be packing the Fiat 500 with loads of bulky baggage though, will you? More likely you’ll be doing the school run, heading to work or popping to the shops. In these respects, it does a great job. Kids will have no trouble jumping into the back and the Fiat 500’s small size makes it just the thing for nipping through traffic and squeezing into tight parking spaces. Its 1.0-litre mild hybrid petrol engine is best suited to town driving as well, and it’s pretty economical. The great all-round visibility and light steering also help to make light work of tight car parks. Sure, it isn’t the most comfortable small car out there and it’s a bit noisy at speed, but it’ll tackle a twisty country road without much body lean and all models come with cruise control to help make the occasional motorway journey a bit more bearable. It’s just a shame that you can’t get the Fiat 500 with automatic emergency braking. However, you shouldn’t let this put you off if you’re looking for a seriously stylish city car that’s cheap to run, easy to drive and comes with plenty of personalisation options. See how much you can save on your next new car by heading over to our Fiat 500 deals page or browse the latest used Fiat 500s from our network of trusted dealers.

fiat,general,"Is the Fiat 500e a good car? This is the Fiat 500e, a city car with lovable retro-chic looks and an all-electric motor and battery – it's a bit like Greta Thunberg, because it's small and eco friendly. The 500e is a bit bigger and heavier than the petrol 500 that's also still on sale, but it still has diddy dimensions. If you're looking for a small EV there aren't many to choose from – but the Vauxhall Corsa Electric, BYD Dolphin and Peugeot e-208 are all great choices. Rather than add a bunch of fiddly details to the outside, Fiat’s gone back to basics and made the 500 look smoother, more rounded and even more minimalist than before. It’s like your grandad suddenly ditching the dyed comb-over and shaving his head instead. Smoother, simpler, cooler. For starters, the old car’s headlights have been ditched in favour of two semi-circular lamps with curved daytime-running lights that shine out through the bonnet. The flush door handles and hidden indicators are pretty much the only difference you’ll spot from the side, and the lack of an exhaust pipe is a dead giveaway that you’re looking at the new car from behind. OK, so the new Fiat 500e looks pretty similar to the old car on the outside, but it’s a totally different story inside. There’s a brand-new 7.0-inch digital dial display instead of traditional dials, and you get a big 10.25-inch touchscreen on the dashboard with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone mirroring. The physical controls for the heating and air conditioning are grouped together under the central touchscreen and there’s a storage tray where you’d find a gear lever in a petrol- or diesel-powered car. Space in the front is good for two adults and there are decent storage options, but the back seats cater for two only, and they’ll have to be quite small people at that. Fitting a child seat is pretty much impossible, too, while the 500’s boot is good for the weekly shop, but not much else. It is a city car, after all. With compact dimensions and an all-electric powertrain, the Fiat 500e is a superb city car option, even if the range won't take you too far out of it Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The Fiat 500e comes with two battery options – one that offers a 115-mile range and another with a 199-mile range, which isn't great when each of the other alternatives can go comfortably more than 200 miles in official tests. You can recharge your 500 using a three-pin socket, but that’ll take all night – literally. You’ll be better off getting a wallbox to take advantage of AC charging up to 11kW (or 7.4kW if that's the maximum you can get at your house), which will charge the battery in under three hours. The quickest way to charge is using a public fast charger, with the Fiat 500 capable of taking up to 85kW. At these speeds it can go from empty to 80% charged in 35 minutes, and add a useful 30 miles of charge in just five minutes. The Fiat 500 comes with either a 95hp motor that can hustle it from 0-62mph in 9.5 seconds, or a 118hp electric motor with enough poke to accelerate it from 0-62mph in nine seconds. That doesn’t sound particularly fast but the new 500 will do 0-30mph in three seconds, which is nippy in town and faster than most small city cars. Also handy in town is the new 500’s automatic emergency braking that’ll spot pedestrians and cyclists in your path and automatically apply the brakes if it thinks you’re about to hit them. That’s in addition to adaptive cruise control that’ll accelerate and brake for you on motorways to keep you a safe distance from the car ahead. There are three driving modes, Normal, Range and Sherpa. Range mode uses the motor to recharge the batteries when you brake to help boost the Fiat 500’s range, while Normal model tones down this ‘regenerative braking’ effect. The Sherpa function limits the 500’s top speed to 50mph (down from 93mph) and turns off the air conditioning. These extreme measures will be useful in an emergency when you really need to eke out every last mile to reach a charging point. So, the Fiat 500 is now an electric city car, but we think you’ll agree it’s a good one, provided you don’t need lots of space or expect the last word in interior quality. If you just love the looks, head to our Fiat 500e deals page. If you'd like a used Fiat 500 then head over to our used 500e deals.

fiat,general,"Is the Fiat 500X a good car? The Fiat 500X isn’t a bad choice if you’re looking for a small, stylish SUV and find yourself put off by the bland looks of the SEAT Arona or the stodgy drive offered by the Citroen C3 Aircross. The 500X was launched in 2014 and – to help it keep pace with the SEAT and Citroen – got a facelift in 2018. Changes included an updated interior, a new infotainment system, extra safety kit and a couple of new petrol engines. The diesels from the old model have been dropped. In terms of exterior styling, only the lights have changed – you now get new daytime running lights and rear LEDs – so you’ll struggle to tell the difference between the old car and this 2018 model. You can also choose from two exterior (rather optimistically coined) ‘body styles’ – Urban Look, which has conventional body coloured bumpers or Cross Look which has chunkier bumpers with mock skid plates. The interior gets the same retro look as the outside, the large swathe of body-coloured plastic that runs across the dashboard gives the 500X a playful feel that’s missing from the dingy SEAT Arona. But, while the 2018 500X gets a new instrument binnacle and a new steering wheel, its interior plastics look cheap in places, particularly in the back, and its switches and buttons are a little flimsy. The 500X looks like a cutesy Fiat 500 that's been blown up like a balloon and given a pair of extra doors Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The infotainment system has also been updated but doesn’t have the clear graphics or ease of use you get in the SEAT’s system. You do, however, get Apple CarPlay and Android Auto as standard in the Fiat, so it is easy to use your smartphone’s apps on the car’s 7.0-inch screen. Up front, there’s plenty of space to get comfy even if you’re tall and someone of a similar size should be able to squeeze behind you, too. The Fiat has a slightly smaller boot than its aforementioned alternatives, but it is easy to load and has space for a couple of large suitcases. Filled to the brim with people and stuff, the 500X’s otherwise nippy 120hp petrol engine isn’t going to feel quick, but it’s still the engine to go for because the quicker 150hp 1.3-litre model’s standard automatic gearbox is frustratingly slow to change which blunts acceleration. It’s a shame the more powerful engine is spoiled because there’s not much wrong with the way the 500X drives. In town, you can zip in and out of gaps in traffic, while at faster speeds there’s not too much body lean to worry about and the Fiat’s weighty steering makes it easy to place in bends. On the motorway, the suspension smooths out bumps better than it does at slower speeds, although the cabin does suffer from a fair amount of wind noise.

fiat,general,"Is the Fiat 600 a good car? The Fiat 600 is a bit like a designer handbag you buy because of its stylish looks, but when you get it home you find you can barely fit anything inside. That’s because while the 600’s retro-inspired looks will certainly turn heads, alternatives are much more spacious. And there are alternatives aplenty, from the chic Renault Captur to the rugged Dacia Duster, smart Volkswagen T-Cross and ultra-efficient Toyota Yaris Cross. You could even consider the bigger, plug-in hybrid MG HS, which isn’t a great leap in price. Yet while most of those cars look good in their own way, none is quite as funky as the 600. Sure, it’s not as effortlessly cool as the smaller Fiat 500, but it’s not a bad effort and wears its curves well. That curvy theme continues inside, with a large oval dashboard that, on the base trim, is painted the same shade as the exterior, which works particularly well if you opt for one of the brighter colours. However, there are cheap materials aplenty, and the floppy cover for the central storage bin is just… odd. Space is pretty good for those in the front though, with plenty of places to store bits and bobs, but that’s where the practicality ends. The rear seats are tight and the boot, at 385 litres is smaller than most alternatives offer. The Captur offers up to a massive 616 litres if you slide the rear seats forward. Alternatives offer more space, but if you’re looking for a slightly roomier upgrade from the 500 then the 600 is an intriguing option Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The infotainment system has sharp enough graphics, but navigating its menus and finding various settings is unintuitive. You can at least bypass most of this with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, which come as standard – and you’ll need to in the base model, because there’s no built-in navigation. Although Fiat markets the 600 engine as a ‘hybrid’, neither of the two engine choices are a proper self-charging or plug-in unit, so you won’t be cruising around town on electric power watching your MPGs skyrocket. However, it’s very effective at engaging electricity at lower speeds or when decelerating, so it’s relatively efficient – 50mpg is achievable – and smooth to drive around town. If all-electric motoring appeals you might consider the Fiat 600e instead. The diminutive footprint might not be great for space but it does mean the 600 is a doddle to drive in the city, particularly if you’re stepping up from the smaller 500. The suspension handles bumps well even at higher speeds, meaning motorway trips are nothing to fear. It’s anything but exciting to drive, though.

fiat,general,"Is the Fiat 500L a good car? The 500L is Fiat’s attempt at injecting a little style and character into the small multi-purpose vehicle (MPV) market, and it would certainly stand out parked between the equivalent Ford or Vauxhall.

fiat,general,"Is the Fiat Panda a good car? It might not have the retro looks of the Fiat 500, but the Panda is stylish. Its upright body means there’s plenty of room inside and all models come with five doors for great access. Interior quality might not be up to the standards of a Volkswagen Up, but it’s fair to say that Fiat has harnessed a decent amount of charm. The Panda feels at its best in the city, where its small dimensions make it perfect for weaving through congested streets and squeezing into tight parking spaces. Small engines mean the Panda is also cheap to run, but not best-suited to fast-moving motorway traffic, where it can feel a little out of breath. There are two body styles available. The first is the regular Panda, which is available on the base trim and looks like a typical city car. You also have the Cross, which can be found on the three other trims, called Red, Garmin and Top. This has some extra body cladding and other rugged-looking features that give it some baby off-roader style. The Fiat Panda is a quirky small car that's affordable but above all else fun Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Pandas are cheap cars, which means standard equipment is pretty basic and includes items such as central locking, six airbags, a CD player and power steering that can be lightened at the touch of a button. Overall, the Fiat Panda is a charming and well-sorted small car that has plenty of appealing traits. The space on offer is quite impressive for such tiny dimensions, it’s cheap to buy and run and is abundant in style and character. There are a few rough edges here and there, and rivals such as the Kia Picanto and Volkswagen Up are very tempting alternatives to the funky Fiat. However, the Panda has a lot going for it, and is a much more capable all-rounder than the alternatives. It’s definitely worth considering if you’re in the market for such a car, so why not check out our Fiat Panda deals to see how much you could save?

fiat,general,"Is the Fiat Panda Cross a good car? The Fiat Panda Cross is a chunky little hatchback that could be your ideal compact off-roader if you fancy something small and easy to drive but live somewhere prone to bouts of harsh winter weather. Unlike the Suzuki Jimny, the Fiat Panda Cross isn’t a thoroughbred 4×4 – as its name suggests, it’s based on the humble Panda hatchback. Peel away the Cross’ angrier bodywork, however, and you’ll find a neat four-wheel-drive system that means it’ll keep up with the Suzuki long after many more expensive SUVs have got themselves well and truly stuck. Its huge plastic bumpers and silver door protectors aren’t just for show, either – they’ll help make sure the Fiat Panda Cross’ bodywork springs back into shape should you have an altercation with a particularly solid piece of the countryside. It even comes with two tow hooks front and back so you can use the Panda’s off-road prowess to rescue other motorists caught in a sudden snowstorm – if you feel like it, that is. This rugged utilitarian theme continues in the Fiat Panda Cross’ cabin – only here it’s less appealing. Sure, the square instruments look pretty funky and the contrasting silver slab and copper-effect dashboard add a splash of colour, but the plastics all feel hard and scratchy and you don’t get a great deal of equipment as standard. The Fiat Panda Cross is fun little 4x4 that’ll plug its way through terrain that’d see many bigger SUVs stranded but, if you’ll just use it to potter around town, get a standard Panda Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer So, it might not feel all that plush inside, but at least the Fiat Panda Cross’ cabin is pretty roomy. There’s loads of headroom in the front (although a height-adjustable driver’s seat doesn’t come as standard on entry-level cars) and three kids will have plenty of space to stretch out in the back. A Dacia Duster as more space for tall adults, though, as well as a more practical boot than the diminutive Fiat Panda Cross. The Dacia’s engines aren’t quite as economical as the Fiat’s, though. You can get the Panda Cross with either a city-friendly 0.9-litre two-cylinder petrol or a more powerful 1.2-litre four-cylinder that’ll be better if you plan on doing long motorway journeys or any kind of serious off-roading. If you plan to stick to the asphalt, though, you’ll find the Fiat Panda Cross feels very similar to the standard Panda – that’s to say it’s a doddle to manoeuvre in town, easy to park and even reasonably comfortable. It’s not particularly spritely – whichever engine you pick – and it leans a fair amount in tight corners, though not enough to make passengers feel ill. What it lacks, though, is any kind of advanced safety kit, such as the automatic emergency braking feature you get in a Suzuki Jimny. That being said, the more affordable Fiat is still a charming compact off-roader that’s well worth a second look.

fiat,general,"Is the Fiat Panda 4x4 a good car? The Fiat Panda 4×4 is a compact city car that’ll take the odd off-road excursion in its stride. It’s just as easy to live with as the standard Panda but comes with a grippy four-wheel-drive system that makes it a worthy alternative to the likes of the Suzuki Jimny and Dacia Duster 4×4. Inside, however, the Fiat Panda 4×4 comes with a much more stylish cabin than the unapologetically basic Suzuki. The dials, heating controls and even the centre of the steering wheel come with a squared-off circular design (should that be squircular?) and you can choose from a selection of camouflage olive, beige and brown trims for the dashboard. Less worthy of praise, however, is the Fiat Panda 4×4’s infotainment system. Rather than a slick touchscreen like you get as standard in many other small SUVs (including the Suzuki Jimny) you’ll have to make do with a back-to-basics stereo and CD player with an old-fashioned orange and black display. Fiat’s UConnect app lets you use some of your smartphone’s features while you’re driving, but it’s nowhere near as intuitive as the more commonplace Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone mirroring systems you’ll find in many alternatives. So, the Fiat Panda 4×4 doesn’t have a particularly high-tech cabin, but at least it’s relatively spacious for such a small car. Its tall body means there’s enough headroom in both the front and rear seats for adults to get comfy, but those in the back will be left wishing there was slightly more leg room – especially on long journeys. It’s a similar story when you take a look at the Fiat Panda 4×4’s boot. Its 225-litre capacity is big enough for a weekly shop but significantly smaller than the space you get in the likes of the less off-road focussed SEAT Arona and Renault Captur. Unlike most so-called off-roaders, the Fiat Panda 4x4 is perfectly capable of hauling you and three friends over deeply rutted fields and up snowy hills without breaking a sweat Mat Watson Carwow expert Also smaller than in many alternatives is the Fiat Panda 4×4’s diminutive 0.9-litre petrol engine. It might only have two cylinders, but it packs a fairly decent 85hp punch so it doesn’t feel too sluggish. It’ll accelerate from 0-62mph in a reasonable 12.1sec, and Fiat claims it’ll return 57.6mpg – although you’ll probably see a figure closer to 45mpg in normal driving conditions. There’s also a 1.3-litre diesel you should consider if you do lots of motorway miles. It’s not as fast as the petrol, but it uses less fuel and it’s slightly quieter when you’re cruising along. Not that the Fiat Panda 4×4 feels particularly at home whizzing along at 70mph, that is. It’s much more adept nipping through town where its small size and relatively large windows make it a doddle to manoeuvre and easier to park than the larger Dacia Duster. The Fiat Panda 4×4 is pretty comfortable to drive over poorly maintained roads, too, and it doesn’t lean a great deal in tight corners – despite its jacked-up suspension that makes it taller than the standard Panda. Head off-road, and the Fiat Panda 4×4’s special tyres and four-wheel drive mean it’ll happily traipse through mud that’d leave most two-wheel-drive SUVs well and truly stuck. It doesn’t have quite the same boulder-traversing abilities as the Suzuki Jimny, but it’ll prove more than capable of dealing with a few inches of snow or a heavily rutted field. Unfortunately, the Fiat Panda 4×4 there is a fly in the ointment The Panda Cross – with which the 4×4 shares many components – earned a mediocre three-star safety rating when it was crash-tested by Euro NCAP in 2015. If, however, you’re looking for a cheap, cheerful 4×4 that won’t cost the earth to run you should still consider the Fiat Panda 4×4 – especially if you actually plan to use it off-road.",,Carwow
fiat,general,"Is the Fiat 600e a good car? The Fiat 500e is a great city car, but what if you need a bit more space? Step forward the Fiat 600e - the Italian firm’s small, fully-electric SUV. It captures some of the charm and style that’s made the 500 so popular, but stretches it across a bigger body with much more interior room and - importantly - five doors. Think of it like the 500’s older sibling. It’s not quite as cute to look at as the baby of the family, and might not get as much attention - but it’s a lot more useful when you need a helping hand. The 600e may be bigger than the 500 but it’s still pretty small by SUV standards. Compared with alternatives such as the Peugeot e-2008, MG ZS EV or Carwow Car of the Year-winning Volvo EX30, it’s quite a bit smaller. It’s more like a jacked-up hatchback, having a similar footprint but higher roofline than cars such as the Vauxhall Corsa Electric. Those tiny dimensions mean the 600e is fantastic for driving and parking in cramped towns and cities, and if you’re upgrading from a 500 it won’t feel intimidating or too bulky. Despite this, interior space is pretty good. The front seats have loads of room, and while the back seats are a bit too cramped for adults to get very comfortable they’re plenty spacious enough for a couple of child seats. Fiat 600e: electric range, battery and charging data Range: 254 milesEfficiency: 4.7mi/kWhBattery size: 54kWhMax charge speed: 100kWCharge time AC: 7hrs 45 mins, 7kWCharge time DC: 27 mins, 20-80%, 100kWCharge port location: Rear leftPower outputs: 154hp You do pay for that with the boot space, however, which at 360 litres is larger than most electric hatchbacks but smaller than just about every other comparable electric SUV. Inside, there’s quite a lot to like. The 600e shares many of its components with its close sibling, the Jeep Avenger Electric, but adds in a dose of Italian style familiar to those who’ve sat in a 500. There’s a swooping shape to the dashboard and some shiny trim, plus a pleasing round housing over the instrument cluster. It’s quite a trim-dependent interior, though, with posh La Prima cars getting light-coloured upholstery and trim that really lifts the cabin - while the darker trim of entry-level cars looks and feels a little cheap. There’s plenty of storage space with big door bins and adjustable cupholders, but the fabric flap that covers the central storage bin is just plain annoying. The infotainment system is Fiat’s latest, and it’s based on a very wide but quite shallow display. It can be a bit awkward to use, and a little jerky to flick between menus - but the screen itself is high-res and the wireless smartphone connectivity works perfectly well, allowing you to bypass Fiat’s own system if you want to. The Fiat 600e is a characterful electric SUV that's great to drive in the city – and it's good value, too Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer There’s also a nice set of physical climate controls, which is much easier to operate on the move than having to head into a display sub-menu just to adjust the temperature. On the road, the 600e is genuinely impressive especially considering its price. It soaks up bumps as well as any of its alternatives, and can make some much more expensive cars feel positively uncomfortable in comparison. Dealing effortlessly with speed bumps and bad roads, plus super-light steering and good visibility means the Fiat 600e is a fantastic EV to drive around town. It’s comfortable on longer trips, too, though it doesn’t feel quite as stable and tied down as some alternatives and there’s a bit more noise on the motorway. The 600e is available with just one motor and battery option at the moment. It officially offers 254 miles of range from a pretty modest battery capacity, and in our tests it proved impressively efficient - resulting in a real-world range of about 200 miles. Public charging from 20-80% takes less than half an hour, which is par for the course. If you’re not ready to make the switch to electric just yet, there's also a hybrid 600. So the Fiat 600e is a decent small electric SUV overall – it’s a bit cheap inside and not hugely practical, but it’s packed full of character and is comfortable to drive around town. It’s priced temptingly, too. Interested? Check out the latest Fiat 600e deals available through Carwow.

fiat,general,"Is the Fiat Tipo a good car? The Fiat Tipo is available with a choice of two petrol and two diesel engines in five different power outputs. The entry-level 1.3-litre diesel model comes with a five-speed manual gearbox while larger engines benefit from a six-speed manual. A six-speed automatic gearbox is offered on 1.6-litre petrol and diesel cars and Fiat has announced a dual-clutch version will be available in the near future. Its interior is a departure from the retro-inspired Fiat 500 range and focuses instead on basic functionality and occupant comfort. The rear seats have an impressive amount of legroom and the tall rear roofline provides decent headroom. As a result, three six-foot tall passengers can sit in the back for shorter journeys. Standard equipment on entry-level cars might disappoint some customers although a seven-inch touchscreen infotainment system with Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and sat nav is available on higher-spec models. The 440-litre boot is more spacious than those in the Nissan Pulsar (350 litres) and Renault Megane (384 litres) but lags behind the Skoda Octavia's capacious 600-litre load bay. The rear seat bases can be flipped forward allowing the seat backs to be folded completely flat and the lack of discernible load lip makes loading heavy or bulky items easy, too. The Tipo is a reasonably priced car that needs more than that to be competitive in this end of the market Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The Fiat Tipo does a good job of blending cheap running costs with impressive practicality and a reasonably refined ride in a distinctive and sharply-styled package. The selection of engines on offer might be sparing, but two efficient diesels and a number of rev-happy petrols should mean there’s a Tipo to suit the needs of most potential customers.

fiat,general,"Is the Fiat Qubo a good car? The Fiat Qubo is a small MPV with a roomy interior and a very practical boot. If you’re searching for a bigger alternative to a small hatchback and don’t fancy an SUV, this funky-looking, boxy car could be the answer. If the Fiat Qubo will likely remind you of a small van with windows, that’ll be because it uses plenty of the same mechanical bits and bobs as the Italian firm’s smallest commercial vehicle. As a result, it doesn’t have quite the same street-cred as an equally tall and boxy SUV, but you won’t have any trouble finding it in a crowded supermarket car park. The Fiat Qubo’s interior carries on the theme set out by its boxy exterior. The dashboard is pretty plain, save for a few silver plastic panels, but at least the knobs for the heating and the buttons for the stereo are easy to reach. It doesn’t feel as plush or as solid as many similarly priced hatchbacks, however, and you can’t add any colour to the Qubo’s pretty drab interior with any posher trims or colourful inserts. Almost every surface feels hard and brittle too, but at least you get a rubber floor as standard which is a doddle to keep clean. This form-over-function approach runs right the way through the Fiat Qubo’s cabin. There are acres of headroom, the front doors open nice and wide and the back doors slide rather than swing open so it’s easy for passengers to climb in – even in tight parking spaces. If you’re looking for an unashamedly practical box on wheels, the budget-minded Fiat Qubo makes a good choice. Just don’t expect it to win any admiring glances… Mat Watson Carwow expert Once inside, they’ll find there’s loads of legroom to stretch out – even if they’re tall and sit behind a six-foot driver. The three back seats are all equally wide so you can carry three adults at once without anyone fighting over who has to sit in the middle seat. If no-one’s tagging along for the ride you can flip the back seats forward and use the Fiat Qubo to carry absolutely masses of luggage. The boot’s wide and square and comes without any kind of load lip so it’s dead easy to slide in some heavy furniture. You can even fold the front passenger seat forward to carry really long items. With the back seats in place, the Qubo can carry about the same amount as a small family hatchback such as the Skoda Fabia. Speaking of which, the Fiat Qubo feels remarkably like a conventional hatchback to drive – despite its boxy shape and tall body. Sure, you’d never call it fun, but it irons out bumps reasonably well around town and doesn’t lean excessively on twisty roads. You can get the Fiat Qubo with one petrol and one diesel engine. Neither are particularly gutsy, but the latter’s your best bet if you spend any length of time on the motorway while the petrol will suit inner-city drivers better. You can’t get the Qubo with any particularly clever safety feature like you can in most small hatchbacks or SUVs, but when it comes to outright load-carrying ability, this quirky van-based MPV offers decent value for money. Check out our Fiat Qubo deals to see how much you can save on one.",,Carwow
fiat,general,"Is the Fiat 500C a good car? Inspired by ‘La Dolce Vita’ of warm days in Tuscany or Rome, the Fiat 500C is a convertible small car that has a sliding soft-top and wonderfully retro styling. With only the Mini Convertible and Toyota Aygo X (when it's fitted with a sliding roof) the only true alternatives, the 500C is part of a rare breed – but it’s not going the way of the dodo just yet, with the 500 Electric Convertible taking up the zero-emission mantle. Its style is classic Fiat, with plenty of chrome trim around the main badge and lights matching the throwback looks. The short overhangs, which make it great in town, are matched with more chrome around the back, which has rectangular lights and shows the full extent of the sliding roof. Inside, most of the dashboard features a body-coloured panel to match the outside. That hosts the 7.0-inch touchscreen, the climate controls and a high-mounted gear lever. The steering wheel sits in front of the speedometer, which has the rev counter inside it as well as a small driver information display, which isn’t easy to navigate. Top versions get a 7.0-inch screen behind the wheel, although that isn’t the simplest to use either. You won’t find a lot of cabin space in the 500C. Yes, the driver can get comfortable fairly easily, but if you’re tall you won’t find masses of headroom available. Trying to squeeze adults into the back is very tricky, as you have to fold the front seat forward, then clamber into a space where you’ll find little room. It’s worth splashing the cash and getting the Fiat 500C Top if you want this cute and stylish supermini – even if it’s not the best to live with Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The boot isn’t particularly large either. At 185 litres, it seriously lags behind the boot in the Mini Convertible and Toyota Aygo X, while multiple other small cars top that if you’re not desperate for the sliding roof. Folding the back seats down does open more space, but the boot opening itself is too narrow to fit larger items in. You only get one engine choice with the 500C – a 70hp 1.0-litre three-cylinder petrol engine with a small generator and battery applied to help with fuel economy. That comes with a six-speed manual transmission. The sprint from 0-60mph is more of a jog, taking 13.8 seconds. In town, the keenly revving engine helps you get up to urban speeds quickly enough, while the light steering can be made even lighter by pressing a button on the centre console to make the Fiat more manoeuvrable. The 500C is comfortable enough over bumps and you get a good view around you, but the rear view can be hindered with the roof rolled down. That tiny engine does start to run out of puff when you’re on the motorway though. As it takes so long to get up to speed, you have to make the most out of every gear by revving it close to the red line. It is also quite noisy at higher speeds, with wind and road noise glaringly obvious. If you’re in an Abarth 695C – a tricked-out Fiat 500 – twisty roads are a lot of fun. Not so much in the Fiat 500C. You feel like you might topple over if you take a corner too quickly, and the steering does not give you a great sense of how much grip your front tyres have. While the Fiat 500C offers a lot for those wanting to enjoy sunnier weather when driving around town, there are sacrifices that need to be made –. it’s not that practical for its size and isn’t refined when you need to go on a longer journey, with a Mini Convertible or Toyota Aygo X being more accomplished overall. If you want to see the best new deals on a Fiat 500C, check out carwow, where you can find used FIat 500C offers as well.

bmw,general,"Is the BMW 1 Series a good car? The BMW 1 Series is a posh family hatchback with a high-quality cabin and loads of cutting-edge tech. You may also be considering the Audi A3 or Mercedes A-Class if you’re shopping for a premium hatchback, and the 1 Series was updated in 2024 with a new look and an updated cabin. The 1 Series has always been the go-to if you want a premium hatchback with a sporty edge. It’s a bit like choosing a pair of Yeezys over some Dr. Marten loafers. There are very few small cars which feel as posh inside as the BMW 1 Series, and this was only improved during the 2024 update. All the materials feel soft and yielding and everything is really solid. Quality in here is much better than it is in a Mercedes A-Class. The tech you get inside is also really impressive. All cars get a huge curved display atop the dashboard comprising a 10.7-inch touchscreen and a 10.3-inch digital driver’s display, and it’s all very responsive and easy to use. Watch: BMW M135 review As is the case in most BMWs the driving position is spot on. There’s loads of adjustment in the seats and steering wheel for all drivers big and small to get comfortable. Once you’re ready to go, there are also plenty of cubby holes for you to empty your pockets into. Moving to the rear seats, the space on offer is best described as adequate. If you’re only carrying two people back there then they’ll have enough legroom, however headroom could be a struggle for taller adults. Getting three people back there is also a tight squeeze, and a Volkswagen Golf is more adept at carrying rear passengers. Boot space is also down on some of this car's key competitors. In the basic petrol model you get significantly less space than an Audi A3 or Honda Civic have to offer, however the BMW’s load area is a nice square shape and there isn’t much of a lip to haul items over. As for engines, there are just three on offer and they’re all petrol-powered. Entry-level models get a 1.5-litre three-cylinder with 170hp, then there’s a 2.0-litre with 218hp or the range-topping M135 hot hatchback with 300hp and all-wheel drive. The 1 Series really is a good, premium-feeling small car, it’s just a little bit expensive Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Once you’ve loaded the car up and hit the road, the first thing you’ll notice is that even the entry-level petrol model has a hot hatch feel to it. The steering is responsive and it’s great fun to thread down a country road, though the performance-focused M135 isn't as exciting as the Volkswagen Golf R, even if there's no denying it's fast in a straight line. The sportiness does come at the expense of comfort though, because even the normal 1 Series is a bit firmer than an Audi A3. This is especially apparent around town, where the car jitters around over potholes and broken surfaces. Still, at least the steering is nice and light and you get decent all-round visibility. Things settle down on the motorway, where the cabin feels nice and hushed. There’s just a hint of tyre roar disturbing the peace, but the 1 Series is a relaxing car for covering long distances. So the BMW 1 Series is great to drive, packed with tech and really well-made. Some alternatives are more comfortable though, and quite a lot of features are pricey options. Check out the latest BMW 1 Series deals if you fancy this as your next car and want to save some cash, or browse offers on other BMW models.

bmw,general,"Is the BMW 2 Series Active Tourer a good car? Crossovers and SUVs dominate the family car market these days, however BMW is keen to prove that the humble MPV is still deserving of a place on the driveway with the 2 Series Active Tourer. You can think of the 2 Series Active Tourer as a more sensible alternative to cars like the Audi Q2 and Mercedes GLA, and BMW’s own X1. If those cars were a pair of trendy Nike Air Max trainers, the 2 Series Active Tourer is a sensible pair of Hush Puppies. In terms of premium people carriers, only Mercedes offers something similar, with the B-Class very much in the same mould as the Active Tourer - practical rather than fashionable for the size. It may not be as stylish as a modern SUV, but you can lift the 2 Series Active Tourer by going for the M Sport pack. This gives the car some sporty-looking bumpers, as well as 18-inch alloy wheels, making it look a bit less dowdy and a bit more aggressive. This may not hide the car’s boxy shape, but the plus side is a practical cabin. Up-front there’s plenty of headroom, as well as loads of adjustment in the seats to find your ideal driving position. You get plenty of storage, with a small cubby under the armrest as well as a big space under the centre console where you could keep a bag. The glovebox is an average size, as are the door bins. You can get a wireless charging pad in front of the cupholders, which has a helpful clip to keep your phone in place. The spacious theme continues in the rear. Headroom is still generous, and there’s plenty of knee room as well. There’s also a handy armrest with cupholders in the rear, and fitting a child seat is easy thanks to the exposed ISOFIX anchor points. As for the boot, you get 470 litres of space in the 218d models, or 415 litres in the 220i and 223i versions. Plug-in hybrid versions drop to 406 litres of cargo room thanks to a battery pack under the floor, although that’s still around the same as the 405 litres offered by the Audi Q2. The 2 Series Active Tourer may not be as stylish as an SUV, but it offers plenty of practicality and a really nice interior Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The Mercedes B-Class gets 420 litres of boot space, so slightly more than the petrol and plug-in hybrid Active Tourer, but less than you get in the 218d version. It’s worth bearing in mind however that the diesel’s additional storage space is situated under the boot floor., rather than within the main luggage area The exterior design may not be as exciting as an SUV, however the interior can easily match something like a Mercedes GLA. Everything feels really well screwed together, and the materials used are all high-quality. The overall cabin layout is very similar to the BMW X1 SUV, meaning you get the same floating armrest and wide central air vent, as well as the same 10.25-inch digital driver’s display and 10.7-inch infotainment system. Engine-wise, there are plenty to choose from. Only one of them is diesel though, the 218d with 150hp. Then there’s a couple of petrol models, the 220i and the 223i with 170hp and 218hp respectively. If you’re a company car driver, you’ll probably be looking at the tax-efficient 225e plug-in hybrid. This gets a 1.5-litre petrol engine paired with an electric motor, producing 245hp and capable of an official 56 miles on electric power alone. The plug-in hybrid makes the most sense around town, where the instant acceleration of the electric motor makes pulling out at busy junctions easy. Whichever engine you go for though, the 2 Series Active Tourer is easy to drive in the urban jungle. The BMW 2 Series Active Tourer may not be the most exciting offering in the family car segment, however if you’re looking for a well-made, premium-feeling car to haul the family around, and you’re not too bothered about looking flash while doing it, this car is certainly worth a look-in.

bmw,general,"Is the BMW 3 Series a good car? The BMW 3 Series is like Alan Shearer. No, it’s not from Newcastle, but like Shearer it has for generations been a reliable and impressive performer, able to out-shine European and world opposition at the highest level, and is still going strong even in its advancing years. While Audi might be re-inventing the A4 as the new A5 (rather confusingly) and Mercedes has brought out a new C-Class while BMW was just updating the 3 Series, this is still a car that looks and feels totally cutting edge, especially in how it drives. Though if you would also consider an electric car, the Tesla Model 3 feels more futuristic still. In terms of styling, the most recent round of updates for the 3 Series haven’t changed that much. There’s been some small nipping and tucking around the lights and grille, some new wheels and paint options, but the overall shape and style remains the same. That’s both good and bad — good in that, overall, the 3 Series is still a handsome thing. Bad in that it hasn’t addressed some design mis-steps, such as the way the 3 looks overly bulky around the rear wheelarches. Basic Sport models get chrome trim around the radiator grille, while M-Sport models look a little more glowering with blacked-out trim. Watch: Audi A4 v BMW 3 Series v Genesis G70 v Mercedes C-Class It’s in the cabin that you’ll find the bigger changes. BMW has binned the (rather attractive) separate digital instruments and infotainment screen in favour of the big, curved, combined screen setup taken from other models such as the 4 Series and 5 Series. This means that the 3 Series now has the latest and most up to date infotainment software — which can update itself via over-the-air links — but even though the old iDrive click-wheel has been retained, there are some fiddly bits to find your way around on the screens, and the graphics don’t look quite as nice as they used to. Space in the cabin remains unchanged, which means you get just enough for four adults to sit in reasonable comfort, but there’s not the stretch-out space you’d find elsewhere. The boot is practical, especially in the Touring estate, but remember that the plug-in hybrid 330e — a hugely popular model with business user-choosers — loses quite a lot of that space to the battery, to the point where a basic VW Golf hatchback has a bigger boot. Not that you’ll care about boot space much when you’re sitting up in the driver’s seat. The BMW 3 Series has long been considered the best of its breed to drive, and that hasn’t changed, despite the fact it’s bigger and heavier now than it has ever been. While we have to wait to see what Audi has cooked up with the new A5 saloon, the 3 Series most definitely has the beating of the otherwise-impressive Mercedes C-Class when it comes to the driving experience. This is still a car that looks and feels totally cutting edge, especially in the way it drives Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The engine range has shrunk somewhat in the past few years — your choice at the base of the BMW 3 Series lineup is now restricted to the petrol 320i or the plug-in hybrid 330e. Bye-bye diesel 320d — we shall miss your combo of easy-going performance and exceptional economy, though there are plenty of excellent used examples to be found. In fact, there are now no diesel 3 Series models at all, something of a shock when you remember how wildly successful they have been over the years. Mind you, the 330e looks like it might be settling into the 320d’s economy shoes, not least because a big battery upgrade now means that it can do as much as 62 miles on electric power alone, if you remember to charge up the battery (which can’t, alas, be fast-charged from public DC chargers). Of course, if it’s serious performance you want — but you don’t fancy the expense and insurance cost of stepping up to a full-on M3 — there’s the brilliant M340i with its 374hp, straight-six, 3.0-litre turbo engine. Whisper it, but that’s actually a more enjoyable car to drive even than the mighty M3 itself. If you want to bag yourself a great deal, check out Carwow’s BMW 3 Series deals.

bmw,general,"Is the BMW 4 Series a good car? The BMW 4 Series is an upmarket coupe that seats four and is designed to be more stylish and fun to drive than the BMW 3 Series saloon on which it’s based. It’s also more fun than its main alternatives, the Audi A5 and Mercedes C-Class Coupe. The two-door 4 Series Coupe sits in a family of 4 Series models, along with the convertible and five-door Gran Coupe models, while the BMW i4 is the electric version of the regular 4 Series Coupe, with the coupe and convertible getting updates in 2024. But in terms of styling, if the German coupes were in an orchestra, the Audi and Mercedes would be tickling the triangle while the BMW tries its best on the tuba – that grille makes the most noise. Some will like it and some really won’t. Still, beyond that, the 4 Series is a good looking car. Its aggressive creases, sporty body kit and sloping roofline make it a sort of half-price BMW 8 Series. Inside, it’s not as in-your-face as a C-Class in terms of design, but it’s classier and the levels of quality are better than in both Mercedes and Audi. In Mercedes’ larger cars its infotainment system narrowly beats BMW’s for visual drama and the way it works, but in the 4 Series and C-Class (where Mercedes fits its older systems), it’s the BMW that takes the win. The BMW’s looks better, works better and comes with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Praise be. Audi’s system comes a close third on all fronts. The range-topping M440i is brilliant, but most people will love the 420i M Sport. Head to our deals page for the very best prices! Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The 4 Series has seating for four people and those in the front seats will have all the space they need. The driver gets a good amount of adjustment, but it’s disappointing that lumbar adjustment – good for staying comfortable on long drives – isn’t standard and only comes as part of a very expensive pack. Grrr. The rear seats are fine for legroom, even for adults, but they’ll struggle with head room if they are anywhere close to six foot. Getting in and out of the back is a struggle too, because there are no rear doors – but hey, it’s a coupe. Still, the 4 Series’ boot is a generous 440 litres, which is only slightly smaller than an A5’s and some way bigger than the C-Class Coupe’s. There’s lots of engine choice, and there isn’t a bad one. There are 2.0-litre and 3.0-litre petrol and diesels, ranging from 184hp to 374hp, but the majority of people will find the 184hp 420i 2.0-litre petrol a great choice. Do more motorway miles? The 190hp 420d 2.0-litre diesel will cruise more efficiently. If you want maximum punch, the M440d diesel and M440i petrol both have powerful six-cylinder engines with startling performance. Then there’s the high-performance BMW M4, which we have reviewed separately. Handily, all 4 Series models are huge fun to drive. They’re lower and stiffer than a BMW 3 Series, and turn into corners with more agility than an A5 or C-Class Coupe. The xDrive all-wheel drive system is available with the 420d and standard on the M440 models for added security in slippery conditions, plus BMW offers things like upgraded brakes, a sports differential and adaptive suspension to really spice things up. The M models get this as standard. That agility does mean the 4 Series feels harder over bumps in town, even in its most comfortable driving mode, but otherwise, its standard parking sensors and rear camera make light work of parking. On the motorway, the suspension feels less abrupt and the 4 Series cruises quietly, but like the lumbar support, BMW’s clever adaptive cruise control with lane-keep steering assist costs a fortune to add as part of a pack. More grrr. Despite these minor setbacks, we think the 4 Series is the best of its breed. See how much you could save on a new BMW 4 Series with carwow, or check out our latest used BMWs.

bmw,general,"Is the BMW 5 Series a good car? Think of an all-rounder, and two things are likely to spring to mind. First will be a Swiss army knife – the global icon for ‘a thing that does everything’ – and the next could well be the BMW 5 Series. Since debuting five decades ago, this posh German saloon has proven time and again that it can offer comfort, bags of practicality, the latest technology and serious performance. It’s a similar story with its two key alternatives – if you’re considering a 5 Series you should also take a look at the Mercedes E-Class and Audi A6. Or perhaps the Lexus ES if you want a left-field option. The latest 5 Series clearly takes hints from BMW’s recent bold design direction as seen on the likes of the 2 Series Coupe and XM, albeit a little more subdued. That said, its styling is rather challenging, lacking the elegance of its predecessors. There are odd, incohesive lines around the headlights and front bumper, a front grille that seemingly mimics beaver teeth and the rear end looks like the designers couldn’t agree on what to do so gave up halfway through the process. Watch: All-electric BMW i5 review It’s a different story inside, with BMW’s latest infotainment system present and correct, combining a 12.3-inch digital drivers’ display with a 14.9-inch central screen. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are included as standard, and operate wirelessly. The overall design is pretty good and although some of the physical buttons have disappeared, forcing you to use the touchscreen more, there are high quality materials and solid build quality to make up for it. Artificial leather upholstery comes as standard, though you can opt for the real stuff, as well as a part-Alcantara choice if you’d prefer. So you get all the good tech, but if practicality is key, you might be a touch disappointed. Petrol-powered versions of the new 5 Series promise 520 litres of boot capacity, which is less than the Mercedes E-Class and Audi A6, though not by much. On the plus side, unlike those two cars the BMW’s boot doesn’t lose capacity in the plug-in hybrid version. A Touring estate version will arrive later if you need the extra room. The BMW 5 Series is available with one petrol engine, offering 208hp, and a pair of plug-in hybrid versions with up to 489hp. Notably, there’s no diesel version, which is a sign of the times given that this model is typically popular with those who rack up serious motorway mileage. The BMW 5 Series is comfortable to drive and has a lovely interior – shame the outside just looks so… bleugh Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer It’s goodbye to diesel, but hello to electric for the first time in a 5 Series. The i5 – reviewed separately here – will do up to 361 miles on a charge, but is quite a bit more expensive than the petrol-powered model. As you might expect, the BMW 5 Series is a comfortable and refined motorway cruiser. There’s a little bit of wind and road noise but overall it’s a relaxing way to rack up miles. However, BMWs usually excel at also being great fun on a twisty road, but the latest 5 Series is a bit disappointing in this regard. The steering is numb and doesn’t give much feedback about how much grip the tyres have, while the car just generally lacks the eagerness to turn into a corner that made old versions so much fun to drive. An Audi A6 is, surprisingly, more fun here… Regardless, this is a great all-rounder and just a fraction better overall than the Mercedes E-Class and Audi A6. Want one?

bmw,general,"Is the BMW 5 Series Touring a good car? The BMW 5 Series Touring is a posh estate car with a plug-in hybrid engine that makes it ideal as a practical family car, or for company car drivers looking for something comfortable to rack up miles in. It’s a bit like a Burberry backpack, because it’s posh and practical in equal measure. SUVs might be the on-trend choice, but there are plenty of estate alternatives to consider if you prefer to sit lower in the car. Other posh estates include the Audi A6 Avant and Mercedes E-Class Estate, or you could opt for a well-specced Volkswagen Passat. The 5 Series Touring isn’t the best-looking car, with odd angular lines in the bodywork that never feel quite as cohesive as more elegantly styled generations of old. Things get better inside, though, with a clean design for the most part. You get a smart piece of trim splitting the dashboard widthways and a pair of screens above this. BMW’s infotainment tech is some of the best in the business, with crisp displays and intuitive menu navigation. Aesthetically challenged on the outside, but the BMW 5 Series Touring should be a comfortable, practical estate car Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Boot space is up on the BMW 5 Series Saloon, increasing from that car’s 520 litres to 570 litres. Not a huge leap, but the more boxy shape should make it easier to load large items. It’s worth noting the Mercedes E-Class Estate has a roomier boot than this and the Audi A6 Avant, with the BMW’s boot the smallest of the trio. At launch, there’s just the one plug-in hybrid engine option. Called 530e, it combines a 2.0-litre petrol engine with an electric motor to make 184hp, while the battery provides a range of nearly 60 miles. This will be particularly appealing to company car drivers because of the favourable Benefit-in-Kind rate, though for the same reason the all-electric i5 Touring is also worth a look. Another plug-in hybrid, as well as a regular petrol engine, will join the line-up later. Although we’ve not been behind the wheel of this new model just yet, it’s likely to drive very much like the 5 Series Saloon. As such, you can expect a refined and comfortable car that’s at its best at motorway speeds, though perhaps not as much fun on a twisty road as its predecessors. If you’re interested in this car, find out how much you could save with Carwow’s BMW 5 Series Touring deals. You can also get a great price on a used 5 Series Touring, as well as other used BMW models. If you want to sell your car online, Carwow can help with that, too.",,Carwow
bmw,general,"Is the BMW 7 Series a good car? The BMW 7 Series is the flagship saloon of the German brand, and it showcases the latest tech that the firm has to offer. In this case, it’s got a fleet of improved technology inside, such as the optional cinema style screen in the back – like having your own private Odeon. But the main story with the 7 Series is its controversial new design. The large grille dominates the front, while it’s flanked by split headlights, which certainly divides opinion, but looks better in the metal. The sharp design continues down the side with some creases, but it’s slab-sided otherwise. At the rear it’s classic 7 Series with a modern twist. It’s pretty square but it gets thin lights to get that futuristic look. The all-electric BMW i7 that sits alongside the 7 Series gets blue highlights all round the vehicle, including on the rear bumper. Inside, you’ll find one of the fanciest cabins currently on sale. You get a huge panel containing both screens, one of which is the infotainment touchscreen that can be controlled by the iDrive dial. You also get loads of crystal detailing you may have seen in the BMW iX SUV, including a whole panel that lights up depending on different functions, such as the climate control. With luxury trimmings and excellent build quality, the 7 Series manages to be as accomplished as a Mercedes S-Class. It’s not quite as luxurious as the electric i7 though. The rear seats are like you’re on a business class flight, and you can get seats that recline to give a properly relaxing experience. You get touchscreen displays to control the optional widescreen that folds down from the roof, as well as the seats and air conditioning. It’s high-end limousine luxury at its finest. Out on the road, the 7 Series feels super composed. It rides smoothly and with little fuss, and disguises its weight well when going through the corners too, but there’s no hiding how big it is Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer If you’re all about having a practical saloon, the 7 Series does okay with a 525-litre load area. The all-electric i7 gets slightly less with 500 litres. However, the Mercedes equivalents – the S-Class and EQS – get 550 litres and 610 litres respectively. And with the 7 Series and i7, you can’t fold the seats down to load longer items. Out on the road, the 7 Series feels super composed. Weighing north of two tonnes, it’s not light, but with the standard adaptive air suspension it rides smoothly and with little fuss. It disguises its weight well when going through the corners too. Around town, it is pretty long at 5.3m, but with the help of rear-wheel steering, it feels surprisingly manoeuvrable. There’s no hiding the fact that it’s a large car though, so thank goodness for the multiple cameras, making parking pretty simple. But where the 7 Series is peerless is cruising on the motorway. In the UK, we only get the 750e and M760e versions – both of which are plug-in hybrids offering up to 49 miles of electric driving. The electric punch matched with excellent engines should make overtaking and getting up to speed no problem. The BMW 7 Series is one of the best cars you can currently buy, and with its luxury appeal, it can definitely match the Mercedes S-Class in the premium limo market.

bmw,general,"Is the BMW 8 Series a good car? The BMW 8 Series is a sumptuous grand tourer with a luxurious interior, four seats and a surprising turn of speed. Go for a range-topping M850i model, and this BMW has the pace to take on the likes of the likes of the V8 Aston Martin DB11, the Bentley Continental GT and the Lexus LC. The BMW 8 Series’ interior might not have the same pizzaz as these more expensive rivals, but you still get an extremely sumptuous cabin with lashings of posh Merino leather and huge slabs of brushed metal. The tall centre console comes with a few too many fiddly buttons, but above it you’ll find a vast touchscreen infotainment display that’s one of the best around. It’s far easier to use than the clunky last-generation Mercedes system you get in the Aston Martin DB11 and it comes with some of the coolest graphics you’ll see this side of a Lamborghini – most noticeably on the standard digital driver’s display. Thankfully, the BMW 8 Series is more practical than a Lamborghini – and most other large coupes for that matter. There’s ample space in the front for very tall drivers to stretch out and you even get a pair of back seats as standard. Sure, these will be a very tight squeeze for adults but kids will have plenty of space to get comfy. There’s space in the boot for a couple of medium suitcases and you can even fold the back seats down to carry long luggage, too. This isn’t a car you’ll want to take to the tip, however – more likely you’ll be blasting down the autobahn or storming up a mountain pass on your way to the ski chalet. Speaking of which, driving the BMW 8 Series for long distances is an absolute doddle. The standard adaptive suspension does an excellent job ironing out potholes and even the most raucous M850i V8 model emits merely a whisper in eighth gear at motorway speeds. Turn onto a twisty back road, put it in Sport mode and hit the throttle and this relaxing grand tourer transforms into a surprisingly lithe sports car faster than you can say ‘hold on in the back!’. The 4.4-litre twin-turbo V8 produces a whopping 523hp which – combined with a grippy four-wheel-drive system – rockets the 8 Series from 0-62mph at a rate that’d make some supercars blush. The standard eight-speed automatic gearbox is one of the best in the business, too – shifting quickly and smoothly, no matter which of the driving modes you choose. Stick it in Sport and it’ll even sense when you’re entering a corner and prime the gearbox to deliver lightning-fast downshifts as soon as you hit the brakes. Go one step further into Sport+ mode and the standard adaptive suspension becomes firmer to make the four-wheel-drive M850i as squat and purposeful as possible. You can even get the car with an active anti-roll system that uses electric motors to physically lean the car into a corner as soon as you turn the steering wheel. The BMW 8 Series’ automatic gearbox is so clever it can actually tell the difference between very hard braking and an emergency stop and change gear accordingly Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Thankfully, BMW’s considered more than just what makes a car great fun to drive on a country road. The BMW 8 Series comes with four-wheel steering to help make it as stable as possible on the motorway and more manoeuvrable than its large size would suggest around town. That said, threading this imposing grand tourer through tight gaps in traffic is still a slightly nerve-wracking experience. Rear visibility is pretty poor and the small side windows don’t give you a particularly good view out. You could level these criticisms at almost every slinky four-seat sports car on sale, however, and they quickly fade into the background when you consider the BMW 8 Series’ impressive breadth of abilities. It’s an excellent long-distance cruiser yet summons up some sports car skills when you fancy having fun on a deserted back road.

bmw,general,"Is the BMW 8 Series Gran Coupe a good car? The 2019 BMW 8 Series Gran Coupe is the four-door version of the two-door BMW 8 Series flagship sports car. As such, the Gran Coupe’s front end is practically identical to its smaller sibling’s, sporting the same lean headlights and wide ‘kidney’ grille: the classic BMW trademark. Things change as you travel further backwards: the Gran Coupe has a more upright windscreen and rear window, intended to increase front headroom and boot space respectively. Oh yes, and then there’s the minor detail of the Gran Coupe having double the number of doors than the standard 8 Series coupe. The BMW 8 Series Gran Coupe’s wheelbase (the distance between the front and rear wheels) is 3,023mm – 201mm over the standard BMW 8 Series’. This means that the car will have more generous legroom for its rear passengers. Meanwhile, the steeper angle of the windscreen and rear windows will make for more headroom wherever you’re sat. BMW calls the Gran Coupe a “4+1-seater”, citing – alongside the two proper front and rear seats – the space for a fifth passenger in the middle of the rear bench, which, it claims, “is suitable for use on short journeys”. So, ideally, the Gran Coupe is best for accommodating anywhere up to four adults. The BMW 8 Series Gran Coupe has three engines for you to choose from: two petrols and one diesel. The entry-level version of the car – the 840i – is rear-wheel drive and has a six-cylinder petrol engine capable of putting out 340hp. This can take the Gran Coupe from 0-62mph in 5.2 seconds while returning a claimed fuel economy of up to 38.2mpg. From initial appearances, it seems that the mid-range 840d is going to be the pick of the 8 Series Gran Coupe range. It’s four-wheel-drive, meaning that – while its maximum power output is just 320hp – it can reach 62mph from a standstill in 5.1 seconds, with an impressive fuel economy of up to 45.6mpg. The range-topping, four-wheel-drive M850i trades economy for pure power. It goes from 0-62mph in only 3.9 seconds and has 530hp to play with. Sadly, BMW claims that it returns just 28.5mpg. We’ll have a full review on the BMW 8 Series Gran Coupe as soon as we’ve driven it. Until then, check out our BMW deals page and used BMW page to find our best 8 Series Gran Coupe prices, and find out how you can sell your car online through carwow.",,Carwow
bmw,general,"Is the BMW M5 a good car? Few car nameplates are as illustrious as ‘M5’ - not just a cracking bit of motorway, but BMW’s flagship 5 Series model since 1984. The latest BMW M5 (known as the ‘G90’ generation) marks a big step forwards as it’s the first time the M5 has used a plug-in hybrid powertrain. It’s like putting solar panels on your eight-bedroomed mansion - you’re not actually making that much difference to the planet, but you are unlocking numerous benefits for yourself and showing off how eco you are to the rest of the world. At the same time, you may well upset the purists who think a heat pump and underfloor heating is sacrilegious compared to a good old oil-fired Aga and some cast-iron radiators. There’s nothing backward-thinking about the new M5, though it does still have a distinctly old-school heart - underneath the batteries and motors of the plug-in hybrid system sits a 4.4-litre V8 petrol engine. This produces a beefy 585hp on its own, but combined with the whole system it produces an official 727hp (more on this later) and 1,000Nm of torque. That’s enough to give the M5 tremendous performance, despite its vast weight - at over 2,400kg, it’s heavier than a Range Rover Sport. A totally reworked suspension system with a hugely configurable set of adaptive dampers, four-wheel drive and rear-wheel steering all help to manage this weight, though. If you’re considering a BMW M5, you’ve probably got your eyes on quite a few - all hugely powerful - alternatives. For the first time in a while, you can choose from a BMW M5 as either a saloon or a Touring (estate) model - widening its appeal, and giving it even more natural alternatives. The most obvious is the Audi RS6, though Mercedes hasn’t yet launched its halo E-Class model yet, so only the less powerful E 53 is available. It too is a plug-in hybrid, though. The BMW M5's hybrid engine offers incredible performance, but it is incredibly heavy Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Other alternatives are numerous. There are luxury limos like the Porsche Panamera, but fans of practical performance are more than ever opting for fast SUVs these days - like BMW’s own X5 M Competition or the Range Rover Sport SV. There are even credible fully electric alternatives worth considering now, too, such as the Porsche Taycan, Audi RS e-tron GT, Mercedes EQE 53 or even the Tesla Model S Plaid. Outside of the engine and performance upgrades, the new M5 is very similar to the regular 5 Series - it’s even available as a Touring model for those who want a bit of extra boot space. You can tell it apart thanks to its chunky makeover, though, with wide wheel arches, new air intakes and quad exhausts at the rear. Inside, you get M-specific seats and upholstery, plus some bespoke touches to the infotainment and driver screen, but the 5 Series’ practical interior remains largely unchanged. Like the regular 5 Series plug-in hybrid, too, the M5 can be run on purely electric power, giving you the potential of some seriously low running costs - provided you can keep your foot off the loud pedal. It’s even quite a cost-effective company car, too. In the meantime, you can check out the best BMW M5 deals on Carwow, or look for other great BMW deals here.

bmw,general,"Is the BMW M8 Gran Coupe a good car? The BMW M8 Gran Coupe is a larger, more practical version of the M8 Coupe that comes with the same 625hp engine, but gets a more practical four-door body with a roomier boot and four seats. So, if you want an M car, but have too many friends, BMW has your back. Audi and Porsche have also got your back, though, because the Audi RS7 and Porsche Panamera also provide the same blend of coupe styling with two rows of seats and monumental performance. To help you tell it apart from the standard BMW 8 Series Gran Coupe, it gets more aggressive bumpers, four large exhaust pipes, new alloy wheels and plenty of optional carbon fibre details. Inside, you get lashings of leather trim on the doors, dashboard and seats, and the same brilliant iDrive Professional infotainment system and digital driver’s display as in the 8 Series. The Gran Coupe is quite a bit longer than the 8 Series Coupe and the widest car that BMW currently makes, so space inside for four adults is good. Those in that front can stretch out, while only the very tall will complain about headroom in the rear. The Gran Coupe’s large rear central console makes carrying a middle passenger difficult, mind. The M8 Gran Coupe is an impressive feat of engineering, but you can't help feeling the M850i is the pick of the range Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Its boot is smaller and more awkwardly shape than alternative efforts too. It doesn’t have great access, there’s a large lip to lift bags over and it has ridged sides that don’t make efficient use of the space. We fitted six carry-on cases inside, but a Panamera or RS7 will fit more. Under the BMW M8 Gran Coupe’s bonnet, you’ll find a 625hp version of the twin-turbo V8 in the M850i. This unit comes with plenty of parts shared with the BMW M5 Competition, including a grippy four-wheel-drive system that’ll blast the M8 Gran Coupe from 0-62mph in around three seconds. Performance isn’t a problem and neither is going around corners, because the M8 feels far more nimble than it should be given its size in its most aggressive drive modes. Even so, if you really value a pure driving experience, there are better (smaller) M cars on offer. The Gran Coupe also feels firm all of the time, which does get a little tiring and goes against its large luxury feel. But the main issue we have with the M8 Gran Coupe is that for a staggering wad of cash less, the M850i version provides 95% of the thrills with 100% of the luxury, not to mention a healthy dose more comfort too. However, if it has to be the M8, head over to our BMW deals page and used BMW page to see how much you can save on one. Be sure to see how you can sell your car online through carwow to make space for your BMW M8 Gran Coupe, too.",,Carwow
bmw,general,"Is the BMW X1 a good car? The BMW X1 is the baby of the Bavarian brand’s SUV range, headed by the enormous X7 seven-seater. It may still be the entry level SUV model, but the current model is far removed from the awkward-looking compact SUV-inspired hatchback the X1 once was. Think of it as the youngest sibling in a large family. It’ll always be seen as the little one, but now it’s grown out of puberty, graduated university and it should be taken seriously. And the X1 really has grown, not just in character but in size being larger in every direction than the model that came before it. It’s a much better looking car now, with a bluff front end sporting a pair of squared-off grilles and aggressive headlights. It’s a boxy car all round, looking even larger than it is with sharp angles and crisp lines all over - especially in M Sport trim, whereas xLine cars ditch the aggressive body kit in favour of tough looking black cladding. The interior of the X1 is sleeker than the exterior, with a pared-down dashboard featuring a prominent pair of screens in a single wide display. They’re crisp and easy to read, but the infotainment menus can be a little overwhelming to use. BMW has opted to get rid of physical climate control buttons and use touch controls on the 10.7-inch screen instead, but it’s rather fiddly to use on the move. Otherwise the cabin layout is easy to navigate and pleasant on the eye, with minimalistic shapes and contrasting trims across the width of the dashboard to break up the design. Gone is the traditional gear level, with a tiny gear selector switch in its place instead. Space is good in both the front and back of the X1, especially with the sliding reach bench set all the way back. Tall adults won’t struggle for headroom and legroom at any position, though boot space is maximised with the bench all the way forwards. The X1 beats its German alternatives for boot space, at 540 litres versus the Audi Q3’s 530 litres and the Mercedes GLA’s 495 litres - though the Volvo XC40 has the X1 licked with its 578-litre boot. The BMW X1 is a great looking car in every trim level, and it's practical too. You get a range of engines to choose from, but it’s an expensive choice of small SUV - especially in M35i spec Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer BMW has given its small SUV a wide range of engine options, with the cheapest being the entry-level petrol model. There are fuel efficient plug-in hybrid options and a range-topping M35i high-performance model. All X1 models are good fun on a twisty road, but being a BMW it’s hardly a surprise. There’s little in the way of body lean when attacking corners and the steering isn’t too light for decent grip feel. It’s definitely sportier than alternatives such as the VW T-Roc and Skoda Kamiq. The M35i model is a cut above, but that’s to be expected with its BMW M135i roots. Motorways are a little noisier than you might expect from a posh SUV with some noticeable wind and road noise - especially on the larger optional wheels. In town the X1 can get shaken up over broken roads, but good all-round visibility, automatic gearboxes and a small turning circle make city driving a breeze. The X1 should be at the top of your list for a premium small family SUV, and you can check out Carwow’s BMW X1 deals here. If you know you want a BMW but you're not sure on the X1, have a look at other new BMW deals instead. You could also browse used X1s or other used BMW deals too.

bmw,general,"Is the BMW iX1 a good car? The BMW iX1 is the German brand’s all-electric version of the ever-popular X1 SUV. The iX1 takes inspiration from the bulkier BMW iX flagship, while being the most compact family option of BMW's electric SUVs. It’s like getting the latest phone that’s one step down from the most advanced version but still on trend. Coming with the same exterior design as the latest X1, there are some blue tweaks alongside the kidney grille and angular headlights to mark out the electric version, but it's all very subtle. Sportier models also come with a more aggressive design. You get angular rear lights too with a 3D effect, plus a large rear window and sporty elements, such as the roof spoiler and low-end diffuser. Inside, there are few buttons cluttering the cabin – although that does mean you get fiddly infotainment and climate controls thanks to too many switches being removed. There’s also no iDrive control dial, which means you have to do all major functions through the touchscreen. The design is pleasing on the whole though, with soft materials used up high and on all the main touch points. In the back there’s a decent amount of space, with good head and knee room. Although quality on the whole is fine, it takes a step down from the front part of the cabin. That being said, it still feels like a top product. BMW iX1: Electric range, battery and charging data Range: 267-322 milesEfficiency: 3.5-4.0 miles per kWhBattery size: 67kWhMax charge speed: 130kWCharge time AC: 10hrs, 0-100% at 7kWCharge time DC: 29 mins, 10-80% at 130kWCharge port location: Right rearPower outputs: 201hp / 308hp Practicality-wise, the iX1 also holds its own, with an impressive 490-litre boot – only 10 litres less than the flagship iX. That being said, the boot is marginally smaller than that of the Audi Q4 e-tron, though larger than that of the Volvo XC40 Recharge. The iX1 comes with a pair of model options, both powered by the same 65kWh motor. The more powerful is the 313hp all-wheel drive xDrive30 complete with two electric motors, with one mounted on each axle for all-wheel drive. You get an official range of up to 270 miles, with the top M Sport having a slightly reduced max range of 267 miles. Then there's the front-wheel drive 204hp eDrive20 with a range of up to 294 miles. When you’re driving, it’s odd how much the iX1 feels like driving the much larger iX. The overall experience is refined and quiet, with little disruption from the outside world in terms of noise. It’s comfortable while cruising, but weighing over two tonnes contributes to the fact that you will feel some bumps through the cabin. With iX-style driving dynamics, the iX1 is well-balanced and has a premium feel. xLine has more than enough equipment for everything you need Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Around town is where the iX1 impresses most, as it is super quiet and with great visibility all round, you shouldn’t get caught out. The steering is light for easy manoeuvring, while it also doesn’t feel too big. The 'B' drive mode increases brake regen but doesn’t provide full one-pedal drive. Twistier roads do show up the weight again, as there's some lean through the bends if you’re going at higher speeds. But the steering, although lacking feel, is direct and you have plenty of grip. The iX1 feels remarkably composed and capable, and should be the benchmark if you’re in the market for an electric family SUV. It’s a shame that it’s rather expensive though.

bmw,general,"Is the BMW X2 a good car? The BMW X2 marks a dramatic departure from the previous model. The old X2 looks relatively plain and almost hatchback-like, but this new X2 gets sharper styling with a fastback rear and chunky sides, plus a big grille which optionally lights up at night. It won’t be to everyone’s taste, but it’s certainly more striking. Underneath, it’s using the same mechanical bits and pieces as the taller, more practical X1, so swapping to an X2 is a bit like kicking off your wedges and strapping on some stilettos — you can walk in both, but one is much more stylish than the other. There are several other sharply-styled SUVs you could consider, too. There’s the Audi Q3 Sportback, the Volvo EC40, the Lexus LBX, and the incoming Renault Rafale. The X2’s cabin is, of course, largely shared with the X1 and that means you get the impressive-looking curved screens atop the dashboard, which includes a big central infotainment screen and a digital instrument panel. A head-up display is also optional. For the most part, the cabin looks and feels quality, but there are some unpleasantly cheaper materials if you go looking. You do have to get used to operating almost everything through the touchscreen - including the climate controls and even some of the headlight controls, which is really annoying. But that’s a criticism that can be laid at the door of many of the X2’s alternatives. The X2 isn’t a case of style over substance - it’s good to drive and high-quality inside, but the starting price makes alternatives look cheap Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Surprisingly, the X2 doesn’t compromise its practicality too much compared to the X1. Yes, the sloping roof does mean that you can’t pack in big boxes like you can in the X1, but the actual boot volume below the luggage cover is slightly better. Space in the back seats is also fine, although you will notice that there’s less headroom and less light coming in than in the X1. You can choose from two petrol-engined options for the X2. There’s an entry level X2 20i, which uses a 2.0-litre turbo four-cylinder engine driving the front wheels through a seven-speed automatic gearbox. There’s also the X2 M35i, which also gets a four-cylinder turbo 2.0-litre engine, but which is amped-up to 300hp and has four-wheel drive and lower, firmer suspension. There’s also the all-electric BMW iX2, with a choice of two power outputs - we’ve reviewed this separately here.

bmw,general,"Is the BMW iX2 a good car? BMW has really made a mark in the electric car market, and the iX2 is the latest addition to its EV stable. As with the petrol-powered X2, it’s based on the same mechanical package as the iX1 electric SUV, but gets sharper exterior styling that comes a little at the expense of practicality. It’s a bit like sports fleece jackets — the iX1 is a roomy and comfy fleece, designed for practicality, while the iX2 is more sporty and form-fitting, with a tailored look to it. The iX2 is entering a pretty crowded marketplace when it comes to stylish electric SUVs and crossovers — there’s already the choice of the Audi Q4 e-tron Sportback, the Volvo EC40, and of course the big-selling Tesla Model Y. On the outside, the iX2 looks very much the same as the petrol X2 — if you’re trying to tell them apart, really aside from the badges the only way to do so is to look at the grille, which is blanked-off for the iX2. If you fancy an electric car but maybe don’t fancy making too big a visual statement about it, that could be a good thing for you. BMW iX2: electric range, battery and charging data Range: 266-282 milesEfficiency: 3.6-3.8 miles per kWhBattery size: 64.8kWhMax charge speed: 130kWCharge time AC: 10hrs 0mins, 0-100%, 7kWCharge time DC: 29mins, 10-80%, 130kWCharge port location: Right rearPower outputs: 204hp / 313hp That sharply-sloping rear roofline certainly marks the iX2 out as being one of the more stylish and dramatic-looking electric SUVs you can buy — it’s definitely more interesting to look at than the slightly blobby Audi or Tesla — but it won’t be to everyone’s taste. Inside, the cabin looks and feels very modern and high-tech, but some of the materials used are too cheap when you’re shopping at the more expensive end of the iX2’s price list. The big, wide, curved-screen layout for the infotainment screen and the driver’s instruments looks great though, and it’s hugely responsive. The layout is fairly easy to find your way around, too, and the on-screen icons are large and easy to press, but there are a few too many complicated sub-menus for some functions. Practicality takes a hit compared to the iX1, as despite the boot being large on paper compared to most alternatives the sloping roof limits the size of loads that you can take. And while the rear seats are really roomy for two adults, the centre seat is almost useless - making the iX2 a four-seater except for very occasional use. With 313hp and all-wheel drive, the BMW iX2 has the performance to back up the car's sporty looks Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer BMW sells two versions of the iX2. Although they use the same size of battery, the more powerful all-wheel drive version doesn’t go as far on a charge as the less powerful two-wheel drive version, which can go 282 miles. The iX2 is as quiet and refined as you’d hope from an electric car, but while it does drive well, and can corner hard, there’s maybe not the gap between it and rivals from Volvo and Audi that there used to be. The steering is satisfying, although a little odd at times, and performance is ample. Like the iX1 it’s up there as one of the benchmarks in the sector. If you’re interested, check out the latest BMW iX2 deals on Carwow. You can also check out used BMW iX2s for sale, or other used BMWs here.

bmw,general,"Is the BMW X3 a good car? The BMW X3 is an incredibly popular family SUV - more than 3.5 million have been sold since it launched in 2003. The latest model aims to stand out with its striking exterior design, ultra-modern interior and new plug-in hybrid engine. Both upmarket and eco-conscious, then, it’s like eating at a Nobu restaurant and ordering the vegan option. It’s one of BMW’s core SUV models, being larger than the X1 but smaller than the X5 - a true family SUV, making it an alternative to cars such as the Audi Q5, Mercedes GLC, Volvo XC60 and Alfa Romeo Stelvio. At the same time, many growing families may be looking to increasingly posh offerings from less upmarket brands as a way to get more bang for their buck - think the Hyundai Santa Fe or Volkswagen Tiguan. The old X3 did look a bit like it had been designed by a committee, starting with a generic SUV shape and just pasting on BMW’s signature features such as the kidney grilles and quad headlights. The new model is much more distinctive, with a very clean look helped in no small part by ditching the black plastic cladding that used to adorn the wheel arches. There’s also an eye-catching new grille which has a mixture of diagonal and vertical lines - though racier models get a more conventional look - and which can even be illuminated by a thin LED strip around the outside. The sides are smooth, with faint sculpting giving the suggestion of a wheel arch, and recessed door handles mean there’s nothing to protrude. It’s a similar story at the rear, which has a smooth tailgate and big, angular LED taillights. Inside it’s an even bigger change. There’s a large twin-screen infotainment setup and an interesting knitted texture on the dashboard, though it’s great to see BMW’s retained some of the features we love such as the rotary controller for the infotainment system that makes it much easier to use on the move than a pure touchscreen. The new X3 looks good and drives well - shame it’s not as nice inside as its predecessor Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The most obvious feature, though, is that where BMWs of old may have used tons of chrome trim, in the new X3 it’s largely been replaced with huge hunks of translucent plastic through which sophisticated ambient lighting shines. It’s quite effective, particularly at night, but it’s definitely an acquired taste and does highlight that the interior doesn’t feel quite as luxuriously built as the old car, with some quite cheap and nasty materials around. It’s also not hugely spacious for family life. The front seats are roomy but the rears are only average, and there’s a big hump in the floor which makes the centre seat quite uncomfortable. The boot is a good size at 570 litres, marginally larger than an Audi Q5 or Alfa Romeo Stelvio, but it’s beaten easily by a Mercedes GLC or a VW Tiguan. Storage for smaller items is also a bit limited. There are four engines to choose from in the UK. There’s a 2.0-litre petrol or 2.0-litre diesel, both of which provide plenty of performance for everyday life. The most interesting is the 30e plug-in hybrid, which has up to 56 miles of all-electric range - meaning low company car tax bills and big potential fuel savings. All of these models are fairly pleasant to drive with comfortable suspension and refined engines, though they’re not quite as enjoyable as the old X3 was. At the top of the range there’s a rapid M50 model, which has a 3.0-litre six-cylinder engine and plenty of performance upgrades making it a totally different car to drive. This version of the X3 takes aim at the Audi SQ5 and Mercedes-AMG GLC 43 and does so pretty well, thanks to tidy driving dynamics and plenty of performance.

bmw,general,"Is the BMW iX3 a good car? The BMW iX3 is the company’s electric SUVs and an alternative to the Audi e-tron, Mercedes EQC, Ford Mustang Mach-E and Skoda Enyaq. It’s the BMW equivalent of the Monsters Inc story. Until now, the company has used scary old petrol and diesel to generate power, but now they’ve found out that laugh-a-minute electricity actually works a whole lot better for everybody, and makes you smile, too. So the iX3 is new, but just doesn’t look it. Up front, there’s the usual BMW grille, but it’s all a clever ruse because it doesn’t have to cool an engine, so it has been sealed to help reduce drag and give the car’s range a small boost. A dimpled pattern breaks up what would otherwise be a big sheet of black plastic. The 20-inch wheels are unique to the BMW iX3, too. Their heavily sculpted design helps to smooth airflow along the side of the car, improving range, although they look exceptionally vulnerable to kerbing. Assorted blue highlights to designate the electric model dotted around the iX3 – most obviously on the rear bumper where you’d normally spot some exhaust pipes – finish off the styling changes. There are also blue highlights around the ‘grille’, the badges and the sills. EV Range Test: Audi Q4 e-tron v BMW iX3 v Hyundai Ioniq 5 v Kia EV6 v Skoda Enyaq Under the skin is a solitary 286hp electric motor that also generates 400Nm of torque and drives the rear wheels. There’s an 80kWh battery pack that should give a range of up to 285 miles – that’s according to the latest official testing procedure. That’s a bit more than key alternatives such as the Audi e-tron and Mercedes-Benz EQC, but a bit less than the Jaguar I-Pace. In the real world it will be a bit below that, especially in cold, wet conditions. The iX3 should be compatible with almost every kind of charging station or power outlet, including super-fast 150kW chargers, which can give an 80% recharge in just 34 minutes. This means you can add 60-ish miles of range in about 10 minutes. There aren’t many 150kW chargers in the UK, but the network is growing. BMW iX3: electric range, battery and charging data Range: 286 - 290 milesEfficiency: 3.4-3.5 miles per kWhBattery size: 74kWhMax charge speed: 150kW / 250kWCharge time AC: 7hrs 30mins, 0-100%, 11kWCharge time DC: 34mins, 0-80%, 150kWCharge port location: Right rearPower outputs: 282hp Charging from less powerful outlets (such as a home wall-box charger or three-pin plug) will take longer – BMW reckons a full charge from empty will take around 12 hours. While electricity prices have risen lately, they’re not rising as fast as the cost of petrol or diesel, so an electric iX3 will still be much cheaper to run than a conventional X3. All electric cars feature brake regeneration – a system that uses the electric motor as an extra brake that can feed energy back to the batteries that would otherwise be lost as the car slows down. This always happens when you press the brake pedal, but the iX3 joins many of the latest electric cars by giving the system the ability to bring you to a stop when you lift off the accelerator pedal, too. It allows for one-pedal driving, which (once you’re used to it) is an extremely relaxing way of dealing with urban traffic. It’s not the fastest version of the X3, but it’s still pretty quick with a 0-60mph time of 6.8 seconds. Top speed is limited to 112mph, which helps to preserve range. It’s more than enough for UK drivers, anyway. The first thing you notice when you get out and about in your iX3 is how quiet it is. There’s no noise from the engine and transmission, so you only notice a little wind and road noise as your speed rises. A 285-mile range puts BMW right in the ballpark. It's better than a Mercedes EQC but not as good as a Jaguar I-Pace Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Adaptive suspension is fitted to the iX3 as standard, so it’s pretty comfortable, although a Mercedes EQC still trumps it for out-and-out ride quality. However, the suspension stops the iX3’s body from rolling too much during cornering. The iX3 grips strongly, too, and its handling is doubtless helped by the fact that the batteries are stored in the floor, lowering the centre of gravity. Flicking the suspension into Sport model firm things up a lot, to the extent that it makes the ride too firm, but it certainly sharpens the handling and gives the iX3 a distinctly sporty feel. All iX3s are well equipped. The entry-level M Sport comes with a 12.3-inch digital driver’s display and 12.3-inch touchscreen infotainment system, wireless phone charging, electrically adjustable leather seats, adaptive suspension (which lets you choose between soft, comfortable settings and stiffer, sportier ones) and a panoramic glass roof. The top-spec M-Sport Pro car has a Harman Kardon audio system, a head-up display and an automatic parking system.

bmw,general,"Is the BMW X4 a good car? The BMW X4 is based on the old X3, and it’s a sleeker, sportier-looking SUV that tries to convince you that it’s a coupe. It sits between the X2 and the X6 in terms of size, and while it’s not as practical as the X3, it’s arguably the more stylish car. It’s like a chic tote bag instead of a big, roomy suitcase. Not as useful, but rather more fashionable. Inside, the X4 doesn’t have the high-tech, big-screen setup of the new X3, and nor does it have the latest tech boasted by the Mercedes GLC Coupe, but the quality levels are very high and it’s a well-designed cabin. While the X4 doesn’t get the new X3’s big, sweeping digital screen dashboard, it does stick with the old separate instrument panel and touchscreen, both 12.3 inches across. The big screen in the middle uses older iDrive software that’s still good to use, and it’s easier to control on the move than a touchscreen-only system thanks to the click-wheel controller down on the console. Up front, there’s plenty of space even if you’re tall, and the adjustable steering wheel and excellent sports seats mean that the driving position is both very good and very comfortable. In the back seats, legroom is fine but that sloping roofline means that tall rear seat passengers will find that their heads are brushing the ceiling, and it’s a bit dark and gloomy back there. The boot is actually pretty good — it holds just 45 litres less than the roomy new X3, at least when you measure up to the luggage cover — and the floor is flat, with no loading lip so it’s easy to heft heavy items up and into the boot. The rear seats fold flat, and they split 40:20:40 for maximum practicality, but you do lose a good bit of seats-down space compared to the X3 — a full 200 litres. If you’ve decided you like the looks and don’t mind the BMW X4’s reduced practicality, there’s plenty to like about the way it drives and presents itself inside Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The standard X4’s engine choice is limited to just two diesels now. If you go for a sporty M model, there’s a bit more choice, with a more powerful straight-six petrol and straight-six diesel, and even a full-on 510hp X4 M if you really want to go nuts. All models come with BMW’s xDrive four-wheel drive as standard, and all come with an eight-speed automatic gearbox. The X4 is actually quite frugal, at least in 2.0-litre xDrive20d diesel form. Thanks to that four-wheel drive system being able to disconnect the front wheels to save fuel, 49mpg is theoretically possible, with low-40s being a realistic goal. It’s still quick, hitting 62mph in 7.9 seconds, which is fine unless you truly crave the 3.8 seconds of the X4 M… For a big 4x4, the X4 is decent to drive, and keeps its composure when traversing a bumpy, twisty British B-road. The xDrive four-wheel drive sends a bit more power to the rear wheels than the fronts, allowing for a more enjoyable driving setup, but the steering isn’t as talkative as it ought to be, and so a Porsche Macan (the petrol one, not the electric one) makes a more engaging car on a challenging road. The X4 can be had with optional adaptive suspension, and this is a must. Not only does it sharpen up the handling for twisty roads, in Comfort mode it also makes the X4 noticeably more comfortable over bumps. Without the adaptive springs, it’s just not as comfy as a Mercedes GLC Coupe. The new BMW X3 is far more technologically advanced than this X4, and comes with the option of a plug-in hybrid engine, but if style is what matters, then the X4 is still worth considering.

bmw,general,"Is the BMW X5 a good car? There aren’t many cars that can do what the BMW X5 can do: it’s like a roomy, comfortable hot hatch on stilts. It’s genuinely enjoyable to drive, much more so than alternatives such as the Audi Q7 and Mercedes GLE. If you want to get something closer, you’ll need to head to a Porsche Cayenne, but that’s a bit like a 100-metre sprinter at a marathon – it isn’t quite as comfortable or practical for families over long distances - which helped the BMW X5 to win the Adventurer's Choice category of the 2025 Carwow Car of the Year Awards. The BMW X5 has most cars very much licked on the luxury front, though. Everywhere you prod there are luxurious materials and soft-touch plastic, from the top of the dashboard to the door tops. Sure, the overall design is slightly more conservative than that of a Mercedes GLE, but for some, that’ll be a good thing, and an update in 2023 brought a much more modern design to close the gap. You get BMW's excellent twin-screen setup on the dashboard. The curved displays look suitably modern, with the one on the right displaying all the relevant driving information and the one on the left for your infotainment. It's a touchscreen and really quick to respond to your inputs, but the menus are quite complicated to find your way around. Group test: Audi Q7 v BMW X5 v Mercedes GLE v Porsche Cayenne v VW Touareg Another important factor in a large luxury SUV is space and the BMW X5 offers plenty of it. Those in the front will have no complaints and the driver gets a supportive seat with full electric adjustment and a memory function. There’s plenty of space in the back seats, as well – two tall adults will sit comfortably behind those in the front, while a third won’t be sounding off on a long journey either. That spaciousness continues to the boot, with the X5 having 650 litres, which is a good chunk less than you get in an Audi Q7 and Porsche Cayenne, though the BMW is a bit more spacious than the Mercedes GLE. There are four engines to choose from. The plug-in hybrid will be the best option for those who can charge regularly, and it also has the lowest tax rate for company car buyers. There's a sporty petrol if running costs aren't a concern, but most people will find one of the diesels offers the best all-round experience. In town, the BMW X5, despite its size, isn’t daunting to manoeuvre thanks to good visibility for the driver through its tall wide windows and standard front and rear parking sensors. In fact, BMW includes its Parking Assistant, which will steer the car into a space for you and you can add rear-wheel steering as an option for better low-speed manoeuvrability. Porsche, Land Rover, Mercedes and Audi all make very good large SUVs, but the X5 is the best all-rounder for us Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer It’s a comfortable experience, too; the X5’s optional adaptive air suspension does a good job of soaking up ruts, potholes and broken Tarmac in its most comfortable setting. That said, the M Competition’s firmer suspension (in the name of going around corners more quickly) isn’t as comfy when the going gets rough. On twisty country roads, the BMW X5 steers with precision and on its standard suspension handles well – particularly in its firmer ‘sport’ setting. The M Competition’s still-firmer suspension props the X5 up even more effectively through bends and the range-topper is more agile to drive. But, calm things down to a cruise on the motorway, and all the engines are quiet, while wind and road noise are kept to a minimum. You do hear more road noise in the M50i and M Competition with their huge alloys and super-wide tyres, though.

bmw,general,"Is the BMW X6 a good car? The BMW X6 is a bit like Snapchat. When it first appeared, people wondered what the point was. Does anybody need a car that’s part SUV, part coupe? But like Snapchat, the X6 has defied the naysayers to prove quite popular. This large coupe-style SUV has strong engines and seating for five. It’s a sleeker version of the BMW X5 and an alternative to the similarly-styled Mercedes GLE Coupe and Porsche Cayenne Coupe. The X6 has been updated for 2024 but you still get the classic, chunky proportions that you expect from an off-roader, with a rakishly angled roof that echoes the sleek lines of a sports car. As is the trend in recent BMWs, the trademark ‘kidney’ grille is now enormous. It’s also available with illumination, to make it even more, er, eye-catching. Inside the look and feel is very BMW X5, which is a good thing. It has an interesting design but functional button layout and everything feels extremely well put together. It also means you get BMW’s latest twin-screen infotainment system, which looks amazing although some functions are harder to use than before the latest update. There are good and bad points to the X6’s space and practicality. Okay, so you’ll seat four adults just fine inside, but the X6 loses some rear headroom in the name of style compared with the X5, plus its middle seat is quite uncomfortable. The boot is smaller than an X5’s (and the Mercedes’ or Porsche’s) and a more awkward shape thanks to its sloping roofline. You’re paying a premium over the X5 for this, remember. The BMW X6 was the coupe SUV that started the discussion – you either love or hate the way it looks. This one has a light-up grille, which I’ll leave you to make your mind up on… Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer There’s a choice of petrol and diesel engines, but the highlight of the range is the performance-focused M60i. This twin-turbo V8 petrol has 530hp and a 0-62mph time of 4.3 seconds. The X6M Competition gives you more power (625hp) for a 0-62mph time of 3.9 seconds. That’s staggering pace for a car of this size and weight, but it is even more expensive to run than the M60i and requires more compromise to comfort. Even the entry-level engines are extremely strong, and given the diesel is the cheapest and most fuel-efficient of the range it makes the most sense. Whichever engine you choose, the X6 feels bulky but comfortable in town and more agile than it has any right to be on a country road given its size. On the motorway, it’s supremely comfy and quiet with the latest driver assistance tech available. The BMW X6 is a mixed bag, then. It’s superb to drive, has a lovely cabin and an eye-candy infotainment system. You’re better off just spending less money on the more practical X5, though, unless you really prefer the X6’s styling and don’t need the space. If that’s the case, you should check out the latest BMW X6 deals on Carwow to see how much money you can save. You can also browse the latest used BMW X6 stock, as well as other used BMWs. When the time comes, you can sell your current car through Carwow, too.",,Carwow
bmw,general,"Is the BMW X7 a good car? Let’s address the elephant in the room – oh, and this elephant also has a set of comedy gnashers on. Yes, the way the BMW X7 looks will not be to everybody’s taste, but if you like your large luxurious SUVs to be imposing, it doesn’t get much more so than the X7’s whopping great grille filling somebody’s rearview mirror. In fact, the BMW X7 is arguably more imposing than the upmarket SUVs it competes with, the Land Rover Discovery, Audi Q7 and Mercedes GLS. Even a full-fat Range Rover. Think of it as American sports announcer Michael Buffer at a headteacher’s conference. Watch: BMW X7 v Range Rover Inside, things are more restrained, but suitably high quality. You’ll find plenty of piano black, leather and metal surfaces, while adding a (pricey) full merino leather option brings leather lower down and a two-tone shade. Ultimately, you’ll struggle to find any scratchy plastics here and the X7 gives all its alternatives a run for their money inside. The dash is dominated by the curved twin-screen display that incorporates BMW’s latest iDrive infotainment system. It’s stunning to look at, but not quite as easy to use as the previous generation. There are a few functions that are now buried in menus rather than easily accessible with a single button press. It still has a rotary controller with menu shortcut buttons between the front seats, and you can choose to use that, the touchscreen or use voice commands. The second screen behind the steering wheel takes the place of conventional instruments. It’s clear, crisp and configurable, so you can have the information displayed that you want, including things like speed, fuel consumption, navigation info and your radio or media selection. Bluetooth, DAB radio and Apple CarPlay smartphone mirroring is all included, although not Android Auto. All-in-all, it’s better than anything from Audi or Land Rover, although the digital dash and infotainment in the Mercedes GLS is even better. The BMW X7 is a proper seven-seater as standard, which is to say, two adults will be able to sit in comfort in its rearmost seats on a long journey. A BMW X5’s optional third row is much tighter, for example. For not much extra you can swap the X7’s middle row from a three-seat bench to two more luxurious pews. If you can live with six seats rather than seven, it's worth considering Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The X7’s front two rows are even more spacious and the driver is treated to a wide range of electric seat and wheel adjustment. In fact, the middle row can be adjusted and folded electrically, while the third row folds into the boot floor electrically too. Handy buttons in the boot allow you to fold the rear two rows all at the same time for ease. Even with all seven seats up, the X7 still offers 320 litres of boot space, which is about the same as a VW Polo. Fold the rearmost seats down and that grows to a huge 750 litres – that’ll handle pretty much anything a family can throw at it. And you get a fancy split tailgate. You have a choice between one diesel and two petrol engines when buying a BMW X7. The pick of the bunch is the X7 xDrive40d diesel because, with 352hp and an official fuel economy of 32.8-36.2mpg, it has all the power you’ll need, but will keep the bills sensible. The 530hp M60i petrol is much quicker, but also much more expensive in every way, while the 381hp 40i petrol is strong and smooth, but thirstier than the diesel. The BMW X7 is vast, so driving and parking it in town can be a little daunting. Still, it comes with front and rear sensors, multiple cameras for a 3D view of the car and a system that’ll park and even reverse for you. So, no excuses then. Out of town and on meandering country roads the X7 is one of the tidiest SUVs of its type to drive despite its size, but you’ll probably be more interested in just how comfortable its air suspension is over bumps and how quiet it is at a cruise on the motorway. There’s very little wind and road noise at all, and adding BMW’s Driving Assistant Professional optional package brings a system that will accelerate, brake and keep you in your lane for an even more relaxing drive. So, make peace with its looks, don’t get carried away with BMW’s options list and the X7 is a fine luxury seven-seat SUV. Remember, though, that it’s more expensive to buy than a Discovery or Q7, and that if you don’t need seven roomy seats, BMW’s cheaper X5 makes much more sense.

bmw,general,"Is the BMW iX a good car? This big, striking SUV is the BMW iX, the German brand’s biggest electric model and an alternative to other luxury SUVs, such as the Polestar 4 and Mercedes EQE SUV. You might also consider it as a posher alternative to the Kia EV9 if you don’t need all that space. An electric family SUV isn’t a particularly wild concept these days, but it seems no one told BMW’s designers. Like so many of the brand’s other cars, the iX has a really striking exterior design. It’s a bit like Marmite – you might love it, you might hate it, but it’s hard not to have an opinion either way. From those sharp lines and creases on its bonnet and wheelarches; to its big alloys, massive, toothy grille and squinty headlights – it’s certainly a very busy-looking design. In white in particular, you could say that it looks like someone crashed the Space Shuttle Discovery into the back of some sort of giant robotic beaver. Someone should probably tell NASA… Its dimensions are more conventional, being roughly comparable to the current X5 SUV on the outside, but with an interior that’s closer to the bigger X7 in terms of the space. And while you won’t get the option of seven seats on this new electric SUV, its cabin doesn’t skimp on any sense of luxury, tech or eco appeal. BMW iX: electric range, battery and charging data Range: 259-377 milesEfficiency: 2.8-3.1 miles per kWhBattery size: 74kWh / 108kWhMax charge speed: 250kWCharge time AC: 11hrs, 0-100%, 7kW / 16hrs 15mins, 0-100%, 7kWCharge time DC: 31mins, 10-80%, 250kW / 35 mins, 10-80%, 250kWCharge port location: Right rearPower outputs: 322hp / 516hp / 610hp That tech appeal is emphasised by a pair of huge screens that dominate the cabin. The 12.3-inch instrument panel and 14.9-inch infotainment display combine almost seamlessly to look like one big, curved display – it's an impressive sight from behind the wheel. You get a wireless charge pad, multiple USB-C ports and a range of connected services too. Build quality is top notch, and it’s very practical too with lots of space for five adults to stretch out. Boot space could be a bit more generous, though. With a 500-litre capacity, there’s less room for bags than you’ll find in the Polestar 4. You can choose from three power outputs, depending on whether you are happy with a quick car or you feel the need to warp the fabric of space and time. All three have an electric motor at each axle for all-wheel drive and a battery pack housed low down beneath the floor. The entry-level 326hp xDrive40 model has an official range of up to 264 miles, while the 523hp xDrive50 has a bigger battery that will see it travel up to 383 miles on a charge. If that’s not quick enough for you, the iX M60 has 619hp, a range of up to 349 miles, and a 0-60mph time of under four seconds. The cars have slightly different maximum charge rates (150kW for the xDrive40 and 200kW for the xDrive50 and M60), but the long and short of it is that any iX will be able to use a DC rapid charger to go from 10-80% capacity in less than 40 minutes. Plug in at home with a 7kW charger, and a full recharge will take up to 16 hours. The BMW iX is one of the best electric SUVs to drive, and has one of the coolest interiors, too Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Whichever model you go for, the BMW iX is one of the best electric SUVs to drive. It might be big, but excellent visibility makes it pretty easy to navigate tight city streets, while the air suspension on xDrive50 models smooths out bumps in the road for a comfortable drive. Out on the motorway it's lovely and quiet, making long journeys relaxing, while each of the motor options will get you up to speed quickly. And when you take the iX down a twisty road it swaps serene comfort for surprising agility. This is still a big, heavy SUV, but it's one of the more capable electric SUVs in corners. All models have all-wheel drive, which helps offer reassuring grip as you accelerate out of bends. If this sounds like the car for you, head on over to our BMW iX deals page to see how much money Carwow can save you. You can also get a great deal on a used iX as well as other used BMWs.

bmw,general,"Is the BMW i4 a good car? The BMW i4 is like a 4 Series from a decade in the future. It shares a very similar outline, but uses all-electric power and has a slightly bolder design, as well as having a more advanced interior. It certainly won’t fade into the background, as BMW has fitted the huge kidney grille from the 4 Series Gran Coupe that the i4 is based on. In the cabin, the i4 has a plush finish to match other BMW models – it definitely feels more upmarket in here than a Tesla Model 3, and can match a Polestar 2. Entry-level models come with cloth seat trim as standard, but leather is also on offer for those wanting a high-end feel. Regardless, it’s a well-built and neatly designed cabin, but the infotainment is the star of the show and features the impressive curved display combining the 12.3-inch instrument and 14.9-inch infotainment screens in one sleek unit. Compared to the 4 Series Gran Coupe, it’s 6mm taller and sits 15mm closer to the road – but remains mostly the same. Taller passengers may struggle to fit in the rear due to the sloping roof line, but knee room is acceptable. As it’s based on a conventional fuel-powered car, there isn’t a flat floor in the footwell, so fitting three adults in will be a struggle. However, the door openings are a good size and it is more than comfortable enough. You’ll be happy to hear that it’s quite spacious in the boot, with the hatchback tailgate opening up to provide a roomy load space. The rear seats fold down to reveal a flat floor, too. The BMW i4 is the all-electric cousin of the 4 Series Gran Coupe. The M50 version is as fast as an M3 to 60mph, just not quite as fun to drive Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The i4 comes in three versions. The entry-level eDrive35 has 282hp and claims up to 299 miles of range, while the eDrive40 ups this to 366 miles courtesy of a larger battery. That version comes with a 340hp rear-mounted electric motor setup that also produces 430Nm. The top-spec i4 M50 version – which was developed by BMW's M division – is fitted with two electric motors. With one fitted on each axle, the M50 comes with four-wheel drive and has a stout 544hp and 795Nm on tap. With the same sized battery as the eDrive40, though, claimed range is reduced to up to 318 miles. Whichever i4 you want, performance isn’t an issue. Even the eDrive35 models can do the sprint to 62mph in 6.0 seconds. But if you want brutal electric acceleration, the M50 gets to 62mph in 3.9 seconds (we bettered that in our video, however). Top speed is 140mph, though, rather than the usual 155, because the range of an EV really suffers at high speed. In town, the i4 feels very comfortable over bumps and cracks in the surface thanks to air suspension at the rear, and it’s pretty nimble as well. M50 models come with adaptive suspension for further comfort, meaning that even the higher-performance model can deal nicely with poorer surfaces. As standard, the i4 features adaptive cruise control and a reversing camera – making driving on the motorway and parking much simpler respectively. Refinement is also excellent throughout the i4 line-up, with only tyre noise making an impression. If the i4 sounds like the model for you, check out our deals page to see what price you can get for this stylish electric four-door.

bmw,general,"Is the BMW i5 a good car? The BMW i5 is a bit like an alcohol-free pilsner. You still enjoy the refreshing taste of German lager, but it’s better for you – or in this case the planet. You see, the new i5 is the all-electric version of the latest BMW 5 Series. So you can choose a traditional pilsner if you can live with an internal-combustion hangover, or pick the EV if you want to wake up feeling refreshed and virtuous in the morning. If you plan to stick with a conventionally powered BMW for a while longer, have a read of our review of the 5 Series. Here we’re focusing on the all-electric i5, and spoiler alert, it's good. The two models look broadly similar from the outside. With a smaller grille than some recent BMWs, the styling isn’t as divisive as other current Beemers. It’s a bit more understated, but it's certainly not a looker – though we have a feeling that the looks will grow on us as we become more used to the design. A slow-burner, maybe. There are two power outputs to choose from. The less powerful is the i5 eDrive40, which has one 340hp motor powering the rear wheels. Step up to the M60 for two electric motors, one for the front wheels and one for the rears. Being four-wheel drive has to be a good thing when the car has 601hp. The regular eDrive40 is quick, with a 0-62mph time of six seconds. The M60 reaches 62mph in a kidney-bruising 3.8 seconds. Both models have the same battery pack, with an 81.2 kWh usable capacity. In the less powerful, lighter model, that gives an official range of up to 357 miles, dropping to a maximum of 315 miles for the heavier range-topper. That compares with 376 miles for a Mercedes EQE 350, one of the alternatives that could be on your shortlist if you are looking for an upmarket electric saloon. Will you be able to travel that far in the real world? Well, the way you drive will make a big difference. When Mat drove the M60 in Portugal the range was closer to 200 miles, but car reviewers aren’t renowned for driving gently. Assume that’s a worst-case scenario, and the official numbers are a best case. The i5 has a lovely interior and incredible performance, it's just a shame it doesn't go a bit further on a charge Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Plenty of electric cars are fast in a straight line, but BMWs are supposed to be fun around corners as well. The i5 corners with poise, especially cars with adaptive sports suspension and active anti-roll bars. The trouble is, the i5 is heavier than the regular 5 Series saloon, weighing as much as a big 4x4. The M60 is especially heavy, which is a shame as the car doesn’t feel as light on its feet as we’d hope. Get carried away and the front tyres push wide surprisingly early. Drive more steadily and the i5 is remarkably comfortable and super-quiet, with only a murmur of wind and road noise. Inside, the cabin is a high-tech banquet for the eyes, with a huge twin-screen display and an exceptional standard of finish. Even lower down the dash and doors there’s no sign of penny-pinching. Only the brittle action of the indicator stalks feels less than premium. There’s plenty of space front and rear, too, although the big transmission tunnel that exists for the internal-combustion-engined 5 Series gets in the way if there are three passengers in the back. The car is packed with clever tech, although frustratingly perhaps the smartest technology of all isn’t available in the UK. The optional upgrade for the adaptive cruise control available in some markets will change lanes for you. All the driver needs to do is look in their mirrors to check that it’s safe, and the car’s sensors can tell that you’ve looked to the side and will swap lanes. Where legal, the driver can even take their hands off the wheel. The eye activation feature is launching initially in Germany, the USA and Canada. A UK launch date for the automated lane-changing function has not been confirmed. So, clever, quick, and very good to drive – if not quite great compared with BMW’s greatest hits of the past. Next to other electric saloons, though, the i5 is pretty much as good as it gets, and if you need a bit more practicality, a BMW i5 Touring is coming later this year.

bmw,general,"Is the BMW i5 Touring a good car? The BMW i5 Touring is an electric estate car, which means it’s a very rare thing indeed. You get the same posh interior and silent running as the i5 saloon, but with a bit more practicality. It’s like a North Face duffle bag, because it’s big, practical and has designer appeal. It's also extremely good - so good, it picked up Highly Commended in the Comfortable Cruiser category of the 2025 Carwow Car of the Year Awards. As it stands, the only other electric estates in this price range are the Volkswagen ID7 Tourer and the Audi A6 Avant e-tron, so you might also cross-shop the i5 Touring with electric SUVs such as the BMW iX, Audi Q8 e-tron and Polestar 3. BMW’s modern styling is certainly an acquired taste, but with the i5 we’re either getting used to it or the styling department is finding its groove, because it’s a much more cohesive design than other recent models such as the iX. There are plenty of sharp angles and creases in the bodywork that give it a distinctive appearance, though base models get softer styling that looks a bit plain. There can be no complaints about the interior though, because it’s a lovely place to eat up miles. The seats are soft and there are quality materials throughout, and all trim levels get the same high quality twin-screen infotainment displays. They look great with clear graphics, though the menus can be really confusing to navigate around. BMW i5 Touring: electric range, battery and charging data Range: 279 - 343 milesEfficiency: 3.0 - 3.7 miles/kWhBattery size: 84kWhMax charge speed: 205kWCharge time AC: 12h 30mins, 0-100%, 7.4kWCharge time DC: 30mins, 10-80%, 205kWCharge port location: Right side rearPower outputs: 340hp / 601hp It’s spacious too, with plenty of adjustment to get yourself comfortable – you don’t get the same commanding view as an SUV, but the upside is that you feel more snug within the cockpit, rather than sat atop it. Storage is good in the front and there’s loads of room in the back seats, too. The main advantage of the estate body shape is that the BMW i5 Touring has a big boot – at 570 litres it should be enough space for the vast majority of people, and more space than any of the electric SUVs mentioned above, though the VW ID7 Tourer estate has more space still if you really need it. There are two motor options to choose between, with the eDrive40 being the more affordable car to buy and to run, with a top-of-the-range M60 also available with ludicrous performance at the expense of range. As such, the eDrive40 can go up to 348 miles between charges, compared with 314 miles for the M60, which puts it behind what alternatives such as the Audi A6 Avant e-tron (437 miles) and Polestar 3 (403 miles) are capable of. The BMW i5 Touring is an incredibly comfortable and refined car, and the practical boot is the icing on the cake Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Regardless, the way the BMW i5 Touring chews through those miles is incredibly impressive, because it’s one of the most comfortable, quiet and refined cars on sale today. You feel utterly cocooned from the outside world. That means it’s a great motorway cruiser, but also means pothole-riddled inner-city roads and bumpy B-roads do little to unsettle the car. It’s fairly composed going around corners, with little in the way of body roll, but you really do feel its weight, so it’s not a car that encourages you to drive it like a sports car. However, if you’re looking for a comfortable and refined car to cruise around in, the BMW i5 Touring has very few weak points, most of which are worthy sacrifices for something so comfortable and practical.

bmw,general,"Is the BMW i7 a good car? The BMW i7 is an electric saloon that has some controversial looks and joins the iX as the electric flagship of the BMW line-up. It’s the electric alternative to the 7 Series and features the latest battery technology from the German firm. It’s a lot like buying a nice faux leather jacket instead of one made from a cow. Looks-wise, the i7 will definitely split opinions. But once you’re used to it, the large kidney grilles and split headlights look pretty smart, while the long bonnet exudes class. The limousine styling continues down the side, so it can look a bit slab-sided, but the optional two-tone paint option could be a master stroke if you like that sort of thing. From the rear, it’s pretty square, and you don’t get a full width light bar that is all the rage these days. You also get a lot of blue ‘electricity’ accents around the car to make it visually different from the 7 Series. You get one of the nicest-feeling interiors around in the i7, with lots of leather – or vegan leather if you prefer – alongside crystally controls for the seat adjustment and gear lever. There’s also a lovely crystal strip that lights up depending on the climate control or interior ambience. Watch: BMW i7 M70 review But the highlight of the i7 is the optional cinema widescreen in the back. Folding down from the roof, it can stream your favourite shows or films on-demand, and it’s all controlled via voice commands or a door-mounted touchscreen. You can also get business class-style rear seats that recline to make you feel even more at home and comfortable on long drives. The main point of the i7 isn’t the boot space, but you still get 500 litres to work with. You can’t fold the seats down to increase load capacity, which is a shame, and the i7 loses 25 litres compared to the plug-in hybrid 7 Series models. It’s also considerably down on the Mercedes EQS, which offers 610 litres. The compact battery pack has a 102kWh capacity, and with that you can go up to 388 miles on a single charge. That is quite a way off the best for the Mercedes EQS, which can do up to 441 miles. The best-looking version of the i7 is easily the M Sport, and if you can get it with two-tone paint, do so. It helps take the sting out of the divisive front grille Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Out on the road, the i7 starts to surpass the Mercedes EQS, as well as some other big high-end EVs like the Tesla Model S. With the adaptive air suspension setup, bumps are barely noticeable and you’ll have next to no trouble on a long journey, where you can use the adaptive cruise control to make for a serene drive. There’s no hiding that in town it feels all of its 5.4m, but with the help of all around cameras, you’ll be able to make smooth progress. The instant electric power also makes getting in and out of junctions easy. The i7 can also park itself while you keep an eye on your surroundings. On the whole, the i7 is a comfortable and an accomplished limo that the Mercedes EQS and Tesla Model S will struggle to match. Although the Mercedes will go further on a charge, the i7 manages to be more fun to drive and packed with even more kit. While it may divide opinions with its looks, it's definitely the leader in the premium electric market. If you like what you see, check out the latest BMW i7 deals available through Carwow.

bmw,general,"Is the BMW XM a good car? If you’re after a high-performance SUV, you’re currently spoilt for choice. Porsche, Lamborghini, and even Tesla have produced performance SUVs, but BMW’s M division was yet to have a proper go – until now. This is the BMW XM. Soon to be tussling with the Ferrari Purosangue, Lamborghini Urus Performante, Porsche Cayenne Turbo GT and Tesla Model X Plaid, the BMW XM is the first M Division-only car since the 70s (Yes there are other M-labelled SUVs – like the X5 M and X6 M – but the XM is an M-exclusive model) and it’s again jumping on current trends – this time it’s big, brash SUVs. It’s like deciding which bubble tea flavour to go for – all have different characteristics and suit different people. Where the XM certainly divides opinion is how it looks. It’s not a pretty car, to be blunt, with BMW doubling down on the huge kidney grilles, which now come with lights on the inside. You also get split headlights at the front, while you get a squarer design down the side. You can choose between 21-, 22- and 23-inch alloys – with the larger ones likely to fill the arches better – while the blocky design continues at the rear. You get thin taillights, quad tailpipes, a rear diffuser and BMW logos etched into the rear, all adding to the sporty nature. The cabin is much less controversial. It’s tidy, modern and features a sweeping screen holding both the driver’s display and infotainment touchscreen. You can get tasteful all-black or less tasteful two-tone upholstery to adorn the cabin alongside many other M features to make it even more obvious that it’s a special model – like the steering wheel-mounted M buttons and M-specific gear lever. Watch: Audi SQ8 v BMW XM v Lamborghini Urus v Mercedes-AMG G 63 With its square body shape and measuring 5.1m long, there’s loads of head and legroom, making it good for those wanting to carry passengers for the day-to-day family commute or for a fun countryside blast. The boot is 527 litres, which compared to its main rivals is about average. The Tesla Model X Plaid has over 1,100 litres with five seats in place, while the BMW also falls behind the Porsche Cayenne Turbo GT (549 litres) and Lamborghini Urus Performante (616 litres). It only beats the Ferrari Purosangue, which has a 473-litre boot. From launch, the plug-in hybrid XM will come with a 4.4-litre twin-turbocharged V8 paired with an electric motor developing 653hp and 800Nm of torque. The sprint from 0-60mph takes just 4.3 seconds and it can reach a limited top speed of 155mph. That limiter can be raised to 168mph. But if you want BMW’s most powerful road car ever in its punchiest form, you’ll want to wait for the Label Red version. It uses the same setup, but power is upped to 748hp and 1,000Nm of torque, promising even more impressive performance. The hybrid system for both includes a 25.7kWh battery pack that delivers up to 55 miles of electric-only driving. Charging on AC only, its max charging rate is 7.4kW and it takes a little under four and a half hours to fully charge. When you drive on electric, you do get less punch than you get with the petrol engine involved, but it makes town driving very easy. The steering is responsive and light enough, while the suspension soaks up most bumps and cracks in the road. The XM is practical and rapid, but it lacks the driving prestige of a proper M car Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer There’s limited tyre noise from the huge wheels and the overall refinement is excellent, making long-distance driving a relaxing affair. Having the hybrid setup helps with fuel consumption, but it’ll be nowhere near BMW’s claimed figure of 188.3mpg because most won’t charge the electric system up often enough. To make sure it doesn’t feel too firm when you’re driving this 2,710kg SUV, BMW has fitted its adaptive M suspension setup so you can soften the ride for longer drives, and firm it up when you want to attack a road. However, you still feel a lot of lean on twistier roads even with this harder setup. There is plenty of performance offered by the 653hp power system, but when going for harder acceleration, the automatic transmission is hesitant to respond quickly enough, which takes away from the experience a little. You can fix this by using manual mode, but this issue makes it feel less like a flagship M car. While there are some admirable features that make the XM a cool car, it lacks some of the excitement of its rivals and doesn’t quite live up to the flagship M car billing as many would have hoped. If you’re after a great deal on a new XM or other new BMWs, you should use carwow – and if you want to change your car altogether, you can sell your car with us to help put money towards your next one.

mercedes,general,"Is the Mercedes A-Class a good car? Much like a Prada key chain or a silver-plated Gucci necklace, the A-Class is the most affordable way to get behind the wheel of a posh Mercedes. It serves as an alternative to the BMW 1 Series and Audi A3, often if you’re after the practicality of a Volkswagen Golf but with a bit more badge appeal when you’re sat in traffic - or posting on Instagram. It’s quite the looker too –the A-Class really does stand out against its premium alternatives. A wide-set grille, pointy headlights and curvy body lines are suitably different to the designed-with-a-ruler A3 and Golf, and the latest 1 Series can easily be mistaken for something less premium than a BMW. The dashboard has a two-tier design, curving away from the front seats, with intricate jet engine-esque air vents and a wide pair of digital displays in between them. It looks modern and sleek, and is a vast improvement over the interiors in earlier A-Class models. Group test: Audi A3 v BMW 1 Series v Mercedes A-Class v Volkswagen Golf The infotainment system is easy to use, with crisp graphics and a menu layout that’s easy to wrap your head around, plus Apple CarPlay/Android Auto connectivity comes as standard. The touch-sensitive controls on the steering wheel are a bit of a faff though; normal buttons would be much easier to use. There’s lots of storage space up front and the seats are comfy, but it’s a tight squeeze in the back; the 350-litre boot lags behind the 1 Series, A3 and Golf too. It’s a shame that the material quality inside the A-Class can’t match its stylish design, because the trim pieces feel flimsy and there are far too many scratchy plastics for a ‘premium’ hatchback. The A-Class is powered by a choice of petrol, diesel and self-charging hybrid engines - all front-wheel drive - from the A180 through to the A250e. If you want something a little spicier with a bit more shove, consider the 320hp A35 AMG and range topping 421hp A45 AMG are available. There’s a definite appeal to the three-pointed star on its steering wheel, but the A-Class is a case of style over substance Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer It’s comfortable around town; darty thanks to a tight turning circle and light steering, though the A-Class isn’t hugely refined on the motorway with noticeable wind and road noise in the cabin - even if it absorbs bumps well. AMG Line models are the least comfortable due to their larger wheels, and while they look sporty, a BMW 1 Series is much more fun on a twisty road. You’ll need to really want a Mercedes on your driveway to choose an A-Class over its alternatives, but if you value stylish looks and a sleek interior highly then it’s certainly an enticing prospect.

mercedes,general,"Is the Mercedes B-Class a good car? The Mercedes B-Class is like the geeky younger brother to the A-Class hatchback and the CLA four-door coupe. While those cars are strutting their sharper styling and popularity, the B-Class kind of hangs back and sits in the corner, even though it’s way more of a practical family car than either of those. In fact, the B-Class is way more practical than most other cars of its size, with lots of rear seat legroom and headroom, and a huge and versatile boot. It’s just a shame that there was never a seven seat option for the B-Class. We’ve mentioned the A-Class and the CLA, and the B-Class shares a chassis with both of those cars, plus its engines and its interior. The B is much taller and boxier than either of its siblings though, even if it’s not quite tall enough, nor boxy enough, to be a true MPV. Certainly, alternatives such as the Citroen Berlingo and Volkswagen Caddy Life have even more interior space, and for less money than the Merc. However, being related to the A-Class has its perks, and the B-Class has an impressive interior which, even if it’s not at the cutting edge of Mercedes technology right now, has big, useful screens and a sense of high quality. That sense of quality is almost undone by some cheap items, such as the column stalks behind the steering wheel, but the rest of the cabin is good enough to make up for glitches like that. There’s plenty of space, and the same comfortable and supportive seats that you’d find in the A-Class. Classy, and roomy enough for most families, but the BMW 2 Series Active Tourer is sharper to drive Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer There’s also the same pair of ‘MBUX’ digital screens stretched out across the dashboard, like someone took a rolling pin to an iPad. Both screens measure 10.25-inches across, and the driver’s display screen is actually more customisable, in terms of how it looks, than you’d find in the more recent Mercedes models. The software is also simpler to use, and it helps that there are proper buttons for the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning. Space in the back is excellent too, with stretch-out space for anyone sitting in the outer two rear seats, although anyone stuck in the middle definitely gets the short straw. It’s a shame Mercedes never created a seven-seat B-Class. After all, if the related GLB SUV can have seven seats… The boot’s not massive, but with more than 400 litres on offer, it’s much roomier than that of the A-Class hatchback and beats the likes of a Volkswagen Golf by 60 litres. However, the Mercedes can’t compete with the massive boots offered by the Berlingo or Caddy. Neither the Berlingo nor Caddy can match the way the Mercedes drives, though. Again, being related to the A-Class is a distinct strength and while you do sit up higher than in the A-Class, the B-Class has impressive resistance to body roll in corners, and nicely-set-up steering that’s actually fairly enthusiastic. However, the B-Class can’t compete with the — more expensive — BMW 2 Series Active Tourer, which is much sharper to drive again. Both cars suffer from having a slightly-too-firm-ride though, which can make the B-Class annoyingly bumpy around town. The B-Class range has been reduced somewhat of late, so now there’s only two engines from which to pick — a mild hybrid B200 with a 1.3-litre turbo petrol engine, or a 2.0-litre diesel.

mercedes,general,"Is the Mercedes C-Class a good car? The Mercedes C-Class is a popular, posh small saloon car that would be alongside the BMW 3 Series and the Audi A4 on your new car shopping list. In the past, you would have picked the C-Class over those other two if you preferred comfort and luxury over sportiness. Where you could think of the athletic BMW as a pair of high-tech running shoes, the C-Class has always been more like a pair of expensive slippers. But this new C-Class – just like every other Mercedes saloon – looks a fair bit sportier than it did before. In fact now more than ever, you could view the Mercedes saloon car range as a set of Russian dolls. The outside layer would obviously be the ultra-luxurious S-Class, but if you opened it up you’d find the E-Class, the C-Class and even the A-Class saloon all tucked away inside. That miniaturised S-Class trend continues on the inside, too. The general look and feel of the cabin is seriously plush, thanks to an abundance of leather and the availability of some snazzy ambient lighting. There’s still the odd bit of cheaper-feeling plastic in the lower reaches of the cabin, but generally speaking it oozes visual pizazz. Group Test: Audi A4 v BMW 3 Series v DS9 v Genesis G70 v Mercedes C-Class Technology is also a strong point, as the large central touchscreen brings plenty of features including smartphone connectivity and voice control. It all looks futuristic, and the screen’s graphics are exceptionally clear and slick. The C-Class’ cabin is more spacious than before as well, with more headroom and legroom in the second row. There’s plenty of adjustment in the front too, so four adults should easily be able to get comfortable on longer journeys. Its boot isn’t as big as in a BMW 3 Series, but there are a handful of practical touches and lots of storage space inside the car. The engine range is good, with smooth and punchy motors that suit lots of different uses. If you do lots of motorway miles you’ll want to take a look at one of the diesels; while the plug-in hybrid model offers super low running costs if you charge it up regularly. There are a couple of more affordable four-cylinder petrol engines available, too. The Mercedes C-Class is all about tech and comfort, so if you don’t need the sharp handling of a BMW 3 Series, it’s the saloon to buy Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Which engine to go for depends on your needs. but most people will be best served with the C200 petrol or C220d diesel. The C300d is punchy but still a four-cylinder, so no more refined, while the C300e hybrid is clever and efficient if charged regularly, but pricey to buy. The C-Class is comfortable too, dealing with lumps and bumps very well. It’s not as sharp to drive as a BMW 3 Series but it’s not too far off, so the new Mercedes is a better all-rounder than it was before. If you want a saloon that’s comfortable and packed with the latest technology, the Mercedes C-Class is a great option.

mercedes,general,"Is the Mercedes E-Class a good car? If you want a posh saloon car that’s packed full of technology and is really comfortable for long drives, the Mercedes E-Class is an excellent option. Although its exterior design hasn't been overhauled for the new model, it still looks and feels expensive inside and out. It’s a bit like a Herman Miller office chair. It might be priced towards middle-aged buyers with more disposable income, but if you’re willing and able to afford it, you get to sit in high style and comfort. And comfort really is the name of the game inside the E-Class. It’s easy to get a good driving position thanks to lots of adjustability in the seat and steering wheel. There’s loads of space and it’s practical whether you’re sitting in the front or the back, with good-sized cubby holes and cup holders that adjust to different-sized bottles. The boot is disappointingly small in hybrid models, but it’s usefully big in the petrol and diesel models, with more capacity than a BMW 5 Series and Audi A6 Saloon. Watch: Audi A6 v BMW 5 Series v Mercedes E-Class It’s not just good old-fashioned space and comfort, though. You also get loads of new-age tech, with the highlight being the optional Superscreen. This has your typical central infotainment screen plus a second display in front of the passenger, all under one sweeping section of glass. It’s quick, responsive and easy to use, but reflections can be really annoying on the move. There are also a few cheap materials in the cabin, which take the shine off the generally flashy design. While the changes are pretty comprehensive inside, it’s more a case of evolution than revolution outside. The Mercedes E-Class doesn’t look drastically different to its predecessor, but it still looks stylish, with lashings of chrome and a new front grille that incorporates the Mercedes star to good effect. Going for the Exclusive trim makes it look more like a baby S-Class, too. Out on the road you won’t find it’s a case of style over substance either. The Mercedes E-Class is incredibly comfortable and you'll barely notice bumps in the road, though it’s worth noting our test car did have the optional adaptive suspension. This is a box that’s definitely worth ticking. It’s a similar story on the motorway, where comfort and refinement are the order of the day. You’ll barely hear the engine in the background and the E-Class insulates you from the wind and road noise outside. The optional air suspension makes pockmarked city streets feel silky smooth – it’s an option box well worth ticking Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer This was, at least, the case with the plug-in hybrid model we tested. It was the lesser-powered of two such PHEVs, both of which can travel about 70 miles on a charge and are ideal if you can charge at home or at work and spend a lot of time driving in the city. There’s also a petrol and diesel available for those who do more miles or don’t have easy access to a charger. Choosing one of those hybrids will raise the price of purchase, but they really do suit the relaxing nature of the E-Class driving experience. And much like that Herman Miller chair, if they’re within your budget, you won’t regret the purchase when you’re sitting in comfort. Want to see how much you could save?

mercedes,general,"Is the Mercedes S-Class a good car? The Mercedes S-Class is a luxury saloon that has frequently earned the title of ‘best car in the world’, as well as winning a 2023 carwow Buy It award for this latest all-new version. The S-Class is a pioneer because it always showcases the latest Mercedes technology before it filters down through the rest of the range. Still, using the latest tech in this luxurious high-tech limo is always special – it’s like hearing music as it was meant to be played by a live orchestra rather than streamed on your phone. The S-Class has been updated for 2021 so it comes with even more to set it apart from an Audi A8, BMW 7 Series or Lexus LS. And it has done so. It doesn’t look radically different from the previous model, mind you, but it does feature quite a few traits shared with other recently updated Mercedes models. The new grille and rounder headlights look like they’ve been lifted from the latest E-Class, for example. Mercedes has smashed it out of the park with the interior of the S-Class. Shame the exterior isn't as opulent Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer From the side, the new S-Class has fewer creases than the old car. This makes it look smoother, but also a little like an elongated E-Class. And, at the back, the new brake lights look very similar to the triangular lights you get on a CLS. What’s cool is that the flush-fitting door handles pop out when the car senses that you’re nearby. And once you get inside, the new S-Class looks completely different from any other Mercedes. You can get the S-Class interior with a load of different trims, including a gorgeous wooden design with vertical metal bars. It looks like a vintage speed boat got frisky with a grand piano. All this wood looks especially good with the car’s new mood lighting turned on. And, just like before, you can get the S-Class with a panoramic glass roof to make its massive cabin feel even airier inside. Of course, space in the front and back is superb, and there’s even a long wheelbase version if the standard back seats feel a bit poky. The main thing you’ll notice inside is the new touchscreen. This huge screen replaces 27 of the old S-Class’s physical buttons, including the central touchpad. The touchscreen can tell where your finger is even before you’ve pressed it, and it gives haptic feedback which makes it easier to use on the move. You can even lock the screen using fingerprint or face recognition so there’s no chance of your passengers fiddling with anything while you’re out of the car. The new Mercedes S-Class will be available with five power options: three six-cylinder, 3.0-litre engines – a petrol and two diesels, all with a nine-speed automatic gearbox, plus an ultra-efficient plug-in hybrid is also available. Also as standard is adaptive air suspension, so the only thing more comfortable is likely to be a velvet-lined waterbed. Better still, it manages to combine a really cosseting drive and pin-drop silence with decent capability on winding country roads. It’s actually fairly agile, although a BMW 7 Series is probably a little bit more engaging to drive. Mind you, who cares when many S-Class owners are likely to be experiencing life from the back seat. The S-Class also comes with some unique safety features. For starters, there’s an optional back-seat airbag that gives passengers in the back of long-wheelbase models similar protection to the driver in a head-on collision. It is also capable of level 3 autonomous driving, meaning it can accelerate, brake, steer and change lanes for you on motorways. So, the ‘best car in the world’ just got even better.

mercedes,general,"Is the a Mercedes CLA good car? The Mercedes CLA Coupe is a sportier-looking option for those who want something more stylish than the already pretty stylish Mercedes A-Class. The two cars share plenty of features inside and under the bonnet, though, and from the front, the two are hard to tell apart. From the side, however, the Mercedes CLA Coupe looks more like Mercedes’ larger CLS model that’s shrunk in the wash. The ground-hugging bumpers, angular brake lights and curved windows all look like they belong on something much bigger and much more expensive. On the inside, things look just as dramatic. No matter which one you go for you get a huge dual-screen infotainment system (as seen in the A-Class) and there’s plenty of ambient lighting which helps show off the brushed metal trims and gorgeous turbine-like air vents. You also get Mercedes’ latest MBUX infotainment system as standard. Its party trick is its ability to offer augmented reality satellite navigation. It takes a live video feed from the camera on the CLA Coupe’s front bumper and overlays directions to help you take the right turning at confusing junctions. If you love the Mercedes A-Class’ clever technology but fancy something a little more eye-catching, the CLA Coupe could be the car for you Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The Mercedes CLA Coupe is more than just a load of clever tech – it’s also really comfortable, at least upfront. You get leather seats as standard and they get lots of support in all directions and in the right places. The back seats are a bit different if you are taller than the average, though. The boot is a pretty good size – it’s got more room than the boxier load bay in the A-Class but getting bulky things in is trickier because of the narrow and awkward opening. The CLA Shooting Brake sibling car is a better bet for carrying more stuff. It’s unlikely you’ll buy the CLA Coupe to do weekly tip runs though, and it’s more at home enjoying itself down some back roads. One notable upgrade over the A-Class is the rear suspension. You get a more advanced setup that makes it feel more agile. There are two quiet and economical petrols – both 1.3-litre engines – and a 2.0-litre diesel engine to choose from in the standard range. There’s also a plug-in hybrid which will suit company car drivers or private buyers who can recharge at home. For those who want more pace and power, the CLA 35 and CLA 45 promise 306hp and 421hp respectively and all the performance that goes with it. You can also get the Mercedes CLA Coupe with the same high-tech driver assistance systems as the standard A-Class to help make long stints behind the wheel feel like popping to the shops. In many respects, then, the CLA Coupe is very similar to the more affordable A-Class. But, if you’re looking for something more fun to drive that prioritises style over spaciousness – the Mercedes CLA is well worth considering.

mercedes,general,"Is the Mercedes CLS a good car? The Mercedes CLS is the kind of car that will appeal to people who want to have their cake and eat it. After all, it’s described as a four-door coupe, and sets out to do something that sounds almost impossible: to combine the best bits of both types of car. On the one hand, in the interior, you get something approaching the high-class cabin and practicality you’d expect of a Mercedes executive saloon such as the E- or S-Class; and, on the other hand, it’s all dressed up in a body that’s very deliberately designed to look like a Mercedes coupe. This is a relatively new concept, but Mercedes can claim to have created it with the first Mercedes CLS, back in 2003. This is the third generation of the car and it follows very much the same recipe as the previous ones, offering an alternative to the likes of the Audi A7, Volkswagen Arteon and BMW 4 Series Gran Coupe, as well sportier posh saloons, such as the Jaguar XF. Where this latest one differs from the old Mercedes CLS models is that its body is much smoother, with fewer lines and creases in the metal. When it comes to choosing the colour of your leather upholstery, Mercedes clearly follows the Henry Ford principle: you can have any colour as long as it’s black. As are the steering wheel, dashboard, door trims, parcel shelf, roof lining and carpet... Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Engine choices are a couple of six-cylinder diesels (350d and 400d), a 2.0-litre petrol (350), a 3.0-litre 299hp petrol (450) and the CLS 53, which is powered by a 3.0-litre, 435bhp petrol engine. All petrol engines are supported by a small electric hybrid system. You don’t have to spend a lot of time driving the CLS to realise that it excels as a very safe high-speed cruiser that will cover huge distances in complete comfort, with very little apparent effort from the engines. Stick to motorways and main roads, and you’ll really be playing it to its strengths. Only if you expect it to behave like a genuine sports car along a tight B-road will you be disappointed with the way it drives. Ultimately, there’s no getting away from the fact that this is a big car. Likewise, you’ll be disappointed if you’re expecting the same degree of space and practicality you’ll find in, say, an E-Class, but the CLS is still a decent four-seater, and you can fit a reasonable amount in the boot, too. If you're in the market for a Mercedes CLS then head over to our deals page, or if you'd like a used CLS then check out our used page.",,Carwow
mercedes,general,"Is the Mercedes GLA a good car? The GLA is the smallest SUV in the Mercedes range, and it’s essentially an A-Class with a raised ride height and chunky 4x4-esque styling. It’s a bit like Danny DeVito wearing platforms and puffing his chest out. Once you’ve got over that curious image, your Mercedes GLA cross-shopping list should also include other small premium SUVs, such as the BMW X1, Audi Q3, Volvo XC40 and Range Rover Evoque. Mercedes introduced an updated GLA in 2023, which tweaked the already stylish exterior to make it look a bit more rugged, with a new front bumper design showing off the underbody protection. Off-roader chic in a car that will probably never venture further off the beaten track than a gravel driveway, but it looks good all the same. This stylish appearance continues inside, with a sweeping twin-screen setup for the instruments and infotainment. Mercedes is one of the best in the business for its infotainment system, which gets sharp graphics and easy-to-navigate menus. You also get wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay as standard, and can choose between different instrument displays from classic, minimalist looks to sportier designs. Interior quality is pretty good too, with artificial leather upholstery and nice materials on the dashboard. It’s easy to find scratchier plastics lower down, though. The Mercedes GLA is a spacious small SUV with great on-board tech, but the BMW X1 has a bigger boot and is more fun to drive Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer What’s more impressive is how spacious it is inside. This is quite a small SUV, but you won’t feel cooped up in the front or the back. It’s not all good on the practicality front though, because while the 485-litre boot is bigger than that available in a Volvo XC40, it’s smaller than both the BMW X1 and Audi Q3. There’s a good range of engines to choose from, with a petrol, two diesels and a plug-in hybrid, as well as two high-performance AMG models. Most people will be well-served by the petrol, called GLA 200, because it’s the least expensive to buy and offers decent fuel economy. The plug-in hybrid’s low benefit-in-kind rating will make it the go-to for company car buyers, though. Like the idea of the GLA but want an electric car? The Mercedes EQA is worth a look, though it’s far from the best small electric SUV. Whichever GLA model you go for, it’s great for driving around town. The raised driving position gives a clear view of the road ahead, and you have good visibility all around the car. The steering is nice and light, which makes tight manoeuvres easier, but the flip side is that the GLA isn’t the most rewarding car to drive down a fun road – unless you go for one of the AMG models, that is. Those versions aren’t particularly comfortable nor economical. Stick to the regular models and the suspension happily irons out bumps and potholes in the road, while cruising around at motorway speeds is pretty quiet and relaxing. Couple this with the high-tech interior and the Mercedes GLA is a decent posh SUV, but it’s not as well-rounded as the BMW X1 or Audi Q3. Still, if this is the car for you, check out the latest Mercedes GLA deals, or see how much you can save on a used GLA.

mercedes,general,"Is the Mercedes-Benz GLB a good car? The Mercedes GLB is a family SUV with enough space inside for seven. It looks a little like the lovechild of Mercedes’ boxy brute the G-Class and its largest SUV the GLS, making the GLB come across as quite the little upstart with attitude. Unlike the Land Rover Discovery Sport, Kia Sorento and Skoda Kodiaq, the Mercedes GLB is quite small for a seven-seater. But, there’s still enough space on its boxy body to pack plenty of chrome, loads of plastic faux-air vents and a whopping great front grille. Combined, these features make it look more like a baby GLS than an overblown hatchback. Step inside, and you’ll be greeted by an equally posh-looking interior. The Mercedes GLB’s cabin looks a bit like it was drawn by someone copying the A-Class’ homework, but with enough changes to make sure they avoid getting put in design detention. The familiar five brushed-metal air vents look fantastic and most of the materials feel nice and yielding. All models get a 10.3-inch infotainment display with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone mirroring as standard, but it’s a shame that only top-spec cars come with electrically adjustable seats. There’s plenty of room in the front five seats for adults to get comfy, but the sixth and seventh seats are only big enough for kids and the Mercedes GLB’s boot can’t match that in a Discovery Sport or Skoda Kodiaq. If you mainly drive around town, go for the 200 petrol, but we think the 220d diesel in AMG line trim will suit the majority. Head to our deals page for the best price! Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer The Mercedes has the edge over these cars when driving in town, however. Its smaller size makes it fairly easy to manoeuvre and it’ll soak up the thud of large potholes pretty well, too. Other SUVs are quieter to travel in at motorway speeds, however, and the Mercedes GLB doesn’t come with a great many engines to choose from. That said, the 200 petrol model is perfectly suited to pottering around town and the 220d makes a good motorway cruiser. Neither, however, makes the Mercedes GLB particularly good fun to drive on a twisty back road, and you’ll have to pay extra for a top-spec car if you fancy a full suite of driver assistance systems. If you’re happy to fork out for a few optional extras and want your practical SUV to be more comfortable and stylish than it is sporty, you should consider the Mercedes GLB. Sure, alternatives are cheaper and more practical, but few small SUVs can transport seven people as stylishly as the GLB.

mercedes,general,"Is the Mercedes GLC a good car? The Mercedes GLC is a premium mid-size SUV that’s inspired by the C-Class saloon but offers a higher view of the road and chunkier styling. It's an alternative to the likes of the Audi Q5, BMW X3, Porsche Macan and Volvo XC60. But like a Swatch watch, the GLC has some quality parts that will make it a popular choice, but it does surprise with some less-than-quality elements. Looks-wise, the Mercedes is arguably the best-looking of the medium-sized premium SUVs. It has a presence, with the wide bar spanning the grille, completed by the glossy Mercedes badge sitting on top. You also get sporty elements, as all UK models come with AMG-inspired trim levels. The car sits on 19- or 20-inch alloys - the larger alloys fill the wheel arches better - while there’s lots of chrome detailing to give off a high-end feel. At the rear, there’s some fakery with the exhaust openings, but on the whole, there’s again a strong presence and the GLC looks pretty good. The cabin continues Mercedes’ excellent form of making great environments to be. You get two large displays that are clear, easy to use and customisable. The design is also pleasing to the eye, although where the GLC can feel less premium than its rather large price tag is the scratchy plastics at common touchpoints, like the gear stalk and in the centre console. Watch: Audi Q5 v BMW X3 v Mercedes GLC v Volvo XC60 In the back seats you’ll find plenty of head and legroom, even with the panoramic sunroof in place. There’s a large hump in the floor that can limit foot space, but sitting three across the back is okay. The front chairs can prevent easy child seat fitting with a top-heavy design that can block rear-facing seats. The boot space does vary somewhat depending on whether the GLC is a plug-in hybrid or not. You get 600 litres of space with a flat floor and underfloor storage in the petrol and diesel models, while choosing the plug-in versions drops the capacity to 400 litres and no underfloor storage due to the 31.2kWh battery. Alternatives like the Audi Q5 (550 litres), BMW X3 (550 litres) and Porsche Macan (500 litres) all post much less capacity, while the Volvo XC60’s 635 litres makes it the only premium rival that beats the GLC. Sacrificing the boot space could be a good choice though, as the plug-in hybrids – especially the petrol we tested – can offer an excellent driving experience. With up to 80 miles of charge available from both the diesel and petrol models, you get a lot of zero-emission travel and you can get up to 87mph on electric power alone. The PHEVs are the punchiest models available, with the petrol offering 335hp and the diesel developing 328hp. The 300d diesel is the closest non-plug-in option with 280hp. I wouldn’t normally recommend PHEVs, but the GLC plug-ins are excellent for day-to-day use Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer With that serene drive setup, it works wonderfully around town. Yes, there’s an additional 400kg of weight to carry compared to the non-plug-in versions, but the GLC is comfy and composed and the suspension deals with most bumps well. On faster roads, the nine-speed automatic gearbox can be a little hesitant under acceleration, but the hybrid’s electric motor fills most gaps if you want instant performance. Besides that, the GLC is quiet, with only a little bit of road noise intruding. With the petrol-electric combo, it’s also pretty efficient on longer journeys. Twistier roads aren’t where the GLC is at home, but it’s composed enough. It’s not fun like a Porsche Macan, but it hides its weight well enough in Sport mode. With all things considered, the Mercedes GLC is an accomplished family SUV with lots of space for all and could be an excellent all-round option.

mercedes,general,"Is the Mercedes GLE a good car? If you want a luxurious SUV that focuses more on being comfortable than being sporty, the Mercedes GLE is certainly worth adding to your shortlist. It’s a big, imposing seven-seater that’s really spacious inside and has a great selection of engines, but there are loads of posh SUVs that are also worth considering, such as the BMW X5, Audi Q7 and Volvo XC90 – and all of them cost less. Despite its muscular appearance, the Mercedes GLE is offered with a frugal plug-in hybrid engine, so it’s a bit like Arnold Schwarzenegger on a vegan diet. And much like the famous Austrian, the GLE doesn’t exactly blend into everyday life. An update in 2023 gave it a slightly different look, with new lights and a new grille, as well as alloy wheels up to 22 inches in size, but it’s just as handsome and eye-catching as ever, and you won’t lose it in a supermarket car park. The inside more than lives up to the exterior, too. There’s loads of leather and wood – though it’s all fake for eco-friendly reasons, you’d never know so it’s still suitably classy. That said, a BMW X5 just feels a touch more upmarket. Group test: Audi Q7 v BMW X5 v Mercedes GLE v Porsche Cayenne v VW Touareg To help make sure all this wood and leather doesn’t make the Mercedes GLE feel like a stuffy old country club, it also comes with one of the best infotainment systems in the business, courtesy of two sweeping displays atop the dashboard. It’s all very easy to use and responds to your touch quicker than most alternatives. It’s not form over function, though, because there’s loads of space in the front and back with plenty of cubby holes, including nifty heated and cooled cupholders. However, the boot is 630 litres, which is smaller than all alternatives bar the Lexus RX. It should be big enough for most situations, though, and when the third row of seats are folded down you get a flat load area. There are some compromises here for the plug-in hybrid, though – the boot capacity drops, you don’t get reclining rear seats and there’s no seven-seat option. But these are common issues among hybrid alternatives, to be fair. Where the plug-in version makes a case for itself is running costs. It has an official electric range of over 60 miles, but even the more realistic 40 miles you see in the real world means that if you can keep the batteries charged, most people could commute without ever needing the petrol engine. The Mercedes GLE is a big, comfortable, posh SUV, with excellent on-board technology, too Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer If you can’t keep it charged – or won’t benefit from the low company car cost – there’s a non-hybrid petrol and two diesels, which might suit you better. There are also high-performance AMG 53 and AMG 63 S versions if running costs are less of a concern… The AMG models are the most fun in corners, thanks to having more power and a sportier suspension, but regardless, you’ll want a BMW X5 or Porsche Cayenne if twisty road enjoyment is top of the agenda. Where the Mercedes GLE makes more sense is cruising quietly and comfortably around town and on the motorway. The steering is light and it’s really manoeuvrable for such a big car, while running on electric power in the hybrid makes it particularly quiet, too. Although it doesn’t particularly excel in any area, the Mercedes GLE is still a compelling option. It looks great and has a lovely interior, with enough practicality for most, even if alternatives offer more capacity. Interested?

mercedes,general,"Is the Mercedes GLS a good car? With more and more people driving around in high-riding 4x4s, it’s becoming increasingly difficult to look down one’s nose at the general public from the back of large luxury saloons. The Mercedes GLS solves this first-world problem – it’s gigantic in every way, and it’s essentially the Mercedes S-Class of SUVs. It’s a bit like a Gucci handbag compared with a Gucci purse; both are very posh and very expensive, but one is a bit bigger and more practical than the other. But just how gigantic is it? Well, the GLS is longer than a BMW X7, though it’s about the same as a full-size Range Rover. You also won’t mistake it for either of those, because it has a Mercedes badge the size of a dinner plate on its grille – now even larger courtesy of an update in 2023 – between LED headlights and above large air intakes. At the side are huge alloy wheel options up to 23 inches, box wheel arches and illuminated running boards, while at the back, you’ll find a roof spoiler at the top and LED rear lights. It's all very big and imposing, but there's not a huge amount of difference compared with pre-update models. What's more, our test car had gaps between some panels and a boot that was misaligned, as well as condensation in the headlights. Annoying in a family hatchback, disappointing in a luxury SUV... Group test: Mercedes GLS v Tesla Model X v BMW X7 Subtle updates inside don't change the fact that the GLS has a more visually engaging interior design than a BMW X7 or Audi Q7. For starters, it has a huge one-piece screen for the instruments and infotainment flanked by two massive air vents. Below that sit four further squared vents set into wood or metal trim. It’s not all good news, though – some of the car’s switches feel too flimsy for a car at this price level and there are some cheaper-feeling plastics at the bottom of the dashboard and doors. A Range Rover feels much more posh inside. Still, Mercedes’ MBUX infotainment system is one of the best on sale, and the introduction of the latest version only cements its place atop the podium. It’s also one of the coolest-looking setups around, with two huge screens that merge together to form one wide wraparound display through which you control everything from the climate control to the built-in sat-nav. There are no issues with interior space, though. The Mercedes GLS is a proper seven-seater, meaning two adults will be comfortable in all three rows, and even three sat side-by-side in the middle row won’t complain too much – though an X7 is roomier with seven on-board. The GLS’s boot is massive, too, whichever configuration you have it in; even with all seven seats in place, there’s more space than a Mercedes A-Class, and in five-seat mode it has more than an X7 or Range Rover. Mercedes calls the GLS the 'S-Class of SUVs' and it's comfy and quiet enough to live up to that billing. It's just a shame it doesn't feel as high quality inside in places Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer You can choose between a petrol or a diesel engine with the standard GLS, while the high-end Mercedes-Maybach and AMG versions feature high-powered petrol engines. It's a shame there's no plug-in hybrid version for company car buyers. Regardless, both engines offer punchy power that comes in handy for sprinting down motorway slip roads to join traffic, and once the GLS is at a cruise it proves extremely quiet and comfortable for the most part – though the air suspension can feel like it's almost skipping over bumps from time to time. On country roads, the X7 is a more agile SUV, but there isn’t much in it and nobody is buying these cars for the way they go around corners. No, you’ll be more likely to see the GLS creeping around town, where its light steering, standard 360-degree cameras and parking aids make it easier to manoeuvre than you might think. So, the Mercedes GLS is the S-Class of SUVs in terms of its size, technology and wonderfully comfortable driving experience, if not quite its interior quality. Even so, if you’re convinced, make sure you check out our Mercedes GLS deals for the best prices. You can also browse the latest used GLS models or see what other used Mercedes are for sale.

mercedes,general,"Is the Mercedes G-Class a good car? The Mercedes G-Class is a premium SUV that’s capable of wafting you around in luxury and taking you almost anywhere off the beaten track. You’re more likely to see it on your local high street than out in the woods though – a lot like a pair of Hunter wellington boots. If you’re looking at a G-Class, you’ll probably have your eye on the Land Rover Defender, Porsche Cayenne and BMW X7 as well – all of which are capable alternatives. The looks of the G-Class are very retro and classic off-roader, with its boxy shape, round headlights and large windows, while you get silvery trim detailing too. For the cabin, you get a similar mix of premium and utilitarian. There’s a lot of leather upholstery options and brushed aluminium that can be teamed with either gloss black or open-pore wood trim, while there are two large screens for your driver’s display and infotainment touchscreen. You can fit five people in the cabin in comfort, with plenty of head and legroom for adults in the back – even your tallest mates will fit. Watch: New G63 AMG vs Old G63 off-road race While the 667-litre boot is very spacious, the Land Rover Defender 110 and Porsche Cayenne both have more space to work with. The three-door Defender 90 is much smaller though, while the seven-seat BMW X7 has less room with all the chairs in place. You can choose between the 440d diesel and the AMG-tuned G 63, both of which come with a nine-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel drive. If you want to use that all-wheel drive where it’ll show its worth, you get three differential locks to stop wheels spinning or slipping on loose surfaces. There are special driving modes suited to different situations too, such as Slippery and Sport+. Even if it’s well-suited to driving off Tarmac, the G-Class is supremely comfortable when you’re driving in town. You get adaptive damping on the suspension, which makes the G soft and comfortable over bumps – even at slower speeds. But as the body is quite chunky, getting in and out of small streets and car parks can be tricky. The new G-Class is a far cry from the old-fashioned model it replaces. It’s just as imposing to look at, even more luxurious inside and – in G 63 trim – faster than some supercars! Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer When you take the G-Class onto the motorway, you get a lot of safety assistance systems to take the strain out of long-distance driving. While the G-Class has a boxy shape that could mean a lot of wind noise, Mercedes has done an excellent job of insulating it from that. Take it on a twisty road and the G-Class does start to lean even with the adaptive suspension, but if you choose the AMG G 63, you get uprated brakes and sportier suspension components to make it more capable. A Porsche Cayenne or a BMW X7 are better at hustling down a back-road, though. Taking all of that into account, the Mercedes G-Class is an excellent selection in the premium SUV market with a high-end cabin and comfortable ride, although it is one of the more expensive options and isn’t quite as fun as alternatives.

You can check out the best used Mercedes deals with us too, while you can even sell your car through carwow to get the best price.",,Carwow
mercedes,general,"Is the Mercedes EQA a good car? The Mercedes EQA is a small-ish electric SUV, and an alternative to the likes of the BMW iX1 and Audi Q4 e-tron. You’re actually spoilt for choice for similar cars around the £50k price tag, with the likes of the Volkswagen ID4, Tesla Model Y and Skoda Enyaq all offering combinations of value, practicality and range. The EQA is based on the combustion-engined Mercedes GLA, and compared with that car it's a bit like meeting an android version of yourself. It looks really familiar, but it goes about things in a quieter and more efficient way. You can’t imagine the EQA having a laugh or telling rude jokes; it’s like a really sensible version of you. So how do you tell the difference between the two? Well the main difference can be found up front. With no hot engine under the bonnet to cool, Mercedes has removed the grille and replaced it with some shiny plastic. There is a small air intake lower down to help cool the batteries, just like on the bigger EQC, and the bumper was tweaked in early 2024 with a new design as part of a mid-life update. Mercedes EQA: electric range, battery and charging data Range: 260-346 milesEfficiency: 3.3-4.3 miles per kWhBattery size: 67kWh / 71kWhMax charge speed: 100kWCharge time AC: 9hrs 15mins, 10-100%, 7kW / 10hrs, 10-100%, 7kWCharge time DC: 32mins, 10-80%, 100kW / 35mins, 10-80%, 100kWCharge port location: Right rearPower outputs: 190hp / 228hp / 292hp It’s a bit trickier to tell the Mercedes EQA from the GLA when you look at it from the side, with this electric car having the same smooth, pebble-like shape as its petrol-powered stablemate. The EQA does come with some unique alloy wheels though, kicking off at 18 inches and rising to 20 inches. They’ve also been designed to cut through the air more efficiently than the GLA’s rims, helping to eke out a few more miles from a charge. The designers have been busy at the back, too. You get some new brake lights and a full-width light bar like at the front. And, because this takes up a lot of space on the bootlid, Mercedes had to move the number plate down onto the bumper instead. The EQA’s interior is basically the same as the GLA’s. It has the same simple layout and an almost identical dual-screen infotainment system as standard. This means you get two 10.0-inch displays that look great. There’s also the ‘Hey Mercedes’ voice command feature, which tries its best to understand commands spoken in plain English. This system isn’t as good as BMW’s personal assistant, though. The Mercedes EQA feels classy enough, but it’s really let down by its practicality Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Sat-nav comes as standard, and it’ll let you program routes according to where the fastest charging points are located, and how much charge you want to have in reserve when you arrive. There are four trim levels to choose from: Sport Executive, AMG Line Executive, AMG Line Premium and AMG Line Premium Plus. They have similar names and similar specifications, with even the base models getting most of the standard kit, short of augmented reality sat-nav, an upgraded sound system and wireless phone charging. You also have three battery and motor combinations to choose from. The EQA 250+ has the largest battery and front-wheel drive, and the result is the longest range in the line-up at up to 346 miles. The EQA 300 gets dual motors and a smaller battery, resulting in more power but a lower 266-mile range figure. You can get adaptive suspension on top-spec models, which lets you choose soft, comfortable settings, or firm everything up to make the EQA feel sportier to drive. It works well, dealing with road scars and speed bumps, but it’s not the most comfortable electric car you can buy. A Hyundai Ioniq 5 is more cosseting. Like the look of the Mercedes EQA?

mercedes,general,"Is the Mercedes EQB a good car? The Mercedes EQB is one of the few all-electric seven seaters on the market today. Based on the GLB, it’s a bit like a Victorian detached house which has been modernised with solar panels. It retains the charming style, but it’s a bit greener and cheaper to run. Those shopping for an all-electric seven-seater aren’t exactly spoilt for choice. Besides the EQB, you may also be looking at the more expensive Kia EV9 or something more utilitarian like a Citroen e-Spacetourer. The forthcoming Peugeot E-5008 is the closest comparison though. If you don’t need the extra pair of seats, you could consider a BMW iX1 or an Audi Q4 e-tron. To help tell this electric car apart from the GLB the grille has been blanked off with shiny plastic trim and a sleek-looking LED light bar runs between the re-shaped headlights. Elsewhere it’s more of a conventional SUV when compared to its smaller sibling, the EQA, with slab sides and a more square rear end design. Mercedes EQB: electric range, battery and charging data Range: 242-321 milesEfficiency: 3.2-3.9 miles per kWhBattery size: 67kWh / 71kWhMax charge speed: 100kWCharge time AC: 6hrs 30mins, 0-100%, 11kW / 5hrs 45mins, 0-100%, 11kWCharge time DC: 30mins, 10-100%, 100kWCharge port location: Right rearPower outputs: 188hp / 225hp / 288hp Step inside and you’ll find a suitably classy cabin, with an interesting two-step dashboard and plenty of posh-feeling materials around the place. You get a couple of 10.0-inch screens sitting proudly atop of the dashboard, and some models get a head-up display - all of which are very clear and easy to read. You won’t be wanting for more space inside either. That boxy shape affords great headroom, and legroom is pretty generous as well. The rearmost pair of seats are pretty tight, they’re only really suitable for children, but the middle row can slide forward to create an adequate amount of space for adults on shorter trips. This all-electric seven-seater is great for families, but just be careful of adding too much kit as it’s expensive enough already Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Being based on the petrol-powered GLB, a chunk of the EQB’s boot space has been taken up by the battery pack under the floor. As a result you get up to 495 litres of luggage space, down from 570 litres in the GLB. It may be slightly larger than the BMW iX1, but a Skoda Enyaq offers a lot more luggage space. Speaking of batteries, there are a couple to choose from. There’s a 70kWh pack which comes paired to a 190hp electric motor on the front wheels, and it’s this car which yields the most range at 321 miles. There are also a couple of dual-motor cars, both with a 66kWh battery and 255 miles of range. Those figures are pretty good, but the Skoda Enyaq, Ford Mustang Mach-E and forthcoming Peugeot E-5008 will all go further on a charge. From behind the wheel though, the EQB is arguably the most relaxing to drive out of all these alternatives. It’s manoeuvrable, the visibility is great over that square bonnet and the cabin is nicely hushed. Out on a twisty road the EQB handles itself quite well. There might not be much in the way of fun to be had, but it feels pretty secure through the corners and there’s not too much body roll. The suspension is on the firm side though, something which can make the car feel a bit jittery over broken surfaces. It’s still a very comfortable way to travel, but a Volvo XC40 Recharge is slightly more relaxing. One thing against the EQB is that it’s quite pricey. But if you want the best price, check out the latest Mercedes EQB deals on Carwow, or browse used EQB models from our network of trusted dealers. You can also take a look at other used Mercedes, and when it's time to sell your car, Carwow can help with that, too.",,Carwow
mercedes,general,"Is the Mercedes EQC a good car? Few things move as quickly as an electric car, apart from electric car technology. Revealed in 2019, the Mercedes EQC was the automaker’s first all-electric EQ vehicle, based on the GLC SUV, it wowed with its silent and effortless performance, smooth ride, and impressive tech. Five years on and the electric SUV segment is burgeoning with impressive alternatives. Electric cars like the BMW iX, Ford Mustang Mach-e, and Tesla Model Y all offer a similarly silky driving experience, but the EQC still remains a solid choice. Unlike the overtly futuristic designs of some alternatives, the EQC looks very much like the rest of Mercedes’ SUV offerings, especially since most of the range now shares its narrow headlight design and curvy detailing around the windows and roofline. Mercedes EQC: electric range, battery and charging data Range: 245-254 milesEfficiency: 2.7-2.8 miles per kWhBattery size: 80kWhMax charge speed: 110kWCharge time AC: 7hr 30mins, 10-100% at 11kWCharge time DC: 40 mins, 10-80% at 110kWCharge port location: Right side rearPower outputs: 402hp The interior will also be familiar to Mercedes owners, with two wide digital screens taking centre stage and a row of physical buttons placed below them. The rectangular air vents are the only obvious departure from the norm. The infotainment system is intuitive, with most major functions accessible without having to scroll through endless sub-menus. Interacting with the system can be done either through the central touchscreen, via the centre console touchpad, or the ‘Hey Mercedes’ voice feature. The voice recognition software responds to select commands and allows you to change things like the interior temperature or radio station without taking your hands off the steering wheel. Even though it is packed with features, the infotainment system is one area where the EQC is starting to show its age a bit. The latest iDrive system in the BMW iX, as well as some newer Mercedes models feature slicker setups with even larger screens. The Mercedes EQC is a decent all-rounder, but newer alternatives have faster charging and slicker infotainment Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer One aspect of the EQC that never gets old is its spacious interior. Four adults will have no trouble getting and staying comfortable on long trips, and the ride quality is also impressive over pockmarked surfaces. The silent EV powertrain and vault-like build quality of the EQC make it a consummate motorway cruiser, with little wind and tyre noise making its way into the cabin. The advanced all-wheel drive system can apportion power between the two axles depending on the traction available. The driver assistance systems aren’t quite as advanced as some newer offerings, but the EQC can still drive along the motorway, braking, accelerating, and steering for you as long as you don’t remove your hands from the steering wheel. The official range between charges is 255 miles, on par with the base BMW iX, but a bit behind the Jaguar I-Pace and Tesla Model Y. Its maximum charge rate of 110kW is falling a bit behind too – it takes about 40 minutes to go from 10-100% at a public charger, but that number would be closer to 30 minutes in newer alternatives. All things considered, this remains a solid choice among electric SUVs, so if you want the best price check out Carwow’s Mercedes EQC deals or browse used EQCs from our network of trusted dealers. You can also see other used Mercedes stock, and when it’s time to sell your car, Carwow can help with that too.",,Carwow
mercedes,general,"Is the Mercedes EQE a good car? This is the latest in a growing line of electric saloons, the Mercedes EQE. It’s a car to consider if you’ve shopped around for a Porsche Taycan or Audi e-tron GT. If the Mercedes EQS is Dr Evil of Austin Powers fame, the Mercedes EQE is like Mini-Me. It’s a near-identical clone of the big luxury car, albeit cut down to a smaller scale. It’s perhaps to a fault just how similar the EQE is to its larger counterpart. It’s remarkably close upfront, with near-identical headlights and bumper. Even down the side, it has the same not-quite-coupe, not-quite-traditional-saloon silhouette. As standard, you’ll be able to have the Mercedes EQE AMG-Line with 19-inch alloy wheels. Higher-spec AMG Line Premium and Premium Plus will get 20- and 21-inch units, while Exclusive Luxury trim gets a more subtle 21-inch design. The shrunken EQS theme continues to the back with its LED lightbar, gloss black diffuser and slight spoiler on the boot. It’s not exactly an exciting looking car, and being so close to the EQS doesn’t do it many favours, but it’s certainly not offensive. Hop inside the Mercedes EQE and you’re met with fake leather upholstery. Go for a Luxury car though and you will get Nappa leather. Dominating the dashboard of some continental EQE cars is the huge Hyperscreen infotainment system, though this is not yet confirmed to be coming to the UK. You’ll need to make do with a smaller system, but more on that shortly. Mercedes EQE 300 AMG-Line cars that will be coming to the UK will get subtly pinstriped wood inserts on the dashboard, though it also gets ambient lighting surrounding the dashboard for a bit of a classier feel. As for the screens, there’s a 12.3-inch digital driver’s display while the central system measures at 12.8-inches and contains Mercedes’ fantastic MBUX infotainment tech. This is super responsive and has the rare inclusion of a genuinely decent voice assistant in a car. If you’d prefer to mirror your phone, both Android Auto and Apple CarPlay are supported, too. If you want the ultimate tech package, go for the AMG Line Premium Plus. This gets cool stuff like a Burmester surround sound system and even lights that can project directions onto the road Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer You’ll be able to seat three in the back of the Mercedes EQE, though you might want to keep this to two adults at most. The backrests are tilted quite high and because the seats have been mounted low, there’s not a whole lot of space to stretch your feet out. Headroom in the back isn’t all that generous either. It’ll be fine for kids for sure, but taller adults might find it quite tight — especially with the sunroof blind closed. As for boot space, the Mercedes EQE gets 430 litres. That’s a touch better than the Porsche Taycan’s 407 litres and Audi e-tron GT’s 405 litres. However, both of those cars have extra storage under the bonnet — which the EQE doesn’t offer. In the UK, you can currently only order the Mercedes EQE in 300 guise, or in expensive AMG EQE 53 form. The 300 comes equipped with a single motor producing 245hp, with a claimed 0-60mph time of 7.3 seconds. The AMG 53 model gets two motors, four-wheel drive, and 625hp. Other markets will get the 408hp Mercedes EQE 500, but no word on if or when that will be coming to these shores. Both versions use the same 90kWh battery, though. In the EQE 300, this is claimed to return as much as 384 miles. Realistically though, that figure will likely be closer to the 300-mile mark in real-world driving. The AMG version manages a claimed 290 miles between charges. Where the Mercedes EQE best excels is out on the motorway. Its super-supple air suspension makes light work of bumps, and its cosy front seats are a great place to chew miles up. It’s not going to be the last word in fun, though, coming in quite heavy and wafty. If you’re wanting a more involved drive, the Porsche Taycan will be the way to go. Ultimately, the Mercedes EQE is a car to consider if you’re looking for a tech-filled electric way to chew miles up and down the country. Just don’t expect it to turn that many heads. If you want to get a Mercedes EQE, you can through carwow, as well as other Mercedes models. You can lease a Mercedes through carwow as well, while you can get used Mercedes models here too. To help you change your car altogether, you can sell your car, where you can get carwow's trusted dealers to get you the best price for your car.",,Carwow
mercedes,general,"Is the Mercedes EQE SUV a good car? The Mercedes EQE SUV runs in the same vein as the EQE saloon by being the mid-size option for Mercedes – this time in the SUV segment. The all-electric model has been produced in a similar vein to the EQS and EQS SUV by being the built-up version of the electric saloon, and carries similar styling. It looks a lot like Mercedes has put the EQS SUV through a photocopier and set it to 80%. If you weren’t told which one was which from a picture, you wouldn’t be able to tell the difference. The face of the EQE SUV has a large black faux grille with lots of three-pointed stars inside it, while there are large inlets around the bottom edge. Along the side, it’s a pretty standard SUV shape, while the back of the car has a light bar connecting the rear brake lights. The roofline is designed with aerodynamics in mind – as the EQE and EQS-derived vehicles look a lot like a smoothed pebble or Apple Magic Mouse. In the cabin, you’ll find wood trim and black leather upholstery as standard alongside piano black in the middle and metallic detailing around the edges and vents. You also get a central touchscreen and a digital driver’s display behind the steering wheel, while ambient lighting adds colour to the darker areas of the cabin. If the EQE and EQS SUV are anything to go by, the EQE SUV should have loads of space in the cabin, with the flat floor allowing for lots of foot and legroom, while headroom should also be excellent. The boot is 520 litres, which isn’t spectacular, but it’s more than a BMW iX – likely to be a close alternative. The Audi Q8 e-tron has a 569-litre space though, while a Jaguar I-Pace has a 577-litre boot. You get two battery options with the EQE SUV, both coming with 4Matic all-wheel drive and each with a different motor. The 350 ‘entry’ version gets an 89kWh battery, while the 500 is fitted with a 91kWh pack – so there’s little difference there. Where the 500 steps ahead of the 350 is its power output. The lower-powered 350 has 288hp and 765Nm of torque, while the 500 develops 402hp and 858Nm, meaning more performance but less range. The EQE SUV comes with similar features to its bigger EQS sibling, but it’s expensive and doesn’t stand out very much Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer With the smaller battery yet less powerful motor setup, you can get up to 334 miles, while the 500 gets up to 324 miles despite the larger battery pack. For charging, both can be charged on AC at 22kW, while DC charging rates are capped at 170kW – still quick enough to charge the batteries from 10-80% in around 30 minutes. If the EQS SUV and EQE are anything to go by, the EQE SUV should be quiet, comfortable and easy to drive around. The town aspect could be tricky though, as the EQE SUV has a 12.3m turning circle that larger cars, like the Range Rover, can easily beat. The top two trims do get 10-degree rear-axle steering to help that though. As standard there’s a reversing camera, but only the entry model doesn’t get all-around cameras, making urban life slightly simpler. With air suspension as standard, long-distance comfort should be excellent. All but the entry model get adaptive cruise control and blind spot monitoring alongside other key safety systems, so the base AMG Line – although the most affordable – may be the one trim to avoid. Weighing north of 2,500kg, the EQE SUV probably won’t be the most dynamic car to drive. Sure you’ll have plenty of punch from the motors and the air suspension should deal with most of the lean that you’ll get going through sharper bends, but we don’t expect it to be a sporty SUV. Leave that to the likes of the BMW iX M60 or Porsche Cayenne Turbo GT if you still want some petrol power in your life. One major drawback of the EQE SUV is the price. Starting from £90,560, it certainly isn’t cheap and it is severely undercut by the BMW iX and Audi Q8 e-tron – similarly-sized alternatives that offer a comparative finish and feel. Once we’ve driven the EQE SUV, we’ll update this with our full impressions. But in the meantime, check out deals on Mercedes models on carwow, where you can also buy used Mercedes models that could be more your style.

mercedes,general,"Is the Mercedes EQS a good car? The Mercedes EQS is, as that last little letter suggests, the electric equivalent of the mighty S-Class luxury saloon. Styled to look like a worn-smooth bar of soap, the EQS slips through the air to score a lengthy claimed range number. It’s like wrapping one of those Olympic swimming suits around a big battery pack. It’s a more distinctive looking car than the S-Class, which remains a traditional, upright saloon car. The EQS’ roof seems to run in one single huge curved line from the front wheels to the rear ones, and it’s almost a mono-box shape, like someone squashed a Ford Transit. It’s a much more practical car than the smaller EQE saloon too. The two cars share a lot of battery and motor technology, but the EQS is actually a massive hatchback, with a fastback boot lid that opens up to reveal lots of cargo space. Is it gorgeous? Not quite, but it’s kind of cool in a science-nerdy way. If you want it to look a bit more traditional, you can optionally have the EQS with the old-school stand-up Mercedes badge on the edge of the bonnet. The EQS’ sheer size — it’s a really big car — means that you get a huge range. In fact the bigger-battery 450+ model can go for a claimed 481 miles on a full charge, while even the basic (not that any EQS is exactly basic) 350 version can manage a claimed 409 mile range. Watch: BMW i7 v Mercedes EQS range test Having a big range means also having a big battery, and the EQS certainly has one of those, with a 450+ model stretching to 118kWh of stored energy. Don’t worry, though; the battery also charges up quickly, at up to 200kW of DC power (the smaller battery charges at 170kW), so you should be back on the road fairly soon. In fact, you can — in theory — add as much as 186 miles of extra range in just 15 minutes’ charging, if the charger and the battery are both in their happy places. There’s 22kW AC charging for when you have more time, but charging at home on a 7.4kW wallbox can take a staggering 17 hours (!) from empty to full. Mercedes EQS: electric range, battery and charging data Range: 377-481 milesEfficiency: 3.3-3.6 miles per kWhBattery size: 96-118kWhMax charge speed: 170-200kWCharge time AC: 13-17hrsCharge time DC: 31-32minsCharge port location: Right rearPower outputs: 292-360bhp Inside, as standard you now get the massive ‘Hyperscreen’ dashboard, which packages three separate screens under one massive glass cover that seems to be the size of a snooker table. There’s an instrument display for the driver, a big main infotainment screen, and a smaller passenger-side screen, just in case whoever’s in that seat doesn’t fancy holding their phone. As you’d expect from a Mercedes with an S badge, there’s tremendous quality in the cabin, with lots of shiny metal, carefully polished wood, and soft leather. The built-in pillows on the headrests are positively decadent. It’s not all good, though — probe around the edges and you will find some cheap materials that have no place in a car this expensive. Performance is brisk, but nothing spectacular. Both the EQS 350 and the 450+ will crack the 0-62mph run in under seven seconds, but the 2,600-2,700kg kerb weight clearly takes a toll on that. Better to just sit back and cruise and extend that range as far as you can. The EQS 450+ offers all the range you could ever need Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer There’s tremendous comfort, with standard Airmatic air suspension, and there’s even a camera in the windscreen that can spot bumps coming up in the road ahead, and warn the suspension so that it can react with more grace. Better still, that system can even remember where the bumps are for later. That’s not all, as you also get rear wheel steering for a tighter turning circle. For all the comfort, though, the EQS isn’t brilliant to drive. It’s very soft and squashy on its suspension, and can feel a bit like a luxurious canal barge at times. The ultra-soft brake pedal doesn’t inspire much in the way of confidence, particularly in town. The EQS is also very, very expensive with even the cheapest version coming in a few quid short of six figures. Still, if you like the idea of a silent, super luxurious electric limousine that’s jam-packed with impressive technology, then you’ll love the Mercedes EQS.

mercedes,general,"Is the Mercedes EQS SUV a good car? If you’re in the market for a premium electric SUV, you need to be looking at the Mercedes EQS SUV. You’re spoilt for choice in its segment, as the Mercedes goes up against the BMW iX, Tesla Model X and Volvo EX90 that definitely grab the attention. It’s like choosing a classy Chanel handbag, instead of one from Louis Vuitton, Gucci or Prada – it’s all down to what style you prefer and suits you best. Taking the styling cues from the EQS saloon, the SUV is effectively a jacked-up version of the high-end cruiser. You have the same large solid ‘grille’ with the Mercedes star and mini logos in the design, but it’s all a bit taller and more imposing. It also comes with a high roofline that gets lots of glass to help brighten up the cabin, while you get a full-width lightbar across the back – which doesn’t have the most exciting look, much like the other bespoke Mercedes EVs. Mercedes always does a stylish job with its cabins, so the EQS SUV is pretty swish inside. Large screens, shiny trim pieces and high quality materials are the name of the game here, and that makes for a lovely experience. There are some scratchy plastics on the stalks though, which are quite a let-down in a car at this price point. Space-wise, you have plenty. The front seats have lots of adjustment, while the rear offers lots of head and legroom. There’s a flat floor for your feet to slide under the front seats and you could easily get three in the back, although headroom at either side may be limited by the roof cutting in sharply. Practicality is good with the EQS SUV. The 880-litre boot with five seats is considerably better than a BMW iX’s 500 litres, but it’s outclassed compared to the Tesla Model X and Volvo EX90 in five- and seven-seat layouts though. No luxury electric SUV comes close to the EQS SUV. It’s comfy, quiet and very nice to drive Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Take the EQS SUV out for a drive and you’ll find that the premium fit and finish is just as obvious on the road. The standard air suspension helps soak up most bumps – unless they’re really sharp ones at slow speed – and that allows for smooth, almost unrivalled comfort in town. The electric motors give you plenty of performance out of junctions and away from lights, while the steering isn’t heavy at all. You get rear-wheel steering as standard to help with manoeuvring and 360-degree cameras and parking sensors as well, so you shouldn’t be bumping into things. But even without the cameras, visibility is great – although the A-pillar is quite chunky. Out of town and you could easily do a lot of miles in the EQS SUV. The standard-fit seats are superbly comfortable – although only top-spec Business Class models get massage seats. As standard, you get the full suite of safety systems available, including blind spot monitoring, adaptive cruise control, lane keep assist and emergency braking assist. The EQS SUV isn’t really made for dynamic driving, but with sport mode engaged, body control on a twisty section of road is very good without disrupting ride comfort too much. You wouldn’t class it as exciting though. If you like the look of the Mercedes EQS SUV, get the latest prices and deals on one through carwow as well as other Mercedes models.

mercedes,general,"Is the Mercedes-AMG GT Coupe a good car? This is the Mercedes-AMG GT Coupe, a supercar with gorgeous styling and a raucous V8 engine under the bonnet. It’s a bit like Rocky in the sequels, because it has come back bigger and better than before. And it needed to, because the old model was never quite up there with the very best alternatives, such as the Porsche 911 and Ferrari Roma, and now also has to fight with the updated Aston Martin Vantage for your cash. Something the AMG GT has never had an issue with is its design. It’s absolutely drop-dead gorgeous, and that sleek side profile with the massive bonnet looks just as classy as it always has. There are quirky lights at the rear and an aggressive front bumper design, but it is a touch disappointing there’s some vent and exhaust fakery going on. It’s similarly lovely inside, from the exquisite stitching to the turbine-style vents that glow red when you turn the temperature up. You get soft upholstery on the top of the door so you have somewhere comfortable to rest your arm, and the steering wheel is wrapped in comfortable Alcantara. The seats are really comfortable and you can get nice and low for a properly sporty feeling. It’s not perfect, because the start/stop button is positioned awkwardly behind the infotainment display and there are a few cheap buttons here and there, such as the gear selector and sun visors. Watch: Audi R8 v Mercedes-AMG GT v Porsche 911 drag race Practicality is decent by supercar standards. At 321 litres the boot is bigger than you get in a Porsche 911, though the rear seats are so cramped they’re almost pointless. Also the door bins and glovebox are pretty small, but there is a useful space inside the armrest and a couple of cupholders beneath the infotainment display. Speaking of which, this display is big, clear and responds quickly to your inputs. It’s a shame the climate controls are on the screen rather than physical buttons, but they are at least always on display, whatever menu you’re in. You also get a digital instrument display, but it’s not very neatly integrated into the dashboard and some of the graphics are needlessly complicated. You probably won’t care once you’re out on the road though, because the Mercedes-AMG GT Coupe is fantastic to drive. Beneath that long bonnet is a big V8 that barks and crackles its glorious soundtrack. In 63 guise it makes 585hp, while the 63 S adds an electric motor that boosts power drastically to 816hp. The 63 we tested feels quick enough on the road, and with all-wheel drive as standard it does a great job of putting its power into the Tarmac, something the old GT struggled with. As a result, you can make swift, confident progress even on damp, broken British roads. The AMG GT is so capable and easy to drive down a twisty road, the 911 is a fantastic all-rounder, and the Vantage feels more special inside – it’s tricky choosing between them! Mat Watson Expert Car Reviewer Perhaps more impressive for a supercar is just how easy to the AMG GT is to drive normally. The steering isn’t light but it’s not cumbersome, visibility is great all round, and while the suspension is sporty enough to make the car feel alert and alive, at lower speeds it takes the edge of bumps nicely so you don’t have to sacrifice too much comfort. Choosing between this, the Porsche 911 and Aston Martin Vantage is really difficult – the Porsche is a brilliant all-rounder, the Vantage feels a bit more special inside, and the AMG GT is so confidence-inspiring it feels like you could drive it down your favourite country road quicker than the other two. One potential downside is the price. The ‘63’ AMG GT starts at around £165,000 – similar to alternatives – but the hybrid 63 S goes up to £190,000 before options, which is £10,000 more than the full fat 911 Turbo S.
