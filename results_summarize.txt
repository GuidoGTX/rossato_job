The information provided appears to be about an electric vehicle (EV) called the MG4. Here are some key points extracted from the text:

**Performance**

* The MG4 comes in three power outputs: 170hp, 204hp, or 245hp.
* It's comfortable and surprisingly nimble in bends, but there's a bit of wind noise on the motorway.
* The light steering is less welcome at high speeds, but you can increase the weight a bit in the settings.

**Space and Practicality**

* There's decent space for passengers, with adjustable seats and ample headroom for tall individuals.
* However, rear seat space is limited, especially with three adults.
* The boot capacity is not terrible (363 liters), but it lags behind other EVs like the ID3 or Leaf.

**Charging**

* Charging speeds vary depending on the battery size:
	+ Small battery: 10 to 80% in 39 minutes at up to 117kW, or in 35 minutes at 135kW.
	+ Large battery: 39 minutes at up to 150kW.

**Tax and Reliability**

* The MG4 is subject to the minimum tax for electric vehicles.
* MG came dead last in reliability issues among EVs in some reviews. However, MG provides an excellent seven-year80,000-mile warranty that's fully transferable.

**Other Features**

* All MG4 models come with automatic LED headlights, tinted windows, and a leather steering wheel as standard (except for the lowest trim level).
* The highest trim level includes additional features like adaptive cruise control, door opening warning, blind spot detection, rear cross traffic alert, and lane change assist.
* Unfortunately, the infotainment system can be tricky to use due to laggy responses and too many menus.

Please note that some information might not be applicable or up-to-date as this appears to be a review of an electric vehicle from 2022.

The provided text is a review of the Volkswagen ID.3 electric vehicle from Carwow, covering various aspects such as design, features, performance, space, and more. The key points from the review are:

* The ID.3 has a unique design with a tall silhouette, but it's not particularly exciting to drive.
* The interior feels very open and spacious due to the large windscreen and extra windows in the pillars.
* The infotainment system is improved in the 2023 update, with a new huge 12.9-inch touchscreen display that has permanent shortcut bars at the top and bottom for easier access to functions like climate controls or driving modes.
* There are four battery and motor combinations available: basic Pure models get a 52kWh battery and 170hp motor, good for around 240 miles; Pro cars get a 58kWh battery and 204hp motor with a range boost up to around 270 miles; Pro S cars get the same motor but a much larger 77kWh battery with a range leap up to 345 miles; and the rangetopping GTX gets the most performance, with 326hp on tap.
* The ID.3 is a fully electric car, so it remains a smart choice for company car buyers thanks to low road tax.

The text also mentions various features and specifications of the vehicle, such as its ability to charge at up to 120kW or 170kW for Pro S models, with claimed range figures from around 240 miles to over 300 miles depending on driving style. The ID.3's boot is a good size (385 liters) with a square shape and has hooks for hanging bags off. However, there are some limitations in terms of interior color options, infotainment system ease of use while driving, and some minor issues with the vehicle's past reliability.

I'll summarize the content of the article about the Fiat 500e.

**Design**

The Fiat 500e has a new design language that is more rounded and minimalist compared to the previous model. It features two semicircular lamps, curved daytime running lights, flush door handles, and hidden indicators on the rear. The interior is digital with a brand-new 7.0-inch display instead of traditional dials.

**Features**

The Fiat 500e comes in two battery options: one offering a 115-mile range and another with a 199-mile range. It can be charged using a three-pin socket or wallbox charging via AC up to 11kW or 7.4 kW. The fastest way is public fast charger charging with speeds of up to 85 kW, capable of taking up to 30 miles in just five minutes and zero to full from empty in 35 minutes.

**Performance**

The Fiat 500e's motor provides enough power for acceleration and overtaking times have been improved over the previous petrol model. The car is suitable for driving around towns but may be a bit noisy on dual carriageways and motorways due to wind and tyre noise. Automated cruise control, adaptive cruise control, lanekeeping technology, autosteer are available.

**Space**

The Fiat 500e has limited rear seat space with cramped conditions making it unsuitable for adults behind the front seats. There is a foldable cup holder between the front seats but not enough room for belongings or phone charging facilities in the rear. The boot capacity of the Fiat 500e is around 185 liters.

**Infotainment**

The Fiat 500e features a high-definition rear camera, smartphone mirroring via wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity. There are also details about the battery's state of charge and power available displayed on the infotainment system.

**Tax**

Being an electric car, there are no CO2 emissions, so it qualifies for a zero percent VED rate. Company car tax rates are lower than petrol or diesel-powered vehicles, making it cheaper to buy a company vehicle.

**Rating**

The Fiat 500e has been reviewed as having good performance and drive comfort despite some issues with noise on motorways and less comfortable driving experience compared to other small city cars like the Mini Electric. The overall rating is around 7 out of 10.

There's no specific question being asked here, it seems like you're providing information about an article or product review on Fiat cars. I'll do my best to summarize key points and answer any questions you may have.

Here are some key points from the text:

* The Fiat 600e is a compact electric SUV with decent interior space.
* It's available in two trim levels: Red and La Prima, with more features and options available in the higher-end model.
* Performance-wise, it's got good efficiency but a slightly larger footprint means it might not be as fun to drive on twisty roads.
* Safety features are limited in the base model, but upgrading to La Prima adds some useful features like blind spot detection and adaptive cruise control.
* Reliability is an issue with Fiat cars, especially with their petrol-powered models, but it's unclear how this applies to electric variants.

Please feel free to ask any specific questions you might have about this text or the Fiat 600e.

The provided text is a review of the Renault Arkana vehicle, covering its features, performance, and other details.

Here are some key points mentioned in the review:

* The Arkana has a decent-sized boot (480 liters) with plenty of room for luggage or cargo.
* It comes with standard equipment like wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, cruise control, and autonomous emergency braking.
* The top-spec Esprit Alpine model gets additional features such as adaptive cruise control, heated seats and steering wheel, electric seats, and rear privacy glass.
* The review notes that the Arkana is not particularly practical for carrying people in the back due to limited headroom and knee room.
* It criticizes the lack of clever boot features like hooks or a 12-volt socket.
* The interior cabin is well-made with plush materials, but not particularly stylish compared to other alternatives on the market.

The review also discusses performance, highlighting that:

* The Arkana can be quite firm over uneven roads and has some engine noise through the cabin.
* It's best suited for motorway driving due to its comfort and reduced noise levels.
* Adaptive cruise control is only available on the top-spec model.

Overall, the review concludes that the Renault Arkana offers good value for money but may not be the most practical SUV in terms of interior space.

This is a detailed review summary of the Citroen C3 Origin car model. Here are some key points:

**Design and Features**

* The Citroen C3 Origin has a stylish exterior with plenty of personalization options.
* The interior features leather-looking straps to close the door, and some models come with wood-effect trim on the dashboard.

**Space and Practicality**

* The car has decent space in the front seats, with good adjustment for the driver's seat and steering wheel height.
* However, rear seat room is tight, especially with the optional panoramic glass roof, making it difficult to find comfortable positions for passengers.
* There are decentsized door bins in the back, but that's about it, and there are no USB sockets to charge devices.

**Performance**

* The best engine choice is the 110hp 1.2-litre petrol, offering a good balance of performance and economy.
* The diesel engine is only worth considering if you spend most time on the motorway and need improved fuel economy for company car tax purposes.

**MPG, Emissions, and Tax**

* The Citroen C3 Origin is available with two petrol engines (83hp and 110hp) and one diesel engine (102hp).
* The lower-powered petrol is only available with a manual gearbox.
* The diesel engine returns the best fuel economy at 71mpg.

**Safety and Security**

* The car scored four out of five stars in its 2017 Euro NCAP safety rating.
* Lane departure warning, cruise control, and reversing camera come as standard on midspec cars upwards.
* Front collision warning and auto high beams are only available on topspec cars.

The provided text appears to be a review or analysis of the Citroen eC4, an electric car model. The information is organized into several sections:

**Introduction**

* The eC4 is the electric version of the Citroen C4.
* It has a unique design blend of hatchback, coupe, and SUV features with compact dimensions.
* The eC4 comes in three trim levels: You, Plus, and Max.

**Performance and Drive Comfort**

* The eC4 is easy to drive around town due to its smooth acceleration and instant response from a standstill.
* However, the steering is too light and distant for the driver's enjoyment.
* The extra weight of the eC4 shows through in bends with duller responses and lack of dynamism.

**Space and Practicality**

* The front seats are comfortable, but rear seats may be a bit cramped due to headroom limitations.
* There's plenty of storage space in the front, including a double-floored storage space under the centre console.
* However, the glovebox is somewhat small.

**Interior Style, Infotainment, and Accessories**

* The eC4's interior is well-built but feels old-fashioned in some places.
* It comes with plenty of physical buttons rather than forcing everything through a touchscreen.
* There are screens, including a 10.0-inch infotainment touchscreen on all models.

**Electric Range, Charging, and Tax**

* The eC4 has two motor and battery options: a 50kWh setup (up to 218 miles) paired with a 136hp electric motor or a newer 54kWh setup (up to 256 miles) with a more efficient electric motor.
* Both batteries have good charging rates, but the bigger battery is recommended for non-town driving.

**Safety Security**

* The eC4 has safety equipment such as autonomous emergency braking, lane-keeping aids, and driver attention alerts on all models. Max models get additional features including semi-autonomous drive capabilities.

The text also mentions that Citroen was named one of the best brands to own in terms of owner satisfaction by the Driver Power survey for 2024.

The provided text appears to be a car review for the Citroen e-Berlingo, discussing its features, performance, and other aspects. However, I'll highlight some key points:

**Key Points**

* The e-Berlingo is a practical electric van that's great for urban and intra-urban commuting.
* It comes in two sizes (M and XL) with seven seats and offers plenty of space inside.
* Its cabin features are based on vanspec plastics, but they're rugged and comfy.
* It charges at up to 100kW from a DC public fast charger and can be charged from flat in about eight hours when using a home wallbox.
* The e-Berlingo has various safety features as standard, including stability control, ABS brakes, front, side, and rear curtain airbags.

**Additional Points**

* The text also mentions that the e-Berlingo's electric motor is tuned for urban driving but struggles with range on long journeys.
* There are concerns about towing anything in an e-Berlingo due to limited battery range.
* Various models of the Citroen Berlingo are compared, including the Peugeot eRifter and Vauxhall Combo Life Electric.

It seems like you've copied the content from Carwow's website about the Citroen C5 X. However, I can provide you with a summary of the key points based on that content.

**Overview**

The Citroen C5 X is a car that offers a bit of everything, making it a unique offering in its class. It combines elements of an SUV, estate, and hatchback to create a distinctive vehicle.

**Features and Performance**

* The C5 X has three engine options: a 1.2-liter petrol engine (130hp), a 1.6-liter petrol engine (180hp), and a plug-in hybrid model with a 225hp electric motor.
* The plugin hybrid model offers up to 34 miles of electric-only range, but this is reduced to around 20 miles in real-world conditions.
* The car has an automatic eight-speed transmission and features adaptive cruise control as standard on the top-of-the-line model.

**Interior and Comfort**

* The interior design is universally appealing, with a choice of materials including wood-effect trim inserts and soft-touch plastics to plush-feeling leather and fabric upholsteries depending on which model you opt for.
* The car has comfortable seats with layers of different foams to provide better support, and there are multiple adjustments available to help get the driving position comfortable.
* There is also plenty of room in the cabin for all passengers to get comfy.

**Tax and Emissions**

* The plugin hybrid model offers a lower tax rate due to its lower emissions, but this is not the most competitive tax rate available.
* The car has an official electriconly range of up to 34 miles, but real-world conditions reduce this to around 20 miles.

**Reliability and Problems**

* The C5 X is too new to be featured in any reliability surveys or tests at this point in time.
* Citroen offers a three-year warranty as standard on all its cars, including the C5 X.

Overall, the Citroen C5 X seems to offer a unique blend of features and performance that could make it an attractive option for some buyers. However, there are also potential drawbacks to consider, such as the car's high price and limited tax benefits for private buyers.

Here's a summary of the provided text:

The text is about the Citroen Berlingo car model. Here are some key points:

**Design and Features**

* The Berlingo has a boxy design, which makes it easy to drive in town with its large windows giving good visibility.
* It comes with various features such as reversing camera (standard on higher models), lane keeping assist, cruise control, and Apple CarPlay/Android Auto connectivity.

**Performance and Drive Comfort**

* The Berlingo is relatively easy to drive despite its size.
* Low-speed driving is stress-free due to light steering.
* However, the car can feel a bit cumbersome at low speeds.

**Space and Practicality**

* The Berlingo has ample boot space (1,255 liters), although it's a fixed divider between passengers and cargo which may not be ideal for ultimate usability.
* Rear legroom is limited compared to other cars in its class.

**Interior Style and Infotainment**

* The interior is fairly basic with no soft-touch plastics but everything feels robust and there's enough tech on board for most people.
* The Flair XTR model adds some color with a green dashboard and seat details.

**Engine Options**

* There are three engine options: 1.2-liter petrol (110hp), two diesel variants (101hp and 130hp).

**MPG, Emissions, and Tax**

* MPG varies depending on the engine chosen:
	+ The 1.2-liter petrol engine returns around 37mpg.
	+ The 101hp 1.5-liter diesel returns up to 54mpg.
	+ Company car buyers might prefer the allelectric EBerlingo for lower benefit-in-kind tax.

**Safety and Security**

* The Berlingo has a four-star safety rating from its 2018 test, with some deductions made in the pedestrian protection category due to its brick-like shape.

I will provide the main points from the text about the BMW X4:

1. Price: The price of the BMW X4 is 72.959.

2. Condition: The car is in good condition, with high-quality materials used throughout its interior.

3. Engine options: There are two diesel engine options for the standard X4 model (a more powerful six-cylinder diesel) and three engine options for the M model (straight-six petrol and straight-six diesel, with an optional fourth option being a 510hp X4 M).

4. Drive system: All models come with BMW's xDrive four-wheel drive as standard.

5. Fuel economy: The fuel economy is relatively good for this type of car, with the best option being the ability to do 49mpg in the 2.0litre diesel engine model (20d) which gives reasonably punchy performance, decent fuel economy and lowish CO2 emissions.

6. Safety features: The BMW X4 has a comprehensive set of safety features including automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning, rear cross traffic alert and adaptive LED headlights that illuminate as much as possible without dazzling oncoming drivers.

7. Reliability and problems: BMW cars are generally very reliable and well-made, but they can be complex so small niggles can sometimes occur.

8. Features: The BMW X4 has a high-tech interior with old-fashioned separate instrument displays under a binnacle behind the steering wheel.

This is a detailed review of the BMW iX3 from Carwow UK. Here's a summary:

**Design and Features**

* The BMW iX3 has a unique design with a sealed front grille to reduce drag and improve range.
* It features 20-inch wheels that help smooth airflow, but are vulnerable to kerbing.
* The interior is similar to the standard X3, with a comfortable cabin and high-quality infotainment system.
* However, the iX3's infotainment system is not as good as some other options on the market.

**Performance**

* The iX3 is quick, with a 0-60mph time of 6.8 seconds.
* It's more than enough for UK drivers, but it doesn't quite live up to its full potential in Sport mode.
* The iX3 has good handling and grip, thanks to the floor-mounted battery pack.

**Space and Practicality**

* The iX3 has plenty of space for people, with well-designed seats that allow knees, feet, and heads to fit comfortably.
* The boot is slightly smaller than a standard X3's, but it still holds 1,560 liters when loaded to the roof.
* There are useful storage areas at each side with nets for holding delicate items.

**Charging and Efficiency**

* The iX3 has an 80kWh gross battery capacity, with actual useable capacity of 74kWh.
* It achieves a respectable efficiency figure of 3.6 miles per kWh during testing.
* The iX3 can add 237 miles of range in as little as 30 minutes using a 150kW charger.

**Safety and Security**

* The iX3 comes with active radar-guided cruise control, speed limit assistant, and other safety features as standard.
* It also has an impressive score for adult occupant protection (93) and child occupants (84).

**Reliability and Problems**

* BMWs are not always as reliable as you might expect, but the iX3 has fewer moving parts than a traditional car engine.
* All BMW i-badged electric models come with a three-year, unlimited-mileage warranty.

Overall, this review provides a detailed look at the features, performance, and reliability of the BMW iX3. It's clear that Carwow UK is impressed with the iX3's capabilities, but also notes some areas where it could improve.
The information provided is an article review of the BMW X7 car model.

Here are some key points mentioned in the text:

**Design and Features**

* The X7 has a unique design that may not appeal to everyone.
* The interior features include a curved twin-screen display, piano black trim, leather upholstery, and metal surfaces.
* The infotainment system is controlled through a rotary dial with menu buttons on the steering wheel.

**Engine and Performance**

* There are three engine options: diesel (352hp), M60i petrol (530hp), and 40i petrol (381hp).
* The diesel engine returns reasonable fuel economy at 32.8-36.2mpg.
* The M60i engine is the best to drive on twisty roads.

**Space and Practicality**

* The X7 has ample space for passengers and cargo.
* There are seven seats as standard, but a six-seat layout can be opted for if needed.
* The third row is surprisingly spacious, and there's plenty of room for storage.

**Interior Style and Infotainment**

* The interior is stylishly made with an impressive but complicated infotainment system.
* The climate control menu is now buried in menus rather than easily accessible through buttons on the dashboard or steering wheel.

**MPG, Emissions, and Tax**

* All X7 models return high emissions, which means they'll attract a surcharge for private buyers.
* Company car drivers will also have high bills due to the high tax bracket.
* No plugin hybrid or fully electric X7 is available.

**Safety and Security**

* The X7 comes with plenty of safety kit as standard, including autonomous emergency braking.
* More driver aids can be added to the standard spec with the Technology Plus Pack.
The text appears to be a review of the BMW i5 electric vehicle. Here are some key points summarized:

**Performance:**

* The i5 is fast and comfortable, but feels heavy when cornering

Here is a summary of the information about the carwow.co.uk/BMW/M4_Competitive_ convertible review:

**General Information**

* The model is the BMW M4 Competition Convertible.
* It has a two-door, four-seat configuration and comes in six different wheel designs.

**Design Features**

* The roof is made of fabric and can be retracted in 18 seconds at speeds up to 31mph.
* The dashboard is dominated by a big digital screen that includes an instrument panel for the driver and a touchscreen infotainment system.
* Boot space is only OK, with 385 liters when the roof is up or 300 liters when it's down.

**Features**

* It comes standard with adaptive suspension and adjustable weighting for steering.
* The MDriver pack includes a training session with BMW MSport.
* Automatic four-wheel drive means that traditional British rain is no enemy to the M4 Convertible.
* Sport mode stiffens up the suspension and steering, but Comfort mode is better for the suspension.

**Specifications**

* It develops 530hp and can accelerate from 0-62mph in just 3.7 seconds.
* The top speed is limited to 155mph or 173mph with the MDriver pack.
* The six-speed automatic gearbox can feel a bit lazy at times.

**Comparison**

* Compared to other convertibles like the Porsche Boxster GTS and Ferrari models, it's more about getting the roof down on a sunny day than being an ultimate driving machine.

**Taxation**

* CO2 emissions of 231g/km put the M4 into the second-highest road tax bracket.
* BIK costs for business users start at per month.

**Other Information**

* BMW finished a reasonable 14th in the most recent Auto Express Driver Power survey.
* Some owners reported problems with their cars (21%).

The carwow review of the BMW M3 Touring is overwhelmingly positive, but there are some minor caveats to consider.

**Design and Features**

* The M3 Touring looks great as a fast estate car, even if it's not super practical for daily life.
* The "gokart" observation is spot on, you'll have fun at first but soon realize it's not all that sensible.
* There are other options in the hot estate class like the Audi RS4 Avant (no longer available), Mercedes-AMG C63 Estate, and CLA AMG 45 Shooting Brake.

**Price**

* The starting price is high, but you can check out deals on a new BMW M3 Touring now or look at used stock from our network of trusted dealers.
* You can also sell your car online through Carwow too.

**Performance and Drive Comfort**

* The ride is surprisingly comfortable around town, even with the stiffer suspension settings.
* However, tyre noise at 70mph could become annoying over long distances.
* The M3 Touring hides its weight well, with direct steering making it easy to place in a turn.
* It feels like a sports car but you can move house in (with the carbon bucket seats).

**Space and Practicality**

* The rear seats are more spacious than those in the saloon, but boot capacity is just 500 litres (20 litres more than the saloon).
* The key selling point for the M3 Touring is its extra load-lugging ability.

**Interior Style, Infotainment, and Accessories**

* The large curved screens look fantastic, but the system isn't as easy to use as that in the old car.
* Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are included as standard.
* The M Drive Professional apps are a neat addition.

**MPG, Emissions, and Tax**

* The M3 Touring has an official fuel economy figure of 27.4mpg (which is pretty respectable for a big heavy car with 530hp).
* CO2 emissions sit at up to 235g/km.
* The M3 Touring falls into one of the higher first-year tax bands.

**Safety and Security**

* There's the usual suite of driver assistance systems present and correct, such as lane departure warning, etc.
* Adaptive cruise is an optional extra that comes as part of the Technology Plus Pack.

Overall, the BMW M3 Touring seems like a fantastic performance car with plenty of features to keep owners entertained. However, some might find it less practical for daily life than others in its class (e.g., Mercedes C63 S estate).

This text appears to be a car review written in a journalistic style. The main topics discussed are:

1. Performance and drive comfort
2. Space and practicality
3. Electric range, charging, and tax
4. Safety and security
5. Reliability and problems

The text is likely from a specific review article or website called Carwow.

Key points discussed in the article include:

* The BMW iX2 has sharp styling that marks it as one of the more stylish electric SUVs on the market.
* It's not as practical as some other options due to its sloping roofline, which limits boot space and rear seat room.
* The interior is high-quality with a great touchscreen system, but some lower-cost materials may feel too cheap for users.
* The iX2 has good visibility out of the front but poor visibility from the rear, with a thick B-pillar limiting views.
* BMW's clever parking systems can help with low-speed maneuvers and reversing.
* The suspension is firm, making some road noise noticeable, but it's fine at motorway speeds.

Some key facts about the iX2 include:

* The car starts at over £63,000 for the eDrive20 model in its sole M Sport trim.
* You can spec your iX2 up to well over £80,000 if you go for the all-wheel drive iX2 30e model and add the desirable MSport pack.
* The iX2 is quite pricey compared to other similar EVs like the Kia EV6 or Audi Q4 etron Sportback.

This text likely comes from a review article on Carwow that discusses these points in more detail.

The BMW M2 is a fantastic sports car with exceptional handling and driveability. It's composed, confident, and fun to drive, even at high speeds. The M2 feels more playful and enjoyable than its larger siblings. Its lower power output and smaller footprint make it ideal for tight country roads.

**Space and Practicality**

The M2 has a bigger boot than most others you might consider (390 liters). However, rear seat space is merely average. Front seats are pretty good with decent adjustability of the seats making it easy to find a comfortable driving position.

**Interior Style, Infotainment, and Accessories**

The M2's twinscreen setup is high-tech and easy to use. The interior design isn't as special as you'd find in a Porsche but is more aligned with what you'd expect from a comfy BMW. You'll still get reminders that this is an M car, including on the thick-rimmed steering wheel.

**Engine**

The engine taken from the bigger M3 and M4 model has been reduced by about 50hp and 100Nm of torque to make less power (460hp and 550Nm torque).

**MPG, Emissions, and Tax**

Official figures suggest 27.7mpg in mixed driving, which is almost identical to the M240's numbers. It has the same CO2 emissions figure.

**Safety and Security**

Although not specifically tested for safety, regular 2 Series models scored four out of five stars from the testing agency. The M2 comes with a parking assistant with sensors front and rear, speed limiter, and non-adaptive cruise control as standard.

The text also mentions that there are no recurring problems reported by owners of the M2, but BMW has a mixed reputation for long-term reliability and its parts can be expensive if repairs are needed.
This is a comprehensive review of the BMW i4, covering various aspects such as design, performance, space and practicality, interior style, infotainment, electric range, charging and tax, safety and security, reliability and problems. Here are some key points from the review:

**Design and Performance**

* The BMW i4 is a four-door coupe with a bold design.
* It's available in three versions: eDrive35 (282hp), eDrive40 (340hp), and M50 (544hp).
* The i4 is quick, quiet, and comfortable to drive.
* The M50 model accelerates from 0-62mph in just 3.9 seconds.

**Space and Practicality**

* The i4 has a decent boot size, but it's not the roomiest in its class.
* There's enough space for three adults to sit comfortably, although taller passengers may struggle to fit in the rear due to the sloping roofline.
* The rear seats fold down to reveal a flat floor.

**Interior Style and Infotainment**

* The interior is impressive with a curved display combining the instrument and infotainment screens.
* The BMW Operating System 8 is compatible with over-the-air software updates, and it's also compatible with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.
* However, there are no separate climate control buttons any more.

**Electric Range, Charging and Tax**

* Every i4 is an electric vehicle, so there are no exhaust emissions at all.
* The entry-level eDrive35 has a 70.2kWh battery and an official range of up to 299 miles (240-250 in the real world).
* The more expensive versions have a larger battery with an official range of up to 366 miles.

**Safety and Security**

* The i4 has been tested by safety experts, but it didn't earn a perfect five-star rating.
* Every i4 comes with Driving Assistant, which uses camera and radar sensors to give the driver warnings and reduce the chance of a collision.

**Reliability and Problems**

* Electric cars are generally more reliable than internal combustion engine cars.
* BMW's reliability and owner satisfaction are middling in terms of field performance.

This is a comprehensive review of the BMW iX electric SUV from Carwow.co.uk. The article covers various aspects such as design, performance, practicality, features, range, charging, safety, security, reliability, and more. Here's a summary:

**Design**

The BMW iX has a striking exterior design that can be loved or hated. Its lines and creases on the bonnet and wheelarches are reminiscent of NASA's Space Shuttle Discovery.

**Performance**

The iX is quick off the mark to make the most of any gap in traffic, with excellent visibility making it easy to navigate tight city streets. The air suspension on xDrive50 models smooths out bumps for a comfortable drive.

**Practicality**

The iX has plenty of space for five adults, with lots of room in the back and front. There is enough headroom even for six-foot passengers, and hidden ISOFIX points can be used to secure young children. However, boot capacity is not quite generous enough at 500 liters.

**Features**

The BMW Live Cockpit Plus system dominates the dashboard with two screens that create a seamless display experience. The infotainment screen looks fantastic, as crisp and clear as a high-end TV. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are supported.

**Electric Range and Charging**

Every version of the iX is fully electric, so there are no exhaust emissions. The official figures for range vary between models, but in reality, some variations occur depending on conditions such as battery capacity, charging speed, or temperatures. It's worth noting that even though BMW has given the xDrive40 a smaller battery with a 74 kWh capacity, it gets no bigger than 108 kWh capacity in the more powerful model.

**Safety and Security**

The iX earned a five-star rating from safety experts at Euro NCAP for its protection of adult occupants (91), child occupants (87), pedestrians (73), and safety assist systems (81). Features include airbags, lane attention assistant, lane departure warning, speed limit recognition, and autonomous emergency braking.

**Reliability**

It's still too early to make a definitive verdict on the BMW iX reliability. With fewer moving parts, electric vehicles are generally more reliable than cars with an internal combustion engine. However, that leaves plenty of hightech systems and gadgetry which could go wrong.

Overall, the BMW iX is considered one of the best electric SUVs to drive. Its performance, comfort, and features make it a luxury vehicle worth considering for those who can afford it.

This is a review article about the BMW M8 car. The text provides details and analysis of various aspects such as performance, design, features, and practicality.

Here are some key points from the review:

* The BMW M8 is a high-performance sports car with impressive stats and a refined drive.
* It's a big, heavy car that can feel intimidating when driven in urban areas.
* The M8 has an automatic transmission system that's one of the best around, but it can be a bit too much for road driving.
* The review notes that the M8 is not as practical as other options like the Audi RS7 Sportback due to its limited space and boot capacity.
* The interior is gorgeous with a top-notch infotainment system, although some features are still cost options.
* The review mentions various technical details such as the unique MDifferential system and the option for carbon-ceramic brakes.

Some key points about the M8's engine and performance include:

* It has a powerful 4.4-liter twinturbocharged V8 petrol engine that produces 600hp in standard trim and a whopping 625hp in range-topping M8 Competition guise.
* The review notes that while it can be intimidating to drive in urban areas, the M8 is a seriously impressive car to drive on the track or for long runs.

Some negative points about the M8 mentioned in the review include:

* Its price and performance stats make it not as appealing compared to other high-performance cars like the Porsche 911 Turbo.
* The review notes that while it can be quite expensive, the value is not entirely bad considering its competition.

Some practical considerations noted in the review are:

* The M8 is perfectly practical if you're sitting up front and only trying to carry two people.
* However, it's cramped for rear passengers due to limited legroom and headroom.
This is a review of the BMW 2 Series Active Tourer. Here are the key points:

**Design**

The exterior design of the 2 Series Active Tourer may not be as exciting as an SUV, but its interior can easily match something like a Mercedes GLA.

**Engine and Performance**

There are several engine options available: diesel (150hp), petrol (170hp or 218hp), and plugin hybrid (245hp). The plugin hybrid model can do almost 60 miles on electric power alone. The car is easy to drive in urban areas, with great visibility and a decent turning circle.

**Space and Practicality**

The 2 Series Active Tourer offers plenty of rear seat space and interior storage. However, the boot is smaller than expected from an MPV. There are also handy shopping bag hooks, tethering points, and underfloor storage in the boot.

**Infotainment and Accessories**

The BMW 2 Series Active Tourer has a quality-feeling interior which can easily compare to cars like the Audi Q2. The infotainment system is easy to use, with a 10.25-inch digital driver's display and a 10.7-inch touchscreen in one single curved piece of glass.

**MPG, Emissions, and Tax**

There are several engine options available on the 2 Series Active Tourer, including diesel (150hp), petrol (170hp or 218hp), and plugin hybrid (245hp). The plugin hybrid model can do almost 60 miles on electric power alone.

**Reliability and Problems**

All new BMW models come with a three-year warranty. There have been two reliability issues reported: both relate to a software issue meaning the airbag warning light won't display if there's a fault.

**Price and Value**

The price of the BMW 2 Series Active Tourer is around £49,798. It's worth noting that the car is less expensive than the Mercedes B-Class, but more expensive than the Audi Q2.

Overall, the BMW 2 Series Active Tourer is a well-made car with a quality-feeling interior. It's easy to drive and has plenty of features to make it a great choice for families or those who need a reliable car. However, its design may not be as exciting as an SUV, but its interior can easily match something like a Mercedes GLA.

The provided text appears to be a review or an article about the new BMW X3 model, covering various aspects such as design, performance, features, and practicality.

Here are some key points from the text:

**Design and Features**

* The new BMW X3 has a distinctive exterior design with a clean look, a new grille, and smooth lines.
* Inside, there's a large twin-screen infotainment setup, an interesting knitted texture on the dashboard, and ambient lighting that shines through translucent plastic trim.

**Performance and Drive Comfort**

* The engine options are relatively quiet and refined on the motorway, but regular models aren't much fun to drive.
* The plugin hybrid model is superior in terms of drive comfort thanks to its ability to drive on electric power alone.
* Visibility is good, with a large rear quarter window minimizing blind spots.

**Space and Practicality**

* The front seats are roomy, but rear passengers get only average space.
* There's limited storage for smaller items, including cupholders that are big but door bins aren't very spacious.
* A six-foot passenger can get comfortable in the back of a Mercedes GLC or VW Tiguan.

**Infotainment and Accessories**

* The infotainment system is good, with a huge screen for driver information and a separate screen for infotainment.
* The cabin looks cool with its reliance on ambient lighting strips rather than chrome trim.
* However, there are some cheap materials visible once you poke around.

**MPG, Emissions, and Tax**

* All engines return very different fuel economy figures.
* The entry-level unit is the 208hp 20i petrol, which claims to return around 40mpg but may be closer to 35mpg in reality.
* The plugin hybrid model has up to 56 miles of allelectric range on a charge and potentially great choice for company car drivers.

**Safety and Security**

* Every model gets plenty of driving assistance kit as standard, including lane departure warning, speed limit info, and lane change warnings.
* BMW's systems are fairly unobtrusive in use, and you can turn off the irritating speed limit warnings simply by holding down the SET button on the steering wheel.

**Reliability and Problems**

* The new X3 is a new model with no reliability data yet.
* However, the latest 3 Series and 5 Series models both posted pretty good scores in the latest Driver Power owner satisfaction survey.

Overall, this text seems to be a detailed review of the new BMW X3 model, covering its design, performance features, practicality, infotainment system, safety features, reliability data, and more.

It appears that you've provided a detailed review or analysis of the BMW i7 electric saloon car. Here's a rewritten version in a conversational tone:

The BMW i7 is an impressive luxury limousine with some innovative features and technologies. Its comfort and refinement are top-notch, making it a joy to drive on long journeys. However, its design may not be to everyone's taste, as some might find the large kidney grilles and split headlights too bold or divisive.

Inside, the i7 has an exceptionally luxurious cabin with plenty of high-tech features. The digital display is advanced, featuring items like augmented reality for navigation and a 2,000-watt Bowers Wilkins stereo system with exciter bass speakers. However, some users might find it fiddly to use the controls on the infotainment screen.

The i7's boot space is not as big nor as versatile as its competitors', but it still offers plenty of room for storage. The opening in the rear is also quite wide and spacious. Overall, the i7's interior style and fit-and-finish are top-notch, with many nice touches like front air vents hidden within the dash design.

The i7 uses a big 102 kWh battery pack that gives it an official range between 334 and 387 miles on one charge, depending on the model. It can charge at up to 22 kW on AC power from kerbside charging points, with a full charge taking just over six hours. The i7 is zerorated for VED car tax, so company car buyers will pay only two percent in BIK tax.

The i7 comes standard with four-wheel drive, traction control, stability control, radarguided cruise control, forward collision alert and emergency braking, lanekeeping steering, all-round cameras and parking sensors, speed limit assistance, and evasion assistance for the steering. It also has a blindspot monitor, rear cross traffic alert, and warning system to prevent door opening when a cyclist is nearby.

The i7's reliability rating is improving, although its not as impressive as Lexus or Genesis. BMW offers a standard three-year unlimited mileage warranty.

The article is about the BMW M5 Touring, a high-performance car that combines the features of an estate car with the exceptional driving dynamics of the M5. Here are some key points:

**Performance**

* The M5 Touring has a twin-turbocharged V8 hybrid engine producing 727hp and dispatching 0-60mph in just 3.6 seconds.
* The car comes with adaptive drive settings for the engine, gearbox, suspension, and even brakes to tailor the driving style to your preference.

**Design**

* The M5 Touring has an enormous cabin space, but it's not ideal for those who want a sporty seating position due to the underfloor battery packs.
* The interior is similar to the standard 5 Series model with only small differences in design and features like a new flat-bottom steering wheel.

**Practicality**

* The M5 Touring has plenty of room inside for passengers, but it's not as practical as other variants like the Audi RS6 Avant or MercedesAMG E53 Estate.
* It has less boot capacity compared to its closest alternatives on sale (MercedesAMG E53 Estate and Audi RS6 Avant) with 500litres available.

**Features**

* The M5 Touring is a very fast car that hides its weight well, even on uneven roads or in potholed roads.
* It comes with a useable real-world range of around 30 miles if driven gently under electric power alone.
* A programmable M button on the steering wheel allows you to save your settings for the driving dynamics.

**Tax and emissions**

* The BMW M5 is very low in CO2 emissions, which avoids the worst first-year tax hit and puts it into the 8 benefitinkind company car tax bracket.
* Drivers with a lead foot will see less than 10mpg in the real-world scenario.

**Safety**

* The M5 Touring takes its crash safety rating from the regular 5 Series saloon, which is nearidentical under the skin.
* It comes with an active cruise control system but it's optional on some models.

Overall, the BMW M5 Touring is a very fast car that offers a combination of rapid pace and dog-friendly boot space. It has plenty of standard kit as expected considering its price, and it can be configured to suit your driving style in multiple ways. However, its practicality suffers somewhat compared to other variants like the Audi RS6 Avant or MercedesAMG E53 Estate.

It's worth noting that there are some minor flaws and limitations in this car such as:

* The infotainment system is a bit of a faff to navigate with all menus and submenus.
* There are not enough physical buttons for navigation on the main display screen, which can be distracting on the move.
* There are just too many menus, submenus and settings to choose from for the driver, making it a bit much to use.

However, these limitations seem minor compared to the overall positive features of this car.

The provided text is a review of the Peugeot E3008 electric car model, but it seems to be incomplete or missing some parts. However, I'll try to provide a summary based on what's available.

**Design and Features**

The Peugeot E3008 is one of the most distinctive-looking cars on the market today. Its sporty design is both impressive and frustrating at the same time, with some features feeling unnatural in certain settings. The dual-motor version promises a sportier driving experience but fails to deliver due to its grabby brakes.

**Space and Practicality**

There's plenty of room for passengers despite the sloping roofline, although rear knee room is tight. The car has loads of space inside, including a spacious cabin with many clever storage solutions around it.

**Infotainment and Accessories**

The interior design is one of the most interesting in its class, with upmarket materials that rival those found in posh German cars. However, there are some hard plastic trims. The car also features a 21-inch widescreen display housing both the infotainment and instrument cluster.

**Electric Range, Charging, and Tax**

The entry-level E3008 is available with a single electric motor powered by a 73kWh battery, giving it an official range of up to 327 miles. The long-range model has a highly impressive claimed range of 415 miles. All E3008s are subject to the luxury car tax in years two to six on top of the typical flat rate of road tax after the first year.

**Safety and Security**

The Peugeot E3008 earned four out of five stars when tested by safety experts, scoring only 6/2 for its safety assistance tech. The entry-level Allure model comes with post-collision braking, lane-keeping assistance, emergency braking system with nighttime detection of pedestrians and cyclists, basic cruise control, but GT versions upgrade this to adaptive cruise control.

**Reliability and Problems**

The Peugeot brand has turned things around in recent years after having a reputation for being unreliable. The three-year, unlimited-mileage warranty offered is standard across most car manufacturers in the UK.

Given what we have here, it's clear that:

* The Peugeot E3008 is an impressive but somewhat frustrating car to drive.
* It has plenty of room inside with many clever storage solutions around it.
* The interior design is one of the most interesting in its class.
* The safety and security features are not very high-scoring.

However, I couldn't find any information on the following topics: condition, rating, price, and price breakdown by trim level.
It seems like you've provided a detailed review of the Peugeot e-308, including its features, performance, and overall experience. Here's a summary:

**Pros:**

* The e-308 has a comfortable driving experience, with a pleasant ride quality despite some wind noise.
* It's a well-rounded car for daily driving, with good handling and braking.
* The interior is classy and high-quality, with a modern design and decent stowage space.
* The infotainment system is not the most intuitive, but it's improved compared to previous attempts.

**Cons:**

* The e-308 has less power than other electric cars in its class, making it feel sluggish at times.
* It lacks an onepedal driving mode and regenerative braking, which can make city driving more difficult.
* The rear seats are not the most comfortable for adults due to the high door sill and lack of front ISOFIX fitting.

**Overall:**

The Peugeot e-308 is a solid electric car that offers a good overall experience. While it may not be the best in its class, it's still a great choice for those looking for a reliable and efficient ride. However, it's essential to consider the following:

* The e-308 has less efficiency and range compared to other electric cars in its class.
* It's limited by its slow charging rate (100 kW) and lower mileage per kWh rating (3.8 miles).
* Company car benefits are available for high-rate tax payers, including savings on EV running costs.

**Recommendations:**

Based on the review, it seems like a good idea to consider the following:

* Look into other electric cars in its class that offer more power and efficiency.
* Research company car benefits and EV running cost savings to determine if they're available.
* Weigh the pros and cons of the e-308 against your needs and budget.

Please let me know if you'd like me to provide a specific recommendation or answer any questions regarding this review.
I'll provide an analysis of the text based on the provided information.

* It features a high-tech interior, including a large central screen infotainment system.
* The car has a premium feel inside, but some users might find the small steering wheel to be odd.

**Performance**

* The Peugeot 308 comes with various engine options, including petrol, diesel, hybrid, and electric models.
* The diesel model is probably the best choice for those doing a lot of motorway miles.
* The hybrid system provides regenerative braking functionality, but might slow down the car to almost a stop.

**Space and Practicality**

* The Peugeot 308 has a premium feel inside, with plenty of storage space throughout the cabin.
* It features a large rear windows that let in lots of light and help visibility from the front.
* There is more boot space than in many similar hatchbacks, but it's not ideal for heavy loads.

**Tax and Emissions**

* The hybrid model emits just 25g/km, making it eligible for zero road tax in the first year.
* Company car buyers get the lowest benefit-in-kind rate in the range with this engine option.

**Safety**

* Adult occupant safety is a four-star weakness in the French model's safety ratings.
* Vulnerable road user protection and safety assist ratings were 68 and 65 respectively.
* All models feature autonomous emergency braking to protect vulnerable road users, as well as lane keeping assist technology.

Overall, this car review suggests that while there are some weaknesses in the Peugeot 308 design, it generally offers a positive driving experience with plenty of standard features across the range.
This is a detailed review of the Peugeot 408 from Carwow, covering various aspects such as design, performance, space, infotainment, and safety features.

Here are some key points:

**Design**

The Peugeot 408 has a unique design that combines elements of an SUV and a saloon. It's not too bold in either direction, making it hard to pinpoint its style.

**Performance**

The hybrid versions have decent performance, but the electric mode is quiet and refined, while the normal and sport modes are less so. The brakes can be grabby at times. Visibility is okay looking forward, but poor from the back due to the sloping bodywork.

**Space and Practicality**

The 408 has ample space for passengers in the front, with decent legroom in the back as well. However, headroom is limited, and the middle rear seat is cramped. The boot space is good at 536 liters (petrol) or 471 liters (hybrid), but decreases with optional Focal sound system.

**Infotainment**

The infotainment system is excellent, with a 10-inch screen as standard across the range. It's easy to use and has crisp graphics. The digital dials are a highlight, displaying 3D effects that look great.

**MPG, Emissions, and Tax**

There are three engine options: a 1.2-liter hybrid petrol engine making 136hp (up to 58mpg), plugin hybrids with 180hp or 225hp (51mpg in mixed driving), and an electric-only version (allelectric E408) with low emissions.

**Safety and Security**

The Peugeot 408 has standard safety features including post-collision safety brake, lane keep assist, and automatic emergency braking. The Drive Assist Pack adds rear cross traffic alert, adaptive cruise control, and long-range blind spot monitoring on the Allure Premium trim.

**Reliability**

It's too early to tell whether there are any ongoing issues with the Peugeot 408. However, Peugeots reputation for reliability has been improving recently.

The overall rating for this car is based on several factors:

- Its unique design combines SUV and saloon elements.
- It's surprisingly affordable considering its features.
- The infotainment system is excellent.
- Safety features are standard across the range.
- Reliability has been improving, although it's too early to tell whether there are any ongoing issues.

However, some potential downsides are:

- It can be tricky to work out where the 408 fits among alternatives you might consider.
- Some parts of its interior design may not appeal to everyone.
- The rear seats in the back can feel cramped due to the middle seat being relatively useless.

This is a detailed review of the BYD Atto 3 model, but I'll try to provide a summarized answer based on the text.

The main points about the BYD Atto 3 are:

* The car has some issues with its interior design being overstyled and trying too hard to mimic other styles.
* Some users might find the door panels and stereo speakers styled to look like guitar strings as odd.
* However, the infotainment system is excellent, with a responsive touchscreen and good connectivity options.
* Apple CarPlay and Android Auto work well, but they don't function properly in portrait mode due to issues with pixel angles.

The car's exterior design is not its strongest point, but it tries to be stylish by copying other designs. 

In terms of driving the Atto 3, it:

* Is comfortable around town, thanks to soft suspension and good visibility.
* However, on the motorway, there's noticeable wind noise and the car doesn't feel very stable on country roads.

The battery efficiency is not great, with an average of only 3.3 miles per kWh on our test, which equals a real-world range of around 190 miles against the claimed 260-mile range.

The Atto 3 has some issues with its charging speed too, but it does offer bidirectional charging, allowing you to use your battery to charge other things like an ebike or scooter.

Some safety features are included in all versions of the car, such as blind spot detection and traction control.

However, there's no information on how reliable the Atto 3 might be yet since it's a new model from a relatively small manufacturer.

Here is a summary of the provided text:

**Model Overview**

The GWM Ora 03 is an electric vehicle with a funky design inspired by Volkswagen Beetle and Mini. It has a spacious cabin with high-quality materials, but some issues with infotainment system navigation.

**Design and Features**

* The car's interior is spacious and features high-quality materials.
* There are two battery options: Pure (48 Kwh) with 193 miles range and Pro (63KWh) with 260 miles range.
* Charging speeds vary between models, with the Pure model able to charge at up to 64 kW in 40 minutes.
* The car comes standard with a suite of driver assistance systems.

**Driving Experience**

* On the motorway, wind noise becomes annoying and steering can be loose on bends.
* A single pedal driving mode is included for city driving comfort.
* Adaptive cruise control and lane keep assist help reduce stress on long trips.

**Space and Practicality**

* Cabin space is roomy enough to accommodate adults comfortably.
* Rear space allows for comfortable seating with ample legroom, though it can be a squeeze with three passengers.
* The boot is relatively small at 228 liters, making it less practical than other cars like the Volkswagen ID3.

**Specifications**

* Two trim levels are available: Pure and Pro.
* Differences between models include range (193 miles for Pure vs. 260 miles for Pro), features such as massage seats, parking assist, etc.
* Voice commands work well with some limitations on infotainment system navigation.
* All cars feature a range of driver assistance systems.

**Warranty**

It is unclear whether the Ora 03 will be reliable due to GWM being an unfamiliar brand in the UK market. However, electric vehicles tend to be more reliable than combustion-engined cars.

**Design and Features:**

* The Xpeng G6's design is described as smooth and sleek, with a minimalist interior that apes Tesla.
* The car features a massive 15-inch touchscreen display in the center console.
* Physical switchgear is limited to the steering wheel, window switches, and column stalks.
* The rear seats can recline, and the whole affair can even fold flat for incar camping with an optional mattress accessory.

**Performance:**

* The Xpeng G6's suspension doesn't absorb bumps very well, making it feel bouncy over potholes and speed humps.
* The car is not very fun to drive, feeling heavy in the corners and lacking directional agility.
* However, the car performs well enough around town, with an instant power delivery that's typical of EVs.

**Space and Practicality:**

* The G6 has a 571-liter boot space, which is quite good but can't compete with the massive Tesla Model Y.
* Rear seat space is excellent for three occupants, with loads of legroom and enough headroom for people over six feet.
* There are twin USBC ports and air vents in the center console, while the folddown rear seats recline by a few degrees.

**Electric Range and Charging:**

* The Standard Range car claims around 270 miles on a charge, while the Long Range car is identically-priced to the base-spec Tesla Model Y with a claimed 311-mile range.
* During a week's testing of the Long Range G6, it came close to the indicated range figure over mixed mileage.
* Both models support fast charging on public chargers (215kW for Standard and 280kW for Long), as well as home charging at 11 kW.

**Taxation:**

* As a fully electric car, the Xpeng G6 pays the lowest rates of Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) and company car tax.
* If you go for the entry-level Standard Range car, you dodge the expensive car supplement on years two to six of your VED bill, but adding even a paint color will tip you over that threshold.

**Safety and Security:**

* The Xpeng G6 scored a full five-star safety rating from the European safety standards.
* All necessary safety equipment is present and correct, with no difficult-to-disable annoying ones.

**Reliability and Problems:**

* Xpeng is a new company to Europe and has limited dealer coverage in the UK (six service centers at the time of writing).
* However, they offer a very generous seven-year, 100,000-mile warranty on both cars and battery.
